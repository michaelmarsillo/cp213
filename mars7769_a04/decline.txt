THE DECLINE 

AND FALL OF THE 

ROMAN EMPIRE 

By EDWARD GIBBON 

( T 737- I 794&gt; 

Gibbon is one of those rcw writers who 
hold as high a place in the history of litera- 
ture as in the roll of great historians. He 
is the clearest example that brilliance of 
style and accuracy of statement are per- 
fectly compatible in an historian* 

The Decline and Fall can be divided 
roughly into three parts. The first third 
covers two hundred years and ends with 
the advent of the fifth century, A. D. The 
last two thirds are devoted to the thou- 
sand years that ended with the acquisi- 
tion of the absolute dominion of Rome by 
the Popes in 1500. 

Gibbon's work, completed a hundred 
and fifty years ago, remains today the last 
and authoritative word on the subject.

THE 
HISTORY OF THE DECLINE AND FALL 

OF THE 

ROMAN EMPIRE 

CHAPTER XLIX (726-1378 A.D.) 

introduction, Worship, and Persecution of Images Revolt of Italy and Rome 
Temporal Dominion of the Popes Conquest of Italy by the Franks 
Establishment of Images Character and Coronation of Charlemagne 
Restoration anrf Decay of the Roman Empire in the West Independence 
of Italy Constitution of the Germanic Body 

IN the connection of the church and state I have considered the former 
as subservient only, and relative, to the latter; a salutary maxim, if in 
fact as well as in narrative it had ever been held sacred. The oriental 
philosophy of the Gnostics, the dark abyss of predestination and grace, 
and the strange transformation of the Eucharist from the sign to the 
substance of Christ's body, 1 I have purposely abandoned to the curi- 
osity of speculative divines. But I have reviewed with diligence and 
pleasure the objects of ecclesiastical history by which the decline and 
fall of the Roman empire were materially affected, the propagation 
of Christianity, the constitution of the Catholic church, the ruin of 
Paganism, and the sects that arose from the mysterious controversies 
concerning the Trinity and incarnation. At the head of this class 
we may justly rank the worship of images, so fiercely disputed in the 
eighth and ninth centuries; since a question of popular superstition 
produced the revolt of Italy, the temporal power of the popes, and 
the restoration of the Roman empire in the West. 

The primitive Christians were possessed with an unconquerable 
repugnance to the use and abuse of images; and this aversion may be 
ascribed to their descent from the Jews, and their enmity to the 
Greeks. The Mosaic law had severely proscribed all representations 
of the Deity; and that precept was firmly established in the principles 
and practite of the chosen people. The wit of the Christian apologists 
was pointed against the foolish idolaters who bowed before the work- 
manship of their own hands: the images of brass and marble, which, 
had they been endowed with sense and motion, should have started 
rather from the pedestal to adore the creative powers of the artist. 2 

*The learned Selden has given the history of transubstantiation in a com- 
prehensive and pithy sentence: "The opinion is only rhetoric turned into logic." 
(His Works, vol. iii. p. 2073, in his Table-Talk.} 

*Nec intelligunt homines ineptissimi, qu6d si sentire simulacra et movexi 
possent, [ultro] adoratura hominem fuisscnt &amp; quo sunt expolita. (Divin. 
Institut 1, ii. c. 2.) Lactantius is the last, as well as the most eloquent, of 
the Latin apologists. Their raillery of idols attacks not only the object, but 
the form and matter. 



a THE DECLINE AND FALt OF 

Perhaps some recent and imperfect converts of the Gnostic tribe might 
crown the statues of Christ and St. Paul with the profane honours 
which they paid to those of Aristotle and Pythagoras; 3 but the public 
religion of the Catholics was uniformly simple and spiritual; and the 
first notice of the use of pictures is in the censure of the council of 
Illiberis, three hundred years after the Christian aera. Under the suc- 
cessors of Constantine, in the peace and luxury of the triumphant 
church, the more prudent bishops condescended to indulge a visible 
superstition for the benefit of the multitude; and after the ruin of 
Paganism they were no longer restrained by the apprehension of an 
odious parallel. The first introduction of a symbolic worship was in 
the veneration of the cross and of relics. The saints and martyrs, 
whose intercession was implored, were seated on the right hand of 
God; but the gracious and often supernatural favours which, in the 
popular belief, were showered round their tomb, conveyed an unques- 
tionable sanction of the devout pilgrims who visited, and touched, 
and kissed these lifeless remains, the memorials of their merits and 
sufferings. 4 But a memorial more interesting than the skull or the 
sandals of a departed worthy is the faithful copy of his person and 
features, delineated by the arts of painting or sculpture. In every 
age such copies, so congenial to human feelings, have been cherished 
by the zeal of private friendship or public esteem: the images of the 
Roman emperors were adored with civil and almost religious honours; 
a reverence less ostentatious, but more sincere, was applied to the 
statues of sages and patriots; and these profane virtues, these splendid 
sins, disappeared in the presence of the holy men who had died for 
their celestial and everlasting country. At first the experiment was 
made with caution and scruple; and the venerable pictures were dis- 
creetly allowed to instruct the ignorant, to awaken the cold, and to 
gratify the prejudices of the heathen proselytes. By a slow though 
inevitable progression the honours of the original were transferred to 
the copy: the devout Christian prayed before the image of a saint; 
and the Pagan rites of genuflexion, luminaries, and incense again stole 
into the Catholic church. The scruples of reason or piety were 
silenced by the strong evidence of visions and miracles; and the pictures 
which speak, and move, and bleed, must be endowed with t divine 
energy, and may be considered as the proper objects of religious adora- 
tion. The most audacious pencil might tremble in the rash attempt 
of defining by forms and colours the infinite Spirit, the eternal Father, 
who pervades and sustains the universe. 8 But the superstitious mind 

8 See Irenaeus, Epiphanius, and Augustin (Basnage, 4 Hist des EgJises 
Reiormees, torn. H. p. 1313). This Gnostic practice has a singular affinity with 
the private worship of Alexander Severus (Lampridius, c. 29; Lardner, 
Heathen Testimonies, vol. iii. p. 34).

THE ROMAN EMPIRE 3 

was more easily reconciled to paint and to worship the angels, and 
above all, the Son of God, under the human shape which on earth 
they have condescended to assume. The second person of the Trinity 
had been clothed with a real and mortal body; but that body had 
ascended into heaven: and had not some similitude been presented, 
to the eyes of his disciples, the spiritual worship of Christ might 
have been obliterated by the visible relics and representations of the 
saints. A similar indulgence was requisite and propitious for the Vir- 
gin Mary: the place of her burial was unknown; and the assumption 
of her soul and body into heaven was adopted by the credulity of the 
Greeks and Latins. The use, and even the worship, of images was 
firmly established before the end of the sixth century: they were fondly 
cherished by the warm imagination of the Greeks and Asiatics: the 
Pantheon and Vatican were adorned with the emblems of a new 
superstition; but this semblance of idolatry was more coldly enter- 
tained by the rude barbarians and the Arian clergy of the West. The 
bolder forms of sculpture, in brass or marble, which peopled the 
temples of antiquity, were offensive to the fancy or conscience of the 
Christian Greeks; and a smooth surface of colours has ever been 
esteemed a more decent and harmless mode of imitation. 6 

The merit and effect of a copy depends on its resemblance with the 
original; but the primitive Christians were ignorant of the genuine fea- 
tures of the Son of God, his mother, and his apostles: the statue of 
Christ at Paneas, in Palestine, 7 was more probably that of some tem- 
poral saviour; the Gnostics and their profane monuments were repro- 
bated, and the fancy of the Christian artists could only be guided by 
the clandestine imitation of some heathen model. In this distress a 
bold and dexterous invention assured at once the likeness of the image 
and the innocence of the worship. A new superstructure of fable was 
raised on the popular basis of a Syrian legend on the correspondence 
of Christ and Abgarus, so famous in the days of Eusebius, so reluo

J&amp;ms-Christ et des Saints (Dupin, Biblioth. Ecclds. torn. vL p. 154).

notoriously in the right, that they can venture to be impartiaL .See the perplexity 
of poor Friar Pagi, Critica, torn. i. p. 42. 

''After removing some rubbish of miracle and inconsistency, it may be 
allowed that, as late as the year 300, Paneas in Palestine was decorated with 
a bronze statue, representing a grave personage wrapped in a cloak, with a 
grateful or suppliant female kneeling before him, and that an inscription 
r$ S&amp;nwH, r$ fl&lt;p7*T3~~ was perhaps inscribed on the pedestal. By the Chris- 
tians this group was foolishly explained of their founder and the poor 
woman whom he had cured of the bloody flux (Euseb. vii. 18; Philostorg, 
vii. 3, etc.). M. de Beausobre more reasonably conjectures the philosopher 
Apollonius, or the emperor Vespasian; in the latter supposition the female is 
a city, a province, or perhaps the queen Berenice (Bibfiotheque Germanise, 
torn. xiii. p. 1-92).

tantly deserted by our modern advocates. The bishop of Caesarea* 
records the epistle, 9 but he most strangely forgets the picture of 
Christ 10 the perfect impression of his face on a linen, with which he 
gratified the faith of the royal stranger who had invoked his healing 
power, and offered the strong city of Edessa to protect him against the 
malice of the Jews. The ignorance of the primitive church is explained 
by the long imprisonment of the image in a niche of the wall, from 
whence, after an oblivion of five hundred years, it was released by 
some prudent bishop, and seasonably presented to the devotion of the 
times. Its first and most glorious exploit was the deliverance of the 
city from the arms of Chosroes Nushirvan; and it was soon revered as 
a pledge of the divine promise that Edessa should never be taken by a 
foreign enemy. It is true, indeed, that the text of Procopius ascribes 
the double deliverance of Edessa to the wealth and valour of her citi- 
zens, who purchased the absence and repelled the assaults of the Per- 
sian monarch. He was ignorant, the profane historian, of the testimony 
which he is compelled to deliver in the ecclesiastical page of Evagrius, 
that the Palladium was exposed on the rampart, and that the water 
which had been sprinkled on the holy face, instead of quenching, 
added new fuel to the flames of the besieged. After this important 
service the image of Edessa was preserved with respect and gratitude; 
and if the Armenians rejected the legend, the more credulous Greeks 
adored the similitude, which was not the work of any mortal pencil, 
but the immediate creation of the divine original. The style and 
sentiments of a Byzantine hymn will declare how far their worship 
was removed from the grossest idolatry. "How can we with mortal 
eyes contemplate this image, whose celestial splendour the host of 
heaven presumes not to behold? HE who dwells in heaven condescends 
this day to visit us by his venerable image; HE who is seated on the 
cherubim visits us this day by a picture, which the Father has deline- 

8 Euseb. Hist. Ecctes. 1. i. c. 13. The learned Assemannus has brought up 
the collateral aid of three Syrians, St. Ephrem, Josua Stylites, and James 
bishop of Sarug; but I dp not find any notice of the Syriac original or the 
archives of Edessa (Biblioth. Orient, torn. i. p. 318, 420, 554) ; their vague 
belief is probably derived from the Greeks. 

9 The evidence for these epistles is stated and rejected by the candid Lardncr 
(Heathen Testimonies, vol. i. p. 297-309)* Among the herd of bigots who arc 
forcibly driven from this convenient but untenable post, I am ashamed with 
the Grabes, Caves, Tillemonts, etc., to discover Mr. Addison, an English 
gentleman (His Works, vol. i. p. 528, Baskerville's edition) ; but his super- 
ficial tract on the Christian religion owes its credit to his name, his style, 
and the interested applause of our clergy. 

"From the silence of James of Sarug (Asseman. Biblioth. Orient, p, 280, 
318), and the testimony of Evagrius (Hist. Ecclte. I iv. a 27), I conclude that 
this fable was invented between the years 521 and $04, most probably after the 
siege of Edessa in 540 (Asseman. torn. i. p. 416; Procopius, de Bell. Persic. 
L 11. [c. 12, torn. i. p. 208 sq., ed. Bonn]). It is the sword and buckler of 
Gregory II. (in Epist. i. ad Leon. Isaur. Concil. torn. viii. p. 6;6, 6J7), of 
John Damascenes (Opera, torn, i, p. 281, edit Lequien [De Fide Orthod. 1. iv. 
c, JOj), and of the second Nicene Council (Actio v. p. 1030). The most 
perfect edition may be found in Cedrenus (Compend. p. 175-178 [ed. Par.: 
torn. i. p. 308-314, ed. Bonn]). 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 5 

ated with his immaculate hand, which he has formed in an ineffable 
manner, and which we sanctify by adoring it with fear and love." Be- 
fore the end of the sixth century these images, made without hands (in 
Greek it is a single word 11 ), were propagated in the camps and cities 
of the Eastern empire; 12 they were the objects of worship, and the 
instruments of miracles; and in the hour of danger or tumult their 
venerable presence could revive the hope, rekindle the courage, or re- 
press the fury of ^ the Roman legions. Of these pictures the far greater 
part, the transcripts of a human pencil, could only pretend to a sec- 
ondary likeness and improper title; but there were some of higher 
descent, who derived their resemblance from an immediate contact with 
the original, endowed for that purpose with a miraculous and prolific 
virtue. The most ambitious aspired from a filial to a fraternal rela- 
tion with the image of Edessa; and such is the veronica of Rome, or 
Spain, or Jerusalem, which Christ in his agony and bloody sweat ap- 
plied to his face, and delivered to a holy matron. The fruitful prece- 
dent was speedily transferred to the Virgin Mary, and the saints and 
martyrs. In the church of Diospolis, in Palestine, the features of the 
Mother of God 13 were deeply inscribed in a marble column: the East 
and West have been decorated by the pencil of St. Luke; and the 
Evangelist, who was perhaps a physician, has been forced to exercise 
the occupation of a painter, so profane and odious in the eyes of the 
primitive Christians. The Olympian Jove, created by the muse of 
Homer and the chisel of Phidias, might inspire a philosophic mind with 
momentary devotion; but these Catholic images were faintly and flatly 
delineated by monkish artists in the last degeneracy of taste and 
genius. 14 

The worship of images had stolen into the church by insensible de- 
grees, and each petty step was pleasing to the superstitious mind, as 
productive of comfort and innocent of sin. But in the beginning of 

u 'Ax/wiro^i7Tw. See Ducange, in Gloss. Grae. et Lat. The subject is treated 
with equal learning and bigotry by the Jesuit Gretser (Syntagma de Imagin- 
ibus non Manfi factis, ad calcem Codini de Officiis, p. 289-330), the ass, or 
rather the fox, of Ingoldstadt (see the Scaligerana) ; with equal reason and 
wit by the Protestant Beausobre, in the ironical controversy which he has 
spread through many volumes of the Bibliotheqtte Germanique (torn, xviii. 
p. 1-50; xx. p. 27-68; xxv. p. 1-36; xxvii. p. 85-118; xxviii. p. 1-33; xxxi.

the eighth century, in the full magnitude of the abuse, the more tim- 
orous Greeks were awakened by an apprehension that, under the mask 
of Christianity, they had restored the religion of their fathers: they 
heard, with grief and impatience, the name of idolators the incessant 
charge of the Jews and Mohammedans, 15 who derived from the Law 
and the Koran an immortal hatred to graven images and all relative 
worship. The servitude of the Jews might curb their zeal and depre- 
ciate their authority; but the triumphant Mussulmans, who reigned at 
Damascus, and threatened Constantinople, cast into the scale of re- 
proach the accumulated weight of truth and victory. The cities of 
Syria, Palestine, and Egypt had been fortified with the images of 
Christ, his mother, and his saints; and each city presumed on the 
hope or promise of miraculous defence. In a rapid conquest of ten 
years the Arabs subdued those cities and these images; and, in their 
opinion, the Lord of Hosts pronounced a decisive judgment between 
the adoration and contempt of these mute and inanimate idols. 16 For 
a while Edessa had braved the Persian assaults; but the chosen city, 
the spouse of Christ, was involved in the common ruin; and his divine 
resemblance became the slave and trophy of the infidels. After a 
servitude of three hundred years, the Palladium was yielded to the 
devotion of Constantinople, for a ransom of twelve thousand pounds 
of silver, the redemption of two hundred Mussulmans, and a perpetual 
truce for the territory of Edessa. 17 In this season of distress and dis- 
may the eloquence of the monks was exercised in the defence of 
images; and they attempted to prove that the sin and schism of the 
greatest part of the Orientals had forfeited the favour and annihilated 
the virtue of these precious symbols. But they were now opposed by 
the murmurs of many simple or rational Christians, who appealed to 
the evidence of texts, of facts, and of the primitive times, and secretly 
desired the reformation of the church. As the worship of images had 
never been established by any general or positive law, its progress in 
the Eastern empire had been retarded, or accelerated, by the differences 
of men and manners, the local degrees of refinement, and the personal 
characters of the bishops. The splendid devotion was fondly cherished 
by the levity of the capital and the inventive genius of the Byzantine 
clergy; while the rude and remote districts of Asia were strangers to 

18 By Cedrenus, Zonaras, Glycas, and Manasses, the origin of the Icono- 
clasts is imputed to the caliph Yezid and two Jews, who promised the empire 
to Leo; and the reproaches of these hostile sectaries are turned into an absurd 
conspiracy for restoring the purity of the Christian worship (see Spanheim, 
Hist. Imag, c. 2). 

M [Yezid, ninth caliph of the race of the Ommiadse, caused all the images 
in Syria to be destroyed about the year 720; hence the orthodox reproached 
the sectarians with following the example of the Saracens and the Jews.

A.D. 944), The prudent Franciscan refuses to determine whether the image 
of Edessa now reposes at Rome or Genoa; but its repose is inglorious, and 
this ancient object of worship is no longer famous or fashionable.

this innovation of sacred luxury. Many large congregations of Gnos- 
tics and Arians maintained, after their conversion, the simple worship 
which had preceded their separation; and the Armenians, the most 
warlike subjects of Rome, were not reconciled, in the twelfth century, 
to the sight of images. 18 These various denominations of men afforded 
a fund of prejudice and aversion, of small account in the villages of 
Anatolia or Thrace, but which, in the fortune of a soldier, a prelate, 
or a eunuch, might be often connected with the powers of the church 
and state. 

Of such adventurers the most fortunate was the emperor Leo the 
Third, 10 who, from the mountains of Isauria, ascended the throne of 
the East. He was ignorant of sacred and profane letters: but his edu- 
cation, his reason, perhaps his intercourse with the Jews and Arabs, 
had inspired the martial peasant with a hatred of images; and it was 
held to be the duty of a prince to impose on his subjects the dictates 
of his own conscience. But in the outset of an unsettled reign, during 
ten years of toil and danger, Leo submitted to the meanness of hypoc- 
risy, bowed before the idols which he despised, and satisfied the Roman 
pontiff with the annual professions of his orthodoxy and zeal. In 
the reformation of religion his first steps were moderate and cautious: 
he assembled a great council of senators and bishops, and enacted, with 
their consent, that all the images should be removed from the sanctu- 
ary and altar to a proper height in the churches, where they might 
be visible to the eyes, and inaccessible to the superstition, of the 
people. But it was impossible on either side to check the rapid though 
adverse impulse of veneration and abhorrence: in their lofty position 
the sacred images still edified their votaries and reproached the tyrant. 
He was himself provoked by resistance and invective; and his own 
party accused him of an imperfect discharge of his duty, and urged for 
his imitation the example of the Jewish king, who had broken without 
scruple the brazen serpent of the temple. By a second edict he pro- 
scribed the existence as well as the use of religious pictures; the 
churches of Constantinople and the provinces were cleansed from 
idolatry; the images of Christ, the Virgin, and the saints were demol- 
ished, or a smooth surface of plaster was spread over the walls of the

(Kicetas, L ii. p. 258 [ed. Par.; p. 527, ed. Bonn]). The Armenian churches 
arc still content with the Cross (Missions du Levant, torn. iii. p. 148) ; but 
surely the superstitious Greek is unjust to the superstition of the Germans of 
the twelfth century.

Ccdrenus, Zonaras, etc. Of the modern Catholics, Baromus, Pagi, Natalis

edifice. The sect of the Iconoclasts was supported by the zeal and 
despotism of six emperors/ and the East and West were involved in a 
noisy conflict of one hundred and twenty years. It was the design 
of Leo the Isaurian to pronounce the condemnation of images as an 
article of faith, and by the authority of a general council: but the con- 
vocation of such an assembly was reserved for his son Constantine; 20 
and though it is stigmatised by 'triumphant bigotry as a meeting of 
fools and atheists, their own partial and mutilated acts betray many 
symptoms of reason and piety. The debates and decrees of many 
provincial synods introduced the summons of the general council which 
met in the suburbs of Constantinople, and was composed of the re- 
spectable number of three hundred and thirty-eight bishops of Europe 
and Anatolia; for the patriarchs of Antioch and Alexandria were the 
slaves of the caliph, and- the Roman pontiff had withdrawn the churches 
of Italy and the West from the communion of the Greeks. This Byzan- 
tine synod assumed the rank and powers of the seventh general coun- 
cil; yet even this title was a recognition of the six preceding assemblies, 
which had laboriously built the structure of the Catholic faith. After 
a serious deliberation of six months, the three hundred and thirty-eight 
bishops pronounced and subscribed a unanimous decree, that all visible 
symbols of Christ, except in the Eucharist, were either blasphemous or 
heretical; that image-worship was a corruption of Christianity and a 
renewal of Paganism; that all such monuments of idolatry should be 
broken or erased; and that those who should refuse to deliver the 
objects of their private superstition were guilty of disobedience to the 
authority of the church and of the emperor. In their loud and loyal 
acclamations they celebrated the merits of their temporal redeemer; 
and to his zeal and justice they intrusted the execution of their spir- 
itual censures. At Constantinople, as in the former councils, the will 
of the prince was the rule of episcopal faith; but on this occasion I 
ain inclined to suspect that a large majority of the prelates sacrificed 
their secret conscience to the temptations of hope and fear. In the 
long night of superstition the Christians had wandered far away from 
the simplicity of the Gospel: nor was it easy for them to discern the 
clue, and tread back the mazes of the labyrinth. The worship of 
images was inseparably blended, at least to a pious fancy, with the 
Cross, the Virgin, the saints and their relics; the holy ground was 
involved in a cloud of miracles and visions; and the nerves of the 
mind, curiosity and scepticism, were benumbed by the habits of obedi- 
ence and belief. Constantine himself is accused of indulging a royal 
licence to doubt, or deny, or deride the mysteries of the Catholics, 21

but they were deeply inscribed in the public and private creed of his 
bishops; and the boldest Iconoclast might assault with a secret horror 
the monuments of popular devotion, which were consecrated to the 
honour of his celestial patrons. In the reformation of the sixteenth 
century freedom and knowledge had expanded all the faculties of 
man: the thirst of innovation superseded the reverence of antiquity; 
and the vigour of Europe could disdain those phantoms which terrified 
the sickly and servile weakness of the Greeks. 

The scandal of an abstract heresy can be only proclaimed to the 
people of the blast of the ecclesiastical trumpet; but the most ignorant 
can perceive, the most torpid must feel, the profanation and downfall 
of their visible deities. The first hostilities of Leo were directed against 
a lofty Christ on the vestibule, and above the gate, of the palace. 
A ladder had been planted for the assault, but it was furiously shaken 
by a crowd of zealots and women: they beheld, with pious transport, 
the ministers of sacrilege tumbling from on high and dashed against 
the pavement; and the honours of the ancient martyrs were prosti- 
tuted to these criminals, who justly suffered for murder and rebellion. 22 
The execution of the Imperial edicts was resisted by frequent tumults 
in Constantinople and the provinces: the person of Leo was endan- 
gered, his officers were massacred, and the popular enthusiasm was 
quelled by the strongest efforts of the civil and military power. Of 
the Archipelago, or Holy Sea, the numerous islands were filled with 
images and monks: their votaries abjured, without scruple, the enemy 
of Christ, his mother, and the saints; they armed a fleet of boats and 
galleys, displayed their consecrated banners, and boldly steered for 
the harbour of Constantinople, to place on the throne a new favourite 
of God and the people. They depended on the succour of a miracle: 
but their miracles were inefficient against the Greek fire; and, after 
the defeat and conflagration of their fleet, the naked islands were 
abandoned to the clemency, or justice of the conqueror. The son of 
Leo, in the first year of his reign, had undertaken an expedition against 
the Saracens: during his absence the capital, the palace, and the purple 
were occupied by his kinsman Artavasdes, the ambitious champion of 
the orthodox faith. The worship of images was triumphantly restored: 
the patriarch renounced his dissimulation, or dissembled his senti- 
ments: and the righteous claim of the usurper was acknowledged, both 
in the new and in ancient Rome. Constantine flew for refuge to his 
paternal mountains; but he descended at the head of the bold and 
affectionate Isaurians; and his final victory confounded the arms and 
predictions of the fanatics. His long reign was distracted with clamour, 

of Christ; comparing her after her delivery to an empty purse; of Arianism, 
Nestorianism, etc. In his defence, Spanheim (c. iv. p. 207) is somewhat em- 
barrassed between the interest of a Protestant and the duty of an orthodox 
divine.

sedition, conspiracy, and mutual hatred and sanguinary revenge: the 
persecution of images was the motive or pretence of his adversaries; 
and, if they missed a temporal diadem, they were rewarded by the 
Greeks with the crown of martyrdom. In every act of open and 
clandestine treason the emperor felt the unforgiving enmity of the 
monks, the faithful slaves of the superstition to which they owed their 
riches and influence. They prayed, they preached, they absolved, they 
inflamed, they conspired; the solitude of Palestine poured forth a 
torrent of invective; and the pen of St. John Damascenus, 23 the last 
of the Greek fathers, devoted the tyrant's head, both in this world 
and the next. 24 I am not at leisure to examine how far the monks pro- 
voked, nor how much they have exaggerated, their real and pretended 
sufferings, nor how many lost their lives or limbs, their eyes or their 
beards, by the cruelty of the emperor. From the chastisement of indi- 
viduals he proceeded to the abolition of the order; and, as it was 
wealthy and useless, his resentment might be stimulated by avarice, and 
justified by patriotism. The formidable name and mission of the 
Dragon?* his visitor-general, excited the terror and abhorrence of the 
black nation: the religious communities were dissolved, the buildings 
were converted into magazines or barracks; the lands, movables, and 
cattle were confiscated; and our modern precedents will support the 
charge that much wanton or malicious havoc was exercised against 
the relics, and even the books, of the monasteries. With the habit and 
profession of monks, the public and private worship of images was 
rigorously proscribed; and it should seem that a solemn abjuration of 
idolatry was exacted from the subjects, or at least from the clergy, of 
the Eastern empire. 26 
The patient East abjured with reluctance her sacred images; they 

"John, or Mansur, was a noble Christian of Damascus, who held a con- 
siderable office in the service of the caliph. His zeal in the cause of images 
exposed him to the resentment and treachery of the Greek emperor; and, on 
the suspicion of a treasonable correspondence, he was deprived of his right 
hand, which was miraculously restored by the Virgin. After this deliverance 
he resigned his office, distributed his wealth, and buried himself in the mon- 
astery of St Sabas, between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea. The legend is 
famous; but his learned editor, Father Lequien, has unluckily proved that 
St. John Damascenus was already a monk before the Iconoclast dispute 
(Opera, torn. i. Vit. St Joan. Damascen. p. 10-13, et Notas ad loc.).

were fondly cherished, and vigorously defended, by the independent 
zeal of the Italians. In ecclesiastical rank and jurisdiction the patriarch 
of Constantinople and the pope of Rome were nearly equal. But the 
Greek prelate was a domestic slave under the eye of his master, at 
whose nod he alternately passed from the convent to the throne, and 
from the throne to the convent. A distant and dangerous station, amidst 
the barbarians of the West, excited the spirit and freedom of the Latin 
bishops. Their popular election endeared them to the Romans: the 
public and private indigence was relieved by their ample revenue; and 
the weakness or neglect of the emperors compelled them to consult, 
both in peace and war, the temporal safety of the city. In the school 
of adversity the priest insensibly imbibed the virtues and the ambition 
of a prince; the same character was assumed, the same policy was 
adopted, by the Italian, the Greek, or the Syrian, who ascended the 
diair of St. Peter; and, after the loss of her legions and provinces, the 
genius and fortune of the popes again restored the supremacy of Rome. 
It is agreed that in the eighth century their dominion was founded 
on rebellion, and that the rebellion was produced, and justified, by the 
heresy of the Iconoclasts; but the conduct. of the second and third 
Gregory, in this memorable contest, is variously interpreted by the 
wishes of their friends and enemies. The Byzantine writers unani- 
mously declare that, after a fruitless admonition, they pronounced 
the separation of the East and West, and deprived the sacrilegious 
tyrant of the revenue and sovereignty of Italy. Their excommunica- 
tion is still more clearly expressed by the Greeks, who beheld the ac- 
complishment of the papal triumphs; and as they are more strongly 
attached to their religion than to their country, they praise, instead 
of blaming, the zeal and orthodoxy of these apostolical men. 27 The 
modern champions of Rome are eager to accept the praise and the 
precedent: this great and glorious example of the deposition of royal 
heretics is celebrated by the cardinals Baronius and Bellarmine; ** and 
if they are asked why the same thunders were not hurled against the 
Neros and Julians of antiquity, they reply that the weakness. of the 
primitive church was the sole cause of her patient loyalty. 29 On this

Gregories.

their allegiance to Christ and his vicar (Perroniana, p. SQ).

occasion the effects of love and hatred are the same; and the zealous 
Protestants, who seek to kindle the indignation and to alarm the fears 
of princes and magistrates, expatriate on the insolence and treason of 
the two Gregories against their lawful sovereign. 30 They are de- 
fended only by the moderate Catholics, for the most part of the 
Gallican church, 31 who respect the saint without approving the sin. 
These common advocates of the crown and the mitre circumscribe the 
truth of facts by the rule of equity, Scripture, and tradition, and appeal 
to the evidence of the Latins, 82 and the lives 8S and epistles of the popes 
themselves. 

Two original epistles, from Gregory the Second to the emperor Leo, 
are still extant; 84 and if they cannot be praised as the most perfect 
models of eloquence and logic, they exhibit the portrait, or at least the 
mask, of the founder of the papal monarchy. " During ten pure and 
fortunate years," says Gregory to the emperor, " we have tasted the 
annual comfort of your royal letters, subscribed in purple ink with your 
own hand, the sacred pledges of your attachment to the orthodox creed 
of our fathers. How deplorable is the change! how tremendous the 
scandal! You now accuse the Catholics of idolatry; and, by the accu- 
sation, you betray your own impiety and ignorance. To this ignorance 
we are compelled to adapt the grossness of our style and arguments: 
the first elements of holy letters are sufficient for your confusion; and 
were you to enter a grammar-school, and avow yourself the enemy of

1351) and the vehement Spanheim (Hist. Imaginum), who, with a hundred 
more, tread in the footsteps of the centuriators of Magdeburg. 

81 See Launoy (Opera, torn. v. pars ii. Epist. vii. 7, p. 456-474), Natalis 
Alexander (Hist. Nov. Testament!, secul. viii. dissert i. p. 92-96), Pagi 
(Critica, torn. iii. p. 215, 216), and Giannone (Istoria Civile di Napoli, torn. i. 
p. 317-320), a disciple of the Gallican school. In the field of controversy 
I always pity the moderate party, who stands on the open middle ground ex- 
posed to the fire of both sides. 

88 They appeal to Paul Warnefrid, or Diaconus (de Gestis Langobard. 1. vi. 
c. 49, p. SOD, 507, in Script. Ital. Muratori, torn. i. pars, i.), and the nominal 
Anastasius (de Vit Pont, in Muratori, torn. iii. pars. I.; Gregorius II., 




and the Historia Miscella (1. xxi. p. 151, in torn. i. Script. Ital.), bothTo'f 
the ninth century, translate and approve the Greek text of Theophanes. 

38 With some minute diff erence, the most learned critics, Lucas Holstenius, 
Schelestrate, Ciampini, Bianchini, Muratori (Prolegomena ad torn. iii. pars, i), 
are agreed tiiat die Liber Pontificalis was composed and continued by the 
apostolical librarians and notaries of the eighth and ninth centuries, and that 
the last and smallest part is the work of Anastasius, whose name it bears. 
The style is barbarous, the narrative partial, the details are trifling; yet it 
must be read as a curious and authentic record of the times. The epistles 
of the popes are dispersed in the volumes of Councils. 

"The two epistles of Gregory II. have been preserved in the Acts of the 
Nicene Council (torn. viii. p. 651-674). They are without a date, which is 
variously fixed by Baronius in the year 726, by Muratori (Annali d'ltalia, 
torn. vi. p. 120) in 729, and by Pagi in 730. Such is the force of prejudice, 
that some papists have oraised the good sense and moderation of these letters.

our worship, the simple and pious children would be provoked to cast 
their horn-books at your head." After this decent salutation the pope 
attempts the usual distinction between the idols of antiquity and the 
Christian images. The former were the fanciful representations of 
phantoms or demons, at a time when the true God had not manifested 
his person in any visible likeness. The latter are the genuine forms 
of Christ, his mother, and his saints, who had approved, by a crowd 
of miracles, the innocence and merit of this relative worship. He 
must indeed have trusted to the ignorance of Leo, since he could assert 
the perpetual use of images from the apostolic age, and their venerable 
presence in the six synods of the Catholic church. A more specious 
argument is drawn from present possession and recent practice: the 
harmony of the Christian world supersedes the demand of a general 
council; and Gregory frankly confesses that such assemblies can only 
be useful under the reign of an orthodox prince. To the impudent 
and inhuman Leo, more guilty than a heretic, he recommends peace, 
silence, and implicit obedience to his spiritual guides of Constantinople 
and Rome. The limits of civil and ecclesiastical powers are defined 
by the pontiff. To the former he appropriates the body; to the latter 
the soul: the sword of justice is in the hands of the magistrate: the 
more formidable weapon of excommunication is intrusted to the clergy; 
and in the exercise of their divine commission a zealous son will not 
spare his offending father: the successor of St. Peter may lawfully 
chastise the kings of the earth. " You assault us, O tyrant 1 with a 
carnal and military hand: unarmed and naked we can only implore 
the Christ, the prince of the heavenly host, that he will send unto you 
a devil for the destruction of your body and the salvation of your 
soul. You dedare, with foolish arrogance, I will despatch my orders 
to Rome: I will break in pieces the image of St. Peter; and Gregory, 
like his predecessor Martin, shall be transported in chains and in 
exile to the foot of the imperial throne. Would to God that I might 
be permitted to tread in the footsteps of the holy Martini but may 
the fate of Constans serve as a warning to the persecutors of the church! 
After his just condemnation by the bishops of Sicily, the tyrant was 
cut off in the fulness of his sins, by a domestic servant: the saint 
is still adored by the nations of Scythia, among whom he ended his 
banishment and his life. But it is our duty to live for the edification 
and support of the faithful people; nor are we reduced to risk our 
safety on the event of a combat. Incapable as you are of defending 
.your Roman subjects, the maritime situation of the city may perhaps 
expose it to your depredation; but we can remove to the distance of 
four-and-twenty stadia to the first fortress of the Lombards, and

then you may pursue the winds. Are you ignorant that the popes 

are the bond of union, the mediators of peace between the East and 
West? The eyes of the nations are fixed on our humility; and they 
revere, as a God upon earth, the apostle St. Peter, whose image you 
threaten to destroy. 86 The remote and interior kingdoms of the West 
present their homage to Christ and his vicegerent; and we now prepare 
to visit one of their most powerful monarchs who desires to receive 
from our hands the sacrament of baptism. 87 The barbarians have sub- 
mitted to the yoke of the Gospel, while you alone are deaf to the 
voice of the shepherd. These pious barbarians are kindled into rage: 
they thirst to avenge the persecution of the East. Abandon your rash 
and fatal enterprise; reflect, tremble, and repent. If you persist, we 
are innocent of the blood that will be spilt in the contest; may it fall 
on your own head!" 

The first assault of Leo against the images of Constantinople had 
been witnessed by a crowd of strangers from Italy and the West, who 
related with grief and indignation the sacrilege of the emperor. But 
on the reception of his prescriptive edict they trembled for their 
domestic deities; the images of Christ and the Virgin, of the angels, 
martyrs, and saints, were abolished in all the churches of Italy; and a 
strong alternative was proposed to the Roman pontiff, the royal favour 
as the price of his compliance, degradation and exile as the penalty of 
his disobedience. Neither zeal nor policy allowed him to hesitate; 
and the haughty strain in which Gregory addressed the emperor dis- 
plays his confidence in the truth of his doctrine or the powers of 
resistance. Without depending on prayers or miracles, he boldly armed 
against the public enemy, and his pastoral letters admonished the 
Italians of their danger and their duty. 38 At this signal, Ravenna, 
Venice, and the cities of the Exarchate and Pentapolis adhered to the 
cause of religion; their military force by sea and land consisted, for 
the most part, of the natives; and the spirit of patriotism and zeal 
was tranfused into the mercenary strangers. The Italians swore to 
live and die in the defence of the pope and the holy images; the Roman 
people was devoted to their father, and even the Lombards were ambi- 
tious to share the merit and advantage of this holy war. The most

inquiry into the genuine measure.

treasonable act, but the most obvious revenge, was the destruction of 
the statues of Leo himself: the most effectual and pleasing measure of 
rebellion was the withholding the tribute of Italy, and depriving him 
of a power which he had recently abused by the imposition of a new 
capitation. 89 A form of administration was preserved by the election 
of magistrates and governors; and so high was the public indignation, 
that the Italians were prepared to create an orthodox emperor, and to 
conduct him with a fleet and army to the palace of Constantinople. 
In that palace the Roman bishops, the second and third Gregory, were 
condemned as the authors of the revolt, and every attempt was made, 
either by fraud or force, to seize their persons and to strike at their 
lives. The city was repeatedly visited or assaulted by captains of the 
guards, and dukes and exarchs of high dignity or secret trust; they 
landed with foreign troops, they obtained some domestic aid, and the 
superstition of Naples may blush that her fathers were attached to 
the cause of heresy. But these clandestine or open attacks were re- 
pelled by the courage and vigilance of the Romans; the Greeks were 
overthrown and massacred, their leaders suffered an ignominious death, 
and the popes, however inclined to mercy, refused to intercede for 
these guilty victims. At Ravenna, 40 the several quarters of the city 
had long exercised a bloody and hereditary feud; in religious con- 
troversy they found a new aliment of faction: but the votaries of 
images were superior in numbers or spirit, and the exarch, who at- 
tempted to stem the torrent, lost his life in a popular sedition. To 
punish this flagitious deed, and restore his dominion in Italy, the 
emperor sent a fleet and army into the Hadriatic gulf. After suffering 
from the winds and waves much loss and delay, the Greeks made their 
descent in the neighbourhood of Ravenna: they threatened to depopu- 
late the guilty capital, and to imitate, perhaps to surpass, the example 
of Justinian the Second, who had chastised a former rebellion by the 
choice and execution of fifty of the principal inhabitants. The women 
and clergy, in sackcloth and ashes, lay prostrate in prayer; the men 
were in arms for the defence of their country; the common danger had 
united the factions, and the event of a battle was preferred to the slow 
miseries of a siege. In a hard-fought day, as the two armies alternately 
yielded and advanced, a phantom was seen, a voice was heard, and 
Ravenna was victorious by the assurance of victory. The strangers 

89 A census, or capitation, says Anastasius (p. 156) : a most cruel tax, un- 
known to the Saracens themselves, exclaims the zealous Maimbourg (Hist 
des Iconoclastes, L L), and Theophanes (p. 344 [torn, i. p. 631, ed. Bonn]), 
who talks of Pharaoh's numbering the male children of Israel. This mode 
of taxation was familiar to the Saracens; and, most unluckily for the kis- 
torian, it was imposed a few years afterwards in France by his patron 
Louis XIV. 

40 See the Liber Pontificalia of Agnellus (in the Scriptores Rerum Itali- 
carum of Muratori, torn. ii, pars, i.), whose deeper shade of barbarism marks 
the difference between Rome and Ravenna. Yet we are indebted to him

retreated to their ships, but the populous sea-coast poured forth a 
multitude of boats; the waters of the Po were so deeply infected with 
blood, that during six years the public prejudice abstained from the 
fish of the river; and the institution of an annual feast perpetuated 
the worship of images and the abhorrence of the Greek tyrant. Amidst 
the triumph of the Catholic arms, the Roman pontiff convened a synod 
of ninety-three bishops against the heresy of the Iconoclasts. With 
their consent, he pronounced a general excommunication against all 
who by word or deed should attack the tradition of the fathers and 
the images of the saints: in this sentence the emperor was tacitly 
involved, 41 but the vote of a last and hopeless remonstrance may seem 
to imply that the anathema was yet suspended over his guilty head. 
No sooner had they confirmed their own safety, the worship of images, 
and the freedom of Rome and Italy, than the popes appear to have 
relaxed of their severity, and to have spared the relics of the Byzan- 
tine dominion. Their moderate counsels delayed and prevented the 
election of a new emperor, and they exhorted the Italians not to sep- 
arate from the body of the Roman monarchy. The exarch was per- 
mitted to reside within the walls of Ravenna, a captive rather than a 
master; and till the Imperial coronation of Charlemagne, the govern- 
ment of Rome and Italy was exercised in the name of the successors 
of Constantine. 42 

The liberty of Rome, which had been oppressed by the arms and 
arts of Augustus, was rescued, after seven hundred and fifty years of 
servitude, from the persecution of Leo the Isaurian. By the Caesars 
the triumphs of the consuls had been annihilated: in the decline and 
fall of the empire, the god Terminus, the sacred boundary, had in- 
sensibly receded from the ocean, the Rhine, the Danube, and the Eu- 
phrates; and Rome was reduced to her ancient territory from Viterbo 
to Terracina, and from Narni to the mouth of the Tiber. 48 When the 
kings were banished, the republic reposed on the firm basis which had 
been founded by their wisdom and virtue. Their perpetual jurisdiction 
was divided between two annual magistrates: the senate continued to

constitutes the excommunication; and the decision is of the last importance 
of their safety, since, according to the oracle (Gratian, Caus. xxiii. q. 5, c. 47, 
apud Spanheim, Hist Imag. p. 112), homicidas non esse qui excommunicates 
trucidant

The popes style Leo and Constantine Copronymus, Imperatores et Domini, 
with the strange epithet of Piissimi. A famous mosaic of the Lateran (AJD. 
798) represents Christ, who delivers the keys to St. Peter and the banner 
to Constantine V. (Muratori, Annali d'ltalia, torn. vi. p. 337).

exercise the powers of administration and counsel; and the legislative 
authority was distributed in the assemblies of the people by a well- 
proportioned scale of property and service. Ignorant of the arts of 
luxury, the primitive Romans had improved the science of government 
and war: the will of the community was absolute: the rights of indi- 
viduals were sacred: one hundred and thirty thousand citizens were 
armed for defence or conquest; and a band of robbers and outlaws was 
moulded into a nation, deserving of freedom and ambitious of glory.* 4 
When the sovereignty of the Greek emperors was extinguished, the 
ruins of Rome presented the sad image of depopulation and decay: her 
slavery was a habit, her liberty an accident; the effect of superstition, 
and the object of her own amazement and terror. The last vestige 
of the substance, or even the forms, of the constitution, was obliterated 
from the practice and memory of the Romans; and they were devoid 
of knowledge, or virtue, again to build the fabric of a commonwealth. 
Their scanty remnant, the offspring of slaves and strangers, was 
despicable in the eyes of the victorious barbarians. As often as the 
Franks or Lombards expressed their most bitter contempt of a foe, 
they called him a Roman; " and in this name," says the bishop Liut- 
prand, " we include whatever is base, whatever is cowardly, whatever is 
perfidious, the extremes of avarice and luxury, and every vice than can 
prostitute the dignity of human nature." * 5 By the necessity of their 
situation, the inhabitants of Rome were cast into the rough model of a 
republican government: they were compelled to elect some judges 
in peace and some leaders in war: the nobles assembled to deliberate, 
and their resolves could not be executed without the union and con- 
sent of the multitude. The style of the Roman senate and people was 
revived, 46 but the spirit was fled; and their new independence was 
disgraced by the tumultuous conflict of licentiousness and oppression. 
The want of laws could only be supplied by the influence of religion, 
and their foreign and domestic counsels were moderated by the author- 
ity of the bishop. His alms, his sermons, his correspondence with the 
kings and prelates of the West, his recent services, their gratitude and

oath, accustomed the Romans to consider him as the first magistrate 
or prince of the city. The Christian humility of the popes was not 
offended by the name of Dominus, or Lord; and their face and inscrip- 
tion are still apparent on the most ancient coins. 47 Their temporal 
dominion is now confirmed by the reverence of a thousand years; and 
their noblest title is the free choice of a people whom they had re- 
deemed from slavery. 

In the quarrels of ancient Greece, the holy people of Elis enjoyed 
a perpetual peace, under the protection of Jupiter, and in the exercise 
of the Olympic games. 48 Happy would it have been for the Romans 
if a similar privilege had guarded the patrimony of St. Peter from the 
calamities of war; if the Christians who visited the holy threshold 
would have sheathed their swords in the presence of the apostle and his 
successor. But this mystic circle could have been traced only by the 
want of a legislator and a sage: this pacific system was incompatible 
with the zeal and ambition of the popes: the Romans were not addicted, 
like the inhabitants of Elis, to the innocent and placid labours of 
agriculture; and the barbarians of Italy, though softened by the di- 
mate, were far below the Grecian states in the institutions of public 
and private life. A memorable example of repentance and piety was 
exhibited by Liutprand, king of the Lombards. In arms, at the gate of 
the Vatican, the conqueror listened to the voice of Gregory the Sec- 
ond, 48 withdrew his troops, resigned his conquests, respectfully visited 
the church of St. Peter, and, after performing his devotions, offered 
his sword and dagger, his cuirass and mantle, his .silver cross, and 
his crown of gold, on the tomb of the apostle. But this religious fervour 
was the illusion, perhaps the artifice, of the moment; the sense of 
interest is strong and lasting; the love of arms and rapine was con- 
genial to the Lombards; and both the prince and people were irresistibly 
tempted by the disorders of Italy, the nakedness of Rome, and the

consequently indicate the number 72. In the time of Augustus 40 gold coins 
(aure or solidi) were equal to a pound; but as these coins were gradually 
struck lighter and lighter., it was at length enacted by VaJentinian I., in A.D. 367, 
-that _ henceforth 72 solidi should be coined out of a pound of gold; and ac- 
cordingly we find CONOB for the first time on the coins of this emperor. CX S.]

unwarlike profession of her new chief. On the first edicts of the 
emperor, they declared themselves the champions of the holy images: 
Liutprand invaded the province of Romagna, which had already as- 
sumed that distinctive appellation; the Catholics of the Exarchate 
yielded without reluctance to his civil and military power; and a foreign 
enemy was introduced for the first time into the impregnable fortress 
of Ravenna. That city and fortress were speedily recovered by the 
active diligence and maritime forces of the Venetians; and those faith- 
ful subjects obeyed the exhortation of Gregory himself, in separating 
the personal guilt of Leo from the general cause of the Roman empire. 50 
The Greeks were less mindful of tike service tJm the Lombards of the 
injury: the two nations, hostile in their faith, were reconciled in a 
dangerous and unnatural alliance: the king and the exarch marched to 
the conquest of Spoleto and Rome; the storm evaporated without 
effect, but the policy of Liutprand alarmed Italy with a vexatious alter- 
native of hostility and truce. His successor Astolphus declared himself 
the equal enemy of the emperor and the pope:. Ravenna was subdued 
by force or treachery, 51 and this final conquest extinguished the series 
of the exarchs, who had reigned with a subordinate power since the 
time of Justinian and the ruin of the Gothic kingdom. Rome was sum- 
moned to acknowledge the victorious Lombard as her lawful sovereign; 
the annual tribute of a piece of gold was fixed as the ransom of each 
&lt;atizea, and the sword of destruction was unsheathed to exact the pen- 
alty of her disobedience. The Romans hesitated; they entreated; they 
complained; and the threatening barbarians were checked by arms and 
negotiations, till the popes had engaged the friendship of an ally and 
avenger beyond the Alps.* 2 

In his distress the first Gregory had implored the aid of the hero of 
the age, of Charles Martel, who governed the French monarchy with 
the humble title of mayor or duke; and who, by his signal victory over 
the Saracens, had saved his country, and perhaps Europe, from the 
Mohammedan yoke. The ambassadors of the pope were received by 
Charles with decent reverence; but the greatness of his occupations, and 
the shortness of his life, prevented his interference in the affairs of 
Italy, except fay a friendly and ineffectual mediation. His son Pepin, 
the heir of his power and virtues, assumed the office of champion of the

original and authentic MS (Bibliotheca Cubicularis} is now in the Imperial

20 THE DECLINE AND FALL OJ? 

Roman church ; and the zeal of the French prince appears to have been 
prompted by the love of glory and religion. But the danger was on 
the banks of the Tiber, the succour on those of the Seine; and our sym- 
pathy is cold to the relation of distant misery. Amidst the tears of the 
city, Stephen the Third embraced the generous resolution of visiting in 
person the courts of Lombardy and France, to deprecate the injustice 
of his enemy, or to excite the pity and indignation of his friend. After 
soothing the public despair by litanies and orations, he undertook this 
laborious journey with the ambassadors of the French monarch and the 
Greek emperor. The king of the Lombards was inexorable; but his 
threats could not silence the complaints, nor retard the speed, of the 
Roman pontiff, who traversed the Pennine Alps, reposed in the abbey 
of St. Maurice, and hastened to grasp the right hand of his protector; 
a hand which was never lifted in vain, either hi war or friendship. 
Stephen was entertained as the visible successor of the apostle; at the 
next assembly, the field of March or of May, his injuries were exposed 
to a devout and warlike nation, and he repassed the Alps, not as a sup- 
pliant, but as a conqueror, at the head of a French army, which was 
led by the king in person. The Lombards, after a weak resistance, ob- 
tained an ignominious peace, and swore to restore the possessions, 
and to respect the sanctity of the Roman church. But no sooner was 
Astolphus delivered from the presence of the French arms, than he 
forgot his promise and resented his disgrace. Rome was again encom- 
passed by his arms; and Stephen, apprehensive of fatiguing the zeal of 
his Transalpine allies, enforced his complaint and request by an elo- 
quent letter in the name and person of St. Peter himself. 58 The 
apostle assures his adoptive sons, the king, the clergy, and the nobles 
of France, that, dead in the flesh, he is still alive in the spirit; that 
they now hear, and must obey, the voice of the founder and guardian 
of the Roman church; that the Virgin, the angels, the saints, and the 
martyrs, and all the host of heaven, unanimously urge the request, 
and will confess the obligation; that riches, victory, and paradise will 
crown their pious enterprise, and that eternal damnation will be the 
penalty of their neglect, if they suffer his tomb, his temple, and his 
people to fall into the hands of the perfidious Lombards. The second 
expedition of Pepin was not less rapid and fortunate than the first: St. 
Peter was satisfied, Rome was again saved, and Astolphus was taught 
the lessons of justice and sincerity by the scourge of a foreign master. 
After this double chastisement, the Lombards languished about twenty 
years in a state of languor and decay. But their minds were not yet 
humbled to their condition; and instead of affecting the pacific virtues 
of the feeble, they peevishly harassed the Romans with a repetition of 
claims, evasions, and inroads, which they undertook without reflection 
and terminated without glory. On either side, their expiring mon-

The enemies of the popes have charged them with fraud and blasphemy; yet

archy was pressed by the zeal and prudence of Pope Adrian the First, 
the genius, the fortune, and greatness of Charlemagne the son of Pepin; 
these heroes of the church and state were united in public and domestic 
friendship, and, while they trampled on the prostrate, they varnished 
their proceedings with the fairest colours of equity and moderation." 
The passes of the Alps and the walls of Pavia were the only defence 
of the Lombards; the former were surprised, the latter were invested, 
by the son of Pepin; and after a blockade of two years, Desiderius, the 
last of their native princes, surrendered his sceptre and his capital., 
Under the dominion of a foreign king, but in .the possession of their 
national laws, the Lombards became the brethren, rather than the sub- 
jects, of the Franks; who derived their blood, and manners, and lan- 
guage from the same Germanic origin. 55 

The mutual obligations of the popes and the Carlovingian family 
form the important link of ancient and modern, of civil and ecclesi- 
astical, history. In the conquest of Italy, the champions of the Roman 
church obtained a favourable occasion, a specious title, the wishes of 
the people, the prayers and intrigues of the clergy. But the most essen- 
tial gifts of the popes to the Caxlovingian race were the dignities of 
king of France 56 and of patrician of Rome. I. Under the sacerdotal 
monarchy of St. Peter the nations began to resume the practice of 
seeking, on the banks of the Tiber, their kings, their laws, and the 
oracles of their fate. The Franks were perplexed between the name and 
substance of their government. All the powers of royalty were exer- 
cised by Pepin, mayor of the palace; and nothing, except the regal title, 
was wanting to his ambition. His enemies were crushed by his valour; 
his friends were multiplied by his liberality; his father had been the 
saviour of Christendom; and the claims of personal merit were repeated 
and ennobled in a descent of four generations. The name and image of 
royalty was still preserved in the last descendant of Clovis, the feeble 
Childeric; but his obsolete right could only be used as an instrument of 
sedition: the nation was desirous of restoring the simplicity of the con- 
stitution; and Pepin, a subject and a prince, was ambitious to ascertain 
his own rank and the fortune of his family. The mayor and the nobles

(Cod. Carolin. epist 45, p. 178, 179). Another reason against the marriage 
was the existence of a first wife (Muratori, Annali d'ltafia, torn. vi. p. 232, 
233) 236, 237). But Charlemagne indulged himself in the freedom of polygamy 
or concubinage.

"Besides the common historians, three French critics, Launoy (Opera,

were bound, by an oath of fidelity, to the royal phantom: the blood of 
Clovis was pure and sacred in their eyes; and their common ambassadors 
addressed the Roman pontiff to dispel their scruples or to absolve their 
promise. The interest of Pope Zachary, the successor of the two Greg- 
ories, prompted him to decide, and to decide in their favour: he pro- 
nounced that the nation might lawfully unite, in the same person, the 
title and authority of king; and that the unfortunate Childeric, a victim 
of the public safety, should be degraded, shaved, and confined in a mon- 
astery for the remainder of his days. An answer so agreeable to their 
wishes was accepted by the Franks, as the opinion of a casuist, the 
sentence of a judge, or the oracle of a prophet: the Merovingian race 
disappeared from the earth; and Pepin was exalted on a buckler by the 
suffrage of a free people, accustomed to obey his laws and to march 
under his standard. His coronation was twice performed, with the 
sanction of the popes, by their most faithful servant St. Boniface, the 
apostle of Germany, and by the grateful hands of Stephen the Third, 
who, in the monastery of St. Denys, placed the diadem on the head of 
his benefactor. The royal unction of the kings of Israel was dexter- 
ously applied: 07 the successor of St. Peter assumed the character of a 
divine ambassador: a German chieftain was transformed into the 
Lord's anointed; and this Jewish rite has been diffused and maintained 
by the superstition and vanity of modern Europe. The Franks were 
absolved from their ancient oath; but a dire anathema was thundered 
against them and their posterity, if they should dare to renew the same 
freedom of choice, or to elect a king, except in the holy and meritorious 
race of the Carlovingian princes. Without apprehending the future dan- 
ger, these princes gloried in their present security: the secretary of 
Charlemagne affirms that the French sceptre was transferred by the 
authority of the popes; 58 and, in their boldest enterprises, they insist, 
with confidence, on this signal and successful act of temporal jurisdiction.

make the patrician a lieutenant of the church, rather than of the empire. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 23 

required the presence of a supreme magistrate; he was indifferently 
styled the exarch or the patrician; and these governors of Ravenna, 
who fill their place in the chronology of princes, extended their juris- 
diction over the Roman city. Since the revolt of Italy and the loss of 
the Exarchate, the distress of the Romans had exacted some sacrifice 
of their independence. Yet, even in this act, they exercised the right 
of disposing of themselves; and the decrees of the senate and people 
successively invested Charles Martel and his posterity with the honours 
of patrician of Rome. The leaders of a powerful nation would have 
disdained a servile title and subordinate office; but the reign of the 
Greek emperors was suspended; and, hi the vacancy of the empire, 
they derived a more glorious commission from the pope and the repub- 
lic. The Roman ambassadors presented these patricians with the keys 
of the shrine of St. Peter, as a pledge and symbol of sovereignty; 
with a holy banner which it was their right and duty to unfurl in the 
defence of the church and the city. 60 In the time of t Charles Martel 
and of Pepin, the interposition of the Lombard kingdom covered the 
freedom, while it threatened the safety, of Rome; and the patricate 
represented only the title, the service, the alliance, of these distant 
protectors. The power and policy of Charlemagne annihilated an 
enemy and imposed a master. In his first visit to the capital he was 
received with all the honours which had formerly been paid to the 
exarch, the representative -of the emperor; and these honours obtained 
some new decorations from the joy and gratitude of Pope Adrian the 
First.* 1 No sooner was he informed of the sudden approach of the 
monarch, than he despatched the magistrates and nobles of Rome to 
meet him, with the banner, about thirty miles from the city. At the 
distance of one mile the Flaminian .Way was lined with the schools, 
or national communities, of Greeks, Lombards, Saxons, etc.: the 
Roman youth was under arms; and the children of a more tender age, 
with palms and olive branches in their hands, chanted the praises of 
their great deliverer. At the aspect of the holy crosses, and ensigns 
of the saints, he dismounted from his horse, led the procession of his 
nobles to the Vatican, and, as he ascended the stairs, devoutly kissed 
each step of the threshold of the apostles. In the portico, Adrian ex- 
pected him at the head of his clergy: they embraced, as friends and 
equals: but in their march to the altar, the king or patrician assumed 
the right hand of the pope. Nor was the Frank content with these 
vain and empty demonstrations of respect. In the twenty-six years 

w The papal advocates can soften the symbolic meaning- of the banner and 
the keys ; but the style of ad regnum dimisimus, or direximus (Codex Carolin. 
epist. i. torn. iii. pars ii. p. 76), seems to allow of no palliation or escape. In 
the MS. of the Vienna library, they read, instead of regwum, rogum, prayer 
or request (see Ducange) ; and. the royalty of Charles Martel is subverted 
by this important correction (Catalan!, in his Critical Prefaces, Annali d'ltalia, 
torn. xvii. p. 95-99). 

tt In the authentic narrative of this reception, the Liber Pontificalis observes

ti honore suscipi fecit (torn. iii. pars. i. p. 185),

that elapsed between the conquest of Lombardy and his Imperial coro- 
nation, Rome, which had been delivered by the sword, was subject, as 
his own, to the sceptre of Charlemagne. The people swore allegiance 
to his person and family: in his name money was coined and justice 
was administered; and the election of the popes was examined and 
confirmed by his authority. Except an original and self-inherent claim 
of sovereignty, there was not any prerogative remaining which the title 
of emperor could add to the patrician of Rome. 62 

The gratitude of the Carlovingians was adequate to these obligations, 
and their names are consecrated as the saviours and benefactors of 
the Roman church. Her ancient patrimony of farms and houses was 
transformed by their bounty into the temporal dominion of cities and 
provinces; and the donation of the Exarchate was the first fruit of the 
conquests of Pepin. 68 Astolphus with a sigh relinquished his prey; the 
keys and the hostages of the principal cities were delivered to the 
French ambassador; and, in his master's name, he presented them 
before the tomb of St. Peter. The ample measure of the Exarchate 64 
might comprise all the provinces of Italy which had obeyed the em- 
peror and his vicegerent; but its strict and proper limits were included 
in the territories of Ravenna, Bologna, and Ferrera: its inseparable 
dependency was the Pentapolis, which stretched along the Hadriatic 
from Rimini to Ancona, and advanced into the midland country as far 
as the ridges of the Apennine. In this transaction the ambition and 
avarice of the popes has been severely condemned. Perhaps the 
humility of a Christian priest should have rejected an earthly kingdom, 
which it was not easy for him to govern without renouncing the virtues 
of his profession. Perhaps a faithful subject, or even a generous enemy, 
would have been less impatient to divide the spoils of the barbarian; 
and if the emperor had intrusted Stephen to solicit in his name the res- 
titution of the Exarchate, I will not absolve the pope from the reproach 
of treachery and falsehood. But in the rigid interpretation of the laws, 
every one may accept, without injury, whatever his benefactor can 
bestow without injustice. The Greek emperor had abdicated or for- 
feited his right to the Exarchate; and the sword of Astolphus was 
broken by the stronger sword of the Carlovingian. It was not in the 

^Paulus Diaconus, who wrote before the empire of Charlemagne, describes 
Rome as his subject city -vestrse civitates (ad Pompeium Festum), suis ad- 
didit sceptris (de Metensis Ecclesise Episcopis). Some Carlovingian medals, 
struck at Rome, have engaged Le Blanc to write an elaborate, though partial, 
dissertation on their authority at Rome, both as patricians and emperors (Am- 
sterdam, 1692, in 4to). 

w Mosheim (Institution Hist. Eccles. p. 263) weighs this donation with fair 
and deliberate prudence. The original act has never been produced; but the 
Liber Pontificalis represents (p. 171), and the Codex Carolinus supposes, 
this ample ift Both are contemporary records; and the latter is the more 
authentic, since it has been preserved, not in the Papal, but the Imperial, 
library. * '

cause of the Iconoclast that Pepin had exposed his person and army 
in a double expedition beyond the Alps: he possessed, and might law- 
fully alienate, his conquests: and to the importunities of the Greeks he 
piously replied that no human consideration should tempt him to re- 
sume the gift which he had conferred on the Roman pontiff for the 
remission of his sins and the salvation of his soul. The splendid dona- 
tion was granted in supreme and absolute dominion, and the world 
beheld for the first time a Christian bishop invested with the preroga- 
tives of a temporal prince the choice of magistrates, the exercise of 
justice, the imposition of taxes, and the wealth of the palace of 
Ravenna. In the dissolution of the Lombard kingdom the inhabitants 
of the duchy of Spoleto 65 sought a refuge from the storm, shaved their 
heads after the Roman fashion, declared themselves the servants and 
subjects of St. Peter, and completed, by this voluntary surrender, the 
present circle of the ecclesiastical state. That mysterious circle was 
enlarged to an indefinite extent by the verbal or written donation of 
Charlemagne, 68 who, in the first transports of his victory, despoiled 
himself and the Greek emperor of the cities and islands which had 
formerly been annexed to the Exarchate. But in the cooler moments 
of absence and reflection he viewed with an eye of jealousy and envy 
the recent greatness of his ecclesiastical ally. The execution of his own 
and his father's promises was respectfully eluded: the king of the 
Franks and Lombards asserted the inalienable rights of the empire; 
and, in his life and death, Ravenna, 67 as well as Rome, was numbered 
in the list of his metropolitan cities. The sovereignty of the Exarchate 
melted away in the hands of the popes; they found in the archbishops 
of Ravenna a dangerous and domestic rival: 68 the nobles and people 
disdained the ypke of a priest; and in the disorders of the times they 
could only retain the memory of an ancient claim, which, in a more pros- 
perous age, they have revived and realised. 

Fraud is the resource of weakness and cunning; and the strong, 
though ignorant, barbarian was often entangled in the net of sacerdotal 
policy. The VaHcan and Lateran were an arsenal and manufacture 

"Spoletini deprecati stint, ut eos in servitio B. Petri reciperet et more 
Romanorum tonsurari faceret (Anastasius, p. 185). Yet it may be a question 
whether they gave their own persons or their country. 

"The policy and donations of Charlemagne are carefully examined by St 
Marc (Abrege 1 , torn. i. p. 390-408), who has well studied the Codex Carolinus. 
I believe, with him, that they were only verbal. The most ancient act of 
donation that pretends to be extant is that of the emperor Lewis the Pious 
(Sigonius, de Regno Italiae, 1. iv. Opera, torn. ii. p. 267-270). Its authen- 
ticity, or at least its integrity, are much questioned (Pagi, A.D. 817, No. 7, etc.; 
Mwatori, Annali, torn. vi. ^p. 432, etc. ; Dissertat Chorographica, p. 33, 34) ; 
but I see no reasonable objection to these princes so freely disposing of what 
was not their own. 

87 Charlemagne solicited and obtained from the proprietor, Adrian I., the 
mosaics of the palace of Ravenna, for the decoration of Aix-la-Chapelle (Cod. 
Carolin. epist. 67, p. 223). 

88 The popes often complain of the usurpations of Leo of Ravenna (Codex 
Carolin. epist 51, 52, 53, p. 200-205). Si corpus St. Andrea germani St. Petri

36 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

which, according to the occasion, have produced or concealed a various 
collection of false or genuine, of corrupt or suspicious acts, as they 
tended to promote the interest of the Roman church. Before the end 
of the eighth century some apostolical scribe, perhaps the notorious 
Isidore, composed the decretals and the donation of Constantine, the 
two magic pillars of the spiritual and temporal monarchy of the popes. 
This memorable donation was introduced to the world by an epistle of 
Adrian the First, who exhorts Charlemagne to imitate the liberality 
and revive the name of the great Constantine. 60 According to the 
legend, the first of the Christian emperors was healed of the leprosy, 
and purified in the waters of baptism, by St. Silvester, the Roman 
bishop; and never was physician more gloriously recompensed. His 
royal proselyte withdrew from the seat and patrimony of St. Peter; 
declared his resolution of founding a new capital in the East; and 
resigned to the popes the free and perpetual sovereignty of Rome, Italy, 
and the provinces of the West. 70 This fiction was productive of the 
most beneficial effects. The Greek princes were convicted of the guilt 
of usurpation; and the revolt of Gregory was the claim of his lawful 
inheritance. The popes were delivered from their debt of gratitude; 
and the nominal gifts of the Carlovingians were no more than the just 
gnd irrevocable restitution of a scanty portion of the ecclesiastical state. 
The sovereignty of Rome no longer depended on the choice of a fickle 
people; and the successors of St. Peter and Constantine were invested 
with the purple and prerogatives of the Caesars. So deep was the 
ignorance and credulity of the times that the most absurd of fables 
was received with equal reverence in Greece and in France, and is still 
enrolled among the decrees of the Canon law. 71 The emperors and 
the Romans were incapable of discerning a forgery that subverted their 
rights and freedom; and the only opposition proceeded from a Sabine 
monastery, which in the beginning of the twelfth century disputed the 
truth and validity of the donation of Constantine. 72 In the revival of 

*Piissimo Constantino magno, per ejus largitatem S. R. Ecclesia elevata et 
exaltata est, et potestatem in his Hesperiae partibus largiri dignatus est . . . 
Quia ecce novus Constantinus his temppribus, etc. (Codex Carolin. epist. 40, 
in torn, ill part. ii. p. 195)- Pa&amp;i (Critica, A.D. 324, No. 16) ascribes them to 
an imposter of the eighth centuryj who borrowed the name of St. Isidore: 
his humble title of Peccator was ignorantly, but aptly, turned into M creator ; 
his merchandise was indeed profitable, and a few sheets of paper were sold 
for much wealth and power. 

TO Fabricius (Biblioth.. Gnec. torn, vi. p. 4-7) has enumerated the several 
editions of this Act, in Greek and Latin. The copy which Laurentius Valla 
recites and refutes appears to be taken either from the spurious Acts of 
St. Silvester or from Gratian's Decree, to which, according to him and others, 
it has been surreptitiously tacked 

71 In the year 1059, it was believed (was it believed?) by Pope Leo IX., 
Cardinal Peter Damianus, etc. Muratori places (Annali d'ltalia, torn. ix. p. 23,

letters and liberty this fictitious deed was transpierced by the pen of 
Laurentius Valla, the pen of an eloquent critic and a Roman patriot. 
His contemporaries of the fifteenth century were astonished at his 
sacrilegious boldness; yet such is the silent and irresistible progress of 
reason, that before the end of the next age the fable was rejected by 
the contempt of historians T4 and poets, 76 and the tacit or modest 
censure of the advocates of the Roman church. 76 The popes themselves 
have indulged a smile at the credulity of the vulgar; 7T but a false 
and obsolete title still sanctifies their reign; and by the same fortune 
which has attended the decretals and the Sibylline oracles, the edifice 
has subsisted after the foundations have been undermined. 

While the popes established in Italy their freedom and dominion, 
the images-, the first cause of their revolt, were restored in the Eastern 
empire. 78 Under the reign of Constantine the Fifth, the union of civil

Mabillon), and would have enriched the first volume of the Histpria Monas- 
tica Italiae of Quirini. But they are now imprisoned (Muratori, Scriptores 
R. I. torn. ii. pars. ii. p. 269) by the timid policy of the court of Rome; and 
the future cardinal yielded to the voice of authority and the whispers of am* 
bition (Quirini, Comment pars. ii. p. 123-136). 

78 1 have read in the collection of Schardius (de Potestate Imperials Ec- 
clesiastica, p. 734-7o) this animated discourse, which was composed by the 
author A.D. 1440, six years after the flight of Pope Eugenius IV. It is a 
most vehement party pamphlet; Valla justifies and animates the revolt of the 
Romans, and would even approve the use of a dagger against their sacerdotal 
tyrant. Such a critic might expect the persecution of the clergy; yet he made 
his peace, and is buried in the Lateran (Bayle, Dictionnaire Critique, VALLA; 
Vossius, de Historicis Latinis, p. 580). 

74 See Guicciardini, a servant of the popes, in that long and valuable digres- 
sion, which has resumed its place in the last edition, correctly published from 
the author's MS., and printed in four volumes in quarto, under the name of 
Friburgo, 1775 (Istoria d'ltalia, torn. i. p. 385-395)-

Questo era il^dono (se per6 dir lece)

Yet this incomparable poem has been approved by a bull of Leo X. 

TO See Baronius, A.D. 324, No. 117-123; AJX 1191, No. 51, etc. The cardinal 
wishes to suppose that Rome was offered by Constantine, and refused by- 
Silvester. The act of donation he considers, strangely enough, as a forgery 
of the Greeks. 

"Baronius n'en dit gueres centre; encore en a-t-il trop dit, et Ton vouloit

and ecclesiastical power had overthrown the tree, without extirpating 
the root, of superstition. The idols, for such they were now held, 
were secretly cherished by the order and the sex most prone to devo- 
tion; and the fond alliance of the monks and females obtained a final 
victory over the reason and authority of man. Leo the Fourth main- 
tained with less rigour the religion of his father and grandfather; but 
his wife, the fair and ambitious Irene, had imbibed the zeal of the 
Athenians, the heirs of the idolatry, rather than the philosophy, of their 
ancestors. During the life of her husband these sentiments were in- 
flamed by danger and dissimulation, and she could only labour to 
protect and promote some favourite monks whom she drew from their 
caverns and seated on the metropolitan thrones of the East. But as 
soon as she reigned in her own name and that of her son, Irene more 
seriously undertook the ruin of the Iconoclasts; and the first step of 
her future persecution was a general edict for liberty of conscience. 
In the restoration of the monks a thousand images were exposed to 
the public veneration; a thousand legends were invented of their suffer- 
ings and miracles. By the opportunities of death or removal the 
episcopal seats were judiciously filled; the most eager competitors for 
earthly or celestial favour anticipated and flattered the judgment of 
their sovereign; and the promotion of her secretary Tarasius gave Irene 
the patriarch of Constantinople, and the command of the Oriental 
church. But the decrees of a general council could only be repealed 
by a similar assembly: T9 the Iconoclasts whom she convened were bold 
in possession, and averse to debate; and the feeble voice of the bishops 
was re-echoed by the more formidable clamour of the soldiers and 
people of Constantinople. The delay and intrigues of a year, the 
separation of the disaffected troops, and the choice of Nice for a second 
orthodox synod, removed these obstacles; and the episcopal conscience 
was again, after the Greek fashion, in the hands of the prince. No 
more than eighteen days were allowed for the consummation of this 
important work: the Iconoclasts appeared, not as judges, but as crim- 
inals or penitents: the scene was decorated by the legates of Pope 
Adrian and the Eastern patriarchs; 80 the decrees were framed by the 
president Tarasius, and ratified by the acclamations and subscriptions 
of three hundred and fifty bishops. They unanimously pronounced 
that the worship of images is agreeable to Scripture and reason, to the 
fathers and councils of the church: but they hesitate whether that 
worship be relative or direct; whether the godhead and the figure of 

monks; and even Le Beau (Hist du Bas Empire), a gentleman and a scholar, 
is infected by the odious contagion. 

w See the Acts, in Greek and Latin, of the second Council of Nice, with a 
number of relative pieces, in the eighth volume of the Councils, p. 645-1600. 
A faithful version, with some critical notes, would provoke, in different readers, 
a sigh or a smile. 

80 The pope's legates were casual messengers, two priests without any special 
commission, and who were disavowed on their return. Some vagabond monks 
were persuaded by the Catholics to represent the Oriental patriarchs. This 
curious anecdote is revealed by Theodore Studites (Epist. i. 38, in Sirmond. 
Opp. torn. v. p. 1319), one of the warmest Iconoclasts of the age. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 29 

Christ be entitled to the same mode of adoration. Of this second 
Nicene council the acts are still extant; a curious monument of super- 
stition and ignorance, of falsehood and folly. I shall only notice the 
judgment of the bishops, on the comparative merit of image-worship 
and morality. A monk had concluded a truce with the demon of 
fornication, on condition of interrupting his daily prayers to a picture 
that hung in his cell. His scruples prompted him to consult the abbot. 
" Rather than abstain from adoring Christ and his Mother in their holy 
images, it would be better for you," replied the casuist, " to enter every 
brothel, and visit every prostitute, in the city." 81 For the honour of 
orthodoxy, at least the orthodoxy of the Roman church, it is somewhat 
unfortunate that the two princes who convened the two councils of 
Nice are both stained with the blood of their sons. The second of 
these assemblies was approved and rigorously executed by the despot- 
ism of Irene, and she refused her adversaries the toleration which at 
first she had granted to her friends. During the five succeeding reigns, 
a period of thirty-eight years, the contest was maintained with unabated 
rage and various success between the worshippers and the breakers of 
the images; but I am not inclined to pursue with minute diligence the 
repetition of the same events. Nicephorus allowed a general liberty of 
speech and practice; and the only virtue of his reign is accused by the 
monks as the cause of his temporal and eternal perdition. Superstition 
and weakness formed the character of Michael the First, but the saints 
and images were incapable of supporting their votary on the throne. 
In the purple, Leo the Fifth asserted the name and religion of an 
Armenian; and the idols, with their seditious adherents, were con- 
demned to a second exile. Their applause would have sanctified the 
murder of an impious tyrant, but his assassin and successor, the second 
Michael, was tainted from his birth with the Phrygian heresies: he 
attempted to mediate between the contending parties; and the intrac- 
table spirit of the Catholics insensibly cast him into the opposite scale. 
His moderation was guarded by timidity; but his son Theophilus 
alike ignorant of fear and pity, was the last and most cruel of the 
Iconoclasts. The enthusiasm of the times ran strongly against them; 
and the emperors, who stemmed the torrent, were exasperated and 
punished by the public hatred. After the death of Theophilus the final 
victory of the images was achieved by a second female, his widow 
Theodora, whom he left the guardian of the empire. Her measures 
were bold and decisive. The fiction of a tardy repentance absolved the 
fame and the soul of her deceased husband; the sentence of the Icono- 
clast patriarch was commuted from the loss of his eyes to a whipping 
of two hundred lashes: the bishops trembled, the monks shouted, and 
the festival of orthodoxy preserves the annual memory of the triumph 
of the images. A single question yet remained, whether they are

endowed with any proper and inherent sanctity; it was agitated by the 
Greeks of the eleventh century; 82 and as this opinion has the strongest 
recommendation of absurdity, I am surprised that it was not more 
explicitly decided in the affirmative. In the West Pope Adrian the 
First accepted and announced the decrees of the Nicene assembly, 
which is now revered by the Catholics as the seventh in rank of the 
.general councils. Rome and Italy were docile to the voice of their 
father; but the greatest part of the Latin Christians were far behind 
hi the race of superstition. The churches of France, Germany, Eng- 
land, and Spain steered a middle course between the adoration and 
the destruction of images, which they admitted into their temples, not 
.as objects of worship, but as lively and useful memorials of faith and 
history. An angry book of controversy was composed and published 
in the name of Charlemagne: 83 under his authority a synod of three 
hundred bishops was assembled at Frankfort: 84 they blamed the fury 
of the Iconoclasts, but they pronounced a more severe censure against 
the superstition of the Greeks, and the decrees of their pretended coun- 
cil, which was long despised by the barbarians of the West. 88 Among 
them the worship of images advanced with a silent and insensible 
progress; but a large atonement is made for their hesitation and delay 
by the gross idolatry of the ages which precede the reformation, and 
of the countries, both in Europe and America, which are still immersed 
in the gloom of superstition. 

It was after the Nicene synod, and under the reign of the pious 
Irene, that the popes consummated the separation of Rome and Italy, 
ty the translation of the empire to the less orthodox Charlemagne. 
They were compelled to choose between the rival nations: religion was 
not the sole motive of their choice; and while they dissembled the fail- 
ings of their friends, they beheld, with reluctance and suspicion, the

84 The assemblies of Charlemagne were political as well as ecclesiastical; 
and the three hundred members (Nat. Alexander, sect. viii. p. 53) who sat 
-and voted at Frankfort must include not only the bishops, but the abbots 
and even the principal laymen.

Catholic virtues of their foes. The difference of language and manners 
had perpetuated the enmity of the two capitals; and they were alien- 
ated from each other by the hostile opposition of seventy years. In 
that schism the Romans had tasted of freedom, and the popes of sov- 
ereignty: their submission would have exposed them to the revenge of 
a jealous tyrant; and the revolution of Italy had betrayed the impo- 
tence, as well as the* tyranny, of the Byzantine court. The Greek 
emperors had restored the images, but they had not restored the- 
Calabrian estates 86 and the Ulyrian diocese, 87 which the Iconoclasts 
had torn away from the successors of St. Peter; and Pope Adrian 
threatens them with a sentence of excommunication unless they speed- 
ily abjure this practical heresy. 88 The Greeks were now orthodox; but 
their religion might be tainted by the breath of the reigning monarch: 
the Franks were now contumacious; but a discerning eye might discern 
their approaching conversion, from the use, to the adoration, of images. 
The name of Charlemagne was stained by the polemic acrimony of his 
scribes; but the conqueror himself conformed, with the temper of a 
statesman, to the various practices of France and Italy. In his four 
pilgrimages or visits to the Vatican he embraced the popes in the com- 
munion of friendship and piety; knelt before the tomb, and conse- 
quently before the image, of the apostle; and joined, without scruple, 
in all the prayers and processions of the Roman liturgy. Would pru- 
dence or gratitude allow the pontiffs to renounce their benefactor? 
Had they a right to alienate his gift of the Exarchate? Had they 
power to abolish his government of Rome? The title of patrician was- 
below the merit and greatness of Charlemagne; and it was only by 
reviving the Western empire that they could pay their obligations 
or secure their establishment. By this decisive measure they would 
finally eradicate the claims of the Greeks: from the debasement of a 
provincial town, the majesty of Rome would be restored; the Latin 
Christians would be united, under a supreme head, in their ancient

and Calabria, which yielded an annual rent of three talents and a half of 
gold (perhaps 7000 sterling). Liutprand more pompously enumerates the 
patrimonies of the Roman church in Greece, Judaea, Persia, Mesopotamia 
Babylonia, Egypt, and Libya, which were detained by the injustice of the 
Greek emperor (Legat ad Nicephorum, in Script. Rerum Italicarum, torn, ii 
pars. i. p. 481).

of the Greeks, the patriarch of Constantinople had detached from Rome the 
metropolitans of Thessalonica, Athens, Corinth^ Nicopolis, and Patrae (Luc, 
Holsten. Geograph. Sacra, p. 22) ; and his spiritual conquests extended to 
Naples and Amalfi (Giannone, Istoria Civile di Napoli, torn. i. p. 517-524; 
Pagi, A.D. 730, No. n).

metropolis; and the conquerors of the West would receive their crown 
from the successors of St. Peter. The Roman church would acquire 
a zealous and respectable advocate; and, under the shadow of the 
Carlovingian power, the bishop might exercise, with honour and safety, 
the government of the city. 89 

Before the ruin of Paganism in Rome the competition for a wealthy 
bishopric had often been productive of tumult and bloodshed. The 
people was less numerous, but the times were more savage, the prize 
more important, and the chair of St. Peter was fiercely disputed by the 
leading ecclesiastics who aspired to the rank of sovereign. The reign 
of Adrian the First 00 surpasses the measure of past or succeeding 
ages; 91 the walls of Rome, the sacred patrimony, the ruin of the 
Lombards, and the friendship of Charlemagne, were the trophies of his 
fame: he secretly edified the throne of his successors, and displayed in 
a narrow space the virtues of a great prince. His memory was revered; 
but in the next election, a priest of the Lateran, Leo the Third, was 
preferred to the nephew and the favourite of Adrian, whom he had 
promoted to the first dignities of the church. Their acquiescence or 
repentance disguised, above four years, the blackest intention of re- 
venge, till the day of a procession, when a furious band of conspirators 
dispersed the unarmed multitude, and assaulted with blows and wounds 
the sacred person of the pope. But their enterprise on his life or lib- 
erty was disappointed, perhaps by their own confusion and remorse. 
Leo was left for dead on the ground: on his revival from the swoon, 
the effect of his loss of blood, he recovered his speech and sight; and 
this natural event was improved to the miraculous restoration of his 
eyes and tongue, of which he had been deprived, twice deprived, by 
the knife of assassins. 92 From his prison he escaped to the Vatican: 

^Fontanini considers the emperors as no more than the advocates of the 
church (advocatus et defensor S. R. E. See Ducange, Gloss. Lat. torn. i. 
p. 97). His antagonist Muratori reduces the popes to be no more than the 
exarchs of the emperor. In the more equitable view of Mosheim (Institut. 
Hist. Eccles. p. 264, 265), they held Rome under the empire as the most hon- 
ourable species of fief or benefice premuntur nocte caliginosa! 

90 His merits and hopes are summed up in an epitaph of thirty-eight verses, 
of which Charlemagne declares himself the author (Concil. torn. viii. p. 520). 

Post patrem lacrymans Carolus haec carmina scripsi. 
Tu inihi dulcis amor, te modo plango pater . . . 
Nomina jungo simul titulis, clarissime, nostra 
Adrianus, Carolus, rex ego, tuque pater. 

The poetry might be supplied by Alcuin; but the tears, the most glorious 
tribute, can only belong to Charlemagne. 

* Every new pope is admonished -"Sancte Pater, non videbis annos Petri," 
twenty-five years. On the whole series the average is about eight years a 
short hope for an ambitious cardinal. 

M The assurance of Anastasius (torn. iii. pars i. p. 197, 198) is supported 
by the credulity of some French annalists; but Eginhard, and other writers 
of the same age, are more natural and sincere. 7 'Unus ei oculus paululum 
est laesus," says John the deacon of Naples (Vit. Episcop. Napol. in Scriptores 
Muratori, torn. i. pars ii. p. 312). Theodolphus, a contemporary bishop of 
Orleans, observes with prudence (1. iii.-carm. 3) : 

Reddita sunt? mirum est: mirum est auferre nequisse. 
Est tamen in dubio. hinc mirer an inde magis. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 33 

the duke of Spoleto hastened to his rescue, Charlemagne sympathised 
in his injury, and in his camp of Paderborn in Westphalia accepted, 
or solicited, a visit from the Roman pontiff. Leo repassed the Alps 
with a commission of counts and bishops, the guards of his safety 
and the judges of his innocence; and it was not without reluctance that 
the conqueror of the Saxons delayed till the ensuing year the personal 
discharge of this pious office. In his fourth and last pilgrimage he was 
received at Rome with the due honours of king and patrician: Leo 
was permitted to purge himself by oath of the crimes imputed to his 
charge: his enemies were silenced, and the sacrilegious attempt against 
his life was punished by the mild and insufficient penalty of exile. 
On the festival of Christmas, the last year of the eighth century, 
Charlemagne appeared in the church of St. Peter, and, to gratify the 
vanity of Rome, he had exchanged the simple dress of his country 
for the habit of a patrician. 05 After the celebration of the holy 
mysteries, Leo suddenly placed a precious crown on his head, 94 and 
the dome resounded with the acclamations of the people, " Long life 
and victory to Charles, the most pious Augustus, crowned by God 
the great and pacific emperor of the Romans!" The head and body of 
Charlemagne were consecrated by the royal unction: after the example 
of the Caesars, he was saluted or adored by the pontiff: his corona- 
tion oath represents a promise to maintain the faith and privileges 
of the church; and the first fruits were paid in his rich offerings to the 
shrine of the apostle. In his familiar conversation the emperor pro- 
tested his ignorance of the intentions of Leo, which he would have 
disappointed by his absence on that memorable day. But the prepara- 
tions of the ceremony must have disclosed the secret; and the journey 
of Charlemagne reveals his knowledge and expectation: he had 
acknowledged that the Imperial title was the object of his ambition, 
and a Roman synod had pronounced that it was the only adequate 
reward of his merit and services. 95 

The appellation of great has been often bestowed, and sometimes 
deserved, but CHARLEMAGNE is the only prince in whose favour the title 

88 Twice, at the request of Adrian and Leo, he appeared at Rome longzi 
tunica et chlamyde amictus, et calceamentis quoque Romano more formatis. 
Eginhard (c. xxiii. p. 109-113) describes, like Suetonius, the simplicity of 
his dress, so popular in the nation, that, when Charles the Bald returned to 
France in a foreign habit, the patriotic dogs barked at the apostate (Gaillard, 
Vie de Charlemagne, torn. iv. p. 109). 

M See Anastasius (p. 199) and Eginhard (c. xxviii. p. 124-128). The unction 
is mentioned by Theophanes (p. 399 [torn. i. p. 733, ed. Bonn]), the oath by 
Sigonius (from the Ordo Romanus), and the pope's adoration, more anti- 
quorum principum, by the Annales Bertiniam (Script Murator. torn. ii. 
pars ii. p. 505). 

95 This great event of the translation or restoration of the empire is related 
and discussed by Natalis Alexander (secul. ix. dissert L p. 390-397), Pagi 
(torn. iii. p. 418), Muratori (Annali d'ltalia, torn. vi. p. 339-35^), Sigonius 
de Regno Italise, 1. iv. Opp. torn. ii. p. 247-251), Spanheim (de ficta Trans- 
latione Imperii), Giannone (torn. i. p.. 395-405), St Marc (Abregd Chrono- 
logique, torn. i. p. 438-450), Gaillard (Hist de Charlemagne, torn. ii. p. 386- 
446). Almost all these moderns have some relict ous or national bias. 



34 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

has been indissolubly blended with the name. That name, with the 
addition of saint, is inserted in the Roman calendar; and the saint, by 
a rare felicity, is crowned with the praises of the historians and philos- 
ophers of an enlightened age. ea His real merit is doubtless enhanced 
by the barbarism of the nation and the times from which he emerged: 
but the apparent magnitude of an object is likewise enlarged by an 
unequal comparison; and the ruins of Palmyra derive a casual splendour 
from the nakedness of the surrounding desert. Without injustice to his 
fame, I may discern some blemishes in the sanctity and greatness of 
the restorer of the Western empire. Of his moral virtues, chastity 
is not the most conspicuous: 97 but the public happiness could not be 
materially injured by his nine wives or concubines, the various indul- 
gence of meaner or more transient amours, the multitude of his bas- 
tards whom he bestowed on the church, and the long celibacy and 
licentious manners of his daughters, 88 wnom the father was suspected 
of loving with too fond a passion. I shall be scarcely permitted to 
accuse the ambition of a conqueror; but in a day of equal retribution, 
the sons of his brother Carloman, the Merovingian princes of Aquitain, 
and the four thousand five hundred Saxons who were beheaded on the 
same spot, would have something to allege against the justice and 
humanity of Charlemagne. His treatment of the vanquished Saxons 
was an abuse of the right of conquest; his laws were not less san- 
guinary than his arms, and, in the discussion of his motives, whatever 
is subtracted from bigotry must be imputed to temper. The sedentary 
reader is amazed by his incessant activity of mind and body; and his 
subjects and enemies were not less astonished at his sudden presence 
at the moment when they believed him at the most distant extremity 
of the empire; neither peace nor war, nor summer nor winter, were a 
season of repose; and our fancy cannot easily reconcile the annals of 

w By Mably (Observations sur THistoire de France), Voltaire (Histoire 
G6n6rale), Robertson (History of Charles V.), and Montesquieu (Esprit des 
Loix, L xxxi. c. 18). In the year 1782 M. Gaillard published his Histoire 
de Charlemagne (in 4 vols. in I2mo), which I have freely and profitably 
used. The author is a man of sense and humanity, and his work is laboured 
with industry and elegance. But I have likewise examined the original monu- 
ments of the reigns of Pepin and Charlemagne, in the fifth volume of the 
Historians of France. 

^The vision of Weltin, composed by a monk eleven years after the death 
of Charlemagne, shows him in purgatory, with a vulture, who is perpetually 
gnawing the guilty member, while the rest of his body, the emblem of his 
virtues, is sound and perfect (see Gaillard, torn. ii. p. 317-360). 

1)8 The marriage of Eginhard with Imma, daughter of Charlemagne, is, in 
my opinion, sufficiently refuted by the probrum and suspicio that sullied these 
fair damsels, without excepting his own wife (c. xix. p. 98-100, cum Notis 
Schmincke). The husband must have been too strong for the historian. 

* Besides the massacres and transmigrations, the pain of death was pro- 
nounced against the following crimes: i. The refusal of baptism. 2. The 
f alse pretence of baptism. 3. A relapse to idolatry. 4. The murder of a priest 
or bishop. 5. Human 'sacrifices. 6. Eating meat in Lent. But every crime 
might be expiated by baptism or penance (Gaillard, torn. ii. p. 241-247) ; and 
the Christian Saxons became the friends and equals of the Franks (Struv. 
Corpus Hist Germanicse, p. 133). 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 35 

his reign with the geography of his expeditions. 100 But this activity 
was a national, rather than a personal virtue: the vagrant life of 
a Frank was spent in the 'chase, in pilgrimage, in military adventures; 
and the journeys of Charlemagne were distinguished only by a more 
numerous train and a more important purpose. His military renown 
must be tried by the scrutiny of his troops, his enemies, and his 
actions. Alexander conquered with the arms of Philip, but the two 
heroes who preceded Charlemagne bequeathed him their name, their 
examples, and the companions of their victories. At the head of his 
veteran and superior armies he oppressed the savage or degenerate 
nations, who were incapable of confederating for their common safety; 
nor did he ever encounter an equal antagonist in numbers, in discipline, 
or in arms. The science of war has been lost and revived with the 
arts of peace; but his campaigns are not illustrated by any siege or 
battle of singular difficulty and success; and he might behold with 
envy the Saracen trophies of his grandfather. After his Spanish expe- 
dition his rear-guard was defeated in the Pyrenaean mountains; and 
the soldiers, whose situation was irretrievable, and whose valour was 
useless, might accuse, with their last breath, the want of skill or 
caution of their general- 101 I touch with reverence the laws of Charle- 
magne, so highly applauded by a respectable judge. They compose 
not a system, but a series, of occasional and minute edicts, for the 
correction of abuses, the reformation of manners, the economy of his 
farms, the care of his poultry, and even the sale of his eggs. He wished 
to improve the laws and the character of the Franks; and his attempts, 
however feeble and imperfect, are deserving of praise: the inveterate 
evils of the times were suspended or mollified by his government; 102 
but in his institutions I can seldom discover the general views and the 
immortal spirit of a legislator, who survives himself for the benefit of 
posterity. The union and stability of his empire depended on the life 
of a single man: he imitated the dangerous practice of dividing his 
kingdoms among his sons; and, after his numerous diets, the whole 
constitution was left to fluctuate between the disorders of anarchy

statement of Charlemagne's military campaigns, viz. :

in an ingenious Supplement of M. Gaillard (torn. iii. p. 474). The Spaniards 
are too proud of a victory which history ascribes to the Gascons, and romance 
to the Saracens.

and oppression of his reign (Hist, des Allemands, torn. ii. p. 45-49).

and despotism. His esteem for the piety and knowledge of the clergy 
tempted him to intrust that aspiring order with temporal dominion 
and civil jurisdiction; and his son Lewis, when he was stripped and 
degraded by the bishops, might accuse, in some measure, the impru- 
dence of his father. His laws enforced the imposition of tithes, because 
the demons had proclaimed in the air that the default of payment 
had been the cause of the last scarcity. 103 The literary merits of 
Charlemagne are attested by the foundation of schools, the introduc- 
tion of arts, the works which were published in his name, and his 
familiar connection with the subjects and strangers whom he invited 
to his court to educate both the prince and people. His own studies 
were tardy, laborious, and imperfect; if he spoke Latin, and under- 
stood Greek, he derived the rudiments of knowledge from conversa- 
tion, rather than from books; and, in his mature age, the emperor 
strove to acquire the practice of writing, which every peasant now 
learns in his infancy. 104 The grammar and logic, the music and astron- 
omy, of the times were Only cultivated as the handmaids of supersti- 
tion; but the curiosity of the human mind must ultimately tend to its 
improvement, and the encouragement of learning reflects the purest and 
most pleasing lustre on the character of Charlemagne. 105 The dignity 
of his person, 106 the length of his reign, the prosperity of his arms, 
the vigour of his government, and the reverence of distant nations' 
distinguish him from the royal crowd; and Europe dates a new era 
from his restoration of the Western empire. 
That empire was not unworthy of its title, 107 and some of the fairest

Such is the decree and assertion of the great Council of Frankfort (Canon 
xxv. torn. ix. p. 105). Both Selden (Hist, of Tithes; Works, vol. iii. part ii 
p. 1146) and Montesquieu (Esprit des Loix, 1. xxxi. c. 12) represent Charle- 
magne as the first legal author of tithes. Such obligations have country gentle- 
men to his memory! 

104 Eginhard (c. 25, p. 119) clearly affirms, tentabat et scribere . . . sed 
parum prospere successit labor praeposterus et sero inchoatus. The moderns 
have perverted and corrected this obvious meaning, and the title of M. Gail- 
lard's Dissertation (torn. iii. p. 247-260) betrays his partiality.

THE ROMAN EMPIRE 3? 

kingdoms of Europe were the patrimony or conquest of a prince who 
reigned at the same time in France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Hun- 
gary. 108 I. The Roman province of Gaul had been transformed into 
the name and monarchy of FKANCE: but, in the decay of the Mero- 
vingian line, its limits were contracted by the independence of the 
Britons and the revolt of Aqmtam. Charlemagne pursued and con- 
fined the Britons on the shores of the ocean; and that ferocious tribe, 
whose origin and language are so different from the French, was chas- 
tised by the imposition of tribute, hostages, and peace. After a long 
and evasive contest, the rebellion of the dukes of Aquitain was pun- 
ished by the forfeiture of their province, their liberty, and their lives. 
Harsh and rigorous would have been such treatment of ambitious 
governors, who had too faithfully copied the mayors of the palace. 
But a recent discovery 109 has proved that these unhappy princes were 
the last and lawful heirs of the blood and sceptre of Clovis, a younger 
branch, from the brother of Dagobert, of the Merovingian house. Their 
ancient kingdom was reduced to the duchy of Gascogne, to the counties 
of Fesenzac and Armagnac, at the foot of the Pyrenees: their race 
was propagated till the beginning of the sixteenth century, and, after 
surviving their Carlovingian tyrants, they were reserved to feel the 
injustice or the favours of a third dynasty. By the re-union of Aqui- 
tain, France was enlarged to its present boundaries, with the additions 
of the Netherlands and Spain, as far as the Rhine. II. The Saracens 
had been expelled from France by the grandfather and father of 
Charlemagne; but they still possessed the greatest part of SPAIN, from 
the rock of Gibraltar to the Pyrenees. Amidst their civil divisions, an 
Arabian emir of Saragossa implored his protection in the diet of Pader- 
born. Charlemagne undertook the expedition, restored the emir, and, 
without distinction of faith, impartially crushed the resistance of the 
Christians, and rewarded the obedience and service of the Mohamme- 
dans. In his absence he instituted the Spanish march* 1 * which ex-

100 Of a charter granted to the monastery of Alaon (A.D. 845) by Charles 
the Bald, which deduces this royal pedigree. I doubt whether some subsequent 
links of the ninth and tenth centuries are equally firm; yet the whole is ap- 
proved and defended by M. Gaillard (torn. ii. p. 60^81, 203-206), who affirms 
that the family of Montesquieo (not of the President de Montesquieu) is 
descended, in the female line, from Clotaire and Clovis an innocent pre- 
tension 1 

^The governors or counts of the Spanish march revolted from Charles 
the Simple about the year 900; and a poor pittance, the Rousillon, has been 
recovered in 1642 by the kings of France (Longuerue, Description de la 
France, torn. i. p. 220-222). Yet the Rousillon contains 188,900 subjects, and 
annually pays 2,600,000 livres (Necker, Administration des Finances, torn. i. 
p. 278, 279) ; more people, perhaps, and doubtless more money, than the march 
of Charlemagne.

tended from the Pyrenees to the river Ebro: Barcelona was the resi- 
dence of the French governor; he possessed the counties of Rousillon 
and Catalonia, and the infant kingdoms of Navarre and Arragon were 
subject to his jurisdiction. III. As king of the Lombards and patrician 
of Rome he reigned over the greatest part of ITALY, UI a tract of a thou- 
sand miles from the Alps to the borders of Calabria. The duchy of 
Beneventum, a Lombard fief, had spread, at the expense of the Greeks, 
over the modern kingdom of Naples. But Arrechis, the reigning duke, 
refused to be included in the slavery of his country, assumed the inde- 
pendent title of prince, and opposed his sword to the Carlovingian 
monarchy. His defence was firm, his submission was not inglorious, and 
the emperor was content with an easy tribute, the demolition of his 
fortresses, and the acknowledgment, on his coins, of a supreme lord. 
The artful flattery of his son Grimoald added the appellation of father, 
but he asserted his dignity with prudence, and Beneventum insensibly 
escaped from the French yoke. 112 IV. Charlemagne was the first who 
united GERMANY under the same sceptre. The name of Oriental France 
is preserved in the circle of Franconia; and the people of Hesse and 
Thwingia were recently incorporated with the victors by the conform- 
ity of religion and government. The Alemanni, so formidable to the 
Romans, were the faithful vassals and confederates of the Franks, and 
their country was inscribed within the modern limits of Alsace, Swabia, 
and Switzerland. The Bavarians, with a similar indulgence of their 
laws and manners, were less patient of a master: the repeated treasons 
of Tasillo justified the abolition of their hereditary dukes, and their 
power was shared among the counts who judged and guarded that 
important frontier. But the north of Germany, from the Rhine and 
beyond the Elbe, was still hostile and Pagan; nor was it till after 
a war of thirty-three years that the Saxons bowed under the yoke 
of Christ and of Charlemagne* The idols and their votaries were 
extirpated; the foundation of eight bishoprics, of Munster, Osna- 
burgh, Paderborn, and Minden, of Bremen, Verden, Hildesheim, and 
Halberstadt, define, on either side of the Weser, the bounds of ancient 
Saxony; these episcopal seats were the first schools and cities of that 
savage land, and the religion and humanity of the children atoned, in 
some degree, for the massacre of the parents. Beyond the Elbe, the 
Slam, or Sclavonians, of similar manners and various denominations, 
overspread the modern dominions of Prussia, Poland, and Bohemia, and 
some transient marks of obedience have tempted the French historian 
tc extend the empire to the Baltic and the Vistula. The conquest or 
conversion of those countries is of a more recent age, but the first 
union of Bohemia with the Germanic body may be justly ascribed to 
the arms of Charlemagne. V. He retaliated on the Avars, or Huns 
i\f Pannonia, the same calamities which they had inflicted on the na-

tions. Their rings, the wooden fortifications which encircled their 
districts and villages, were broken down by the triple effort of a French 
army that was poured into their country by land and water, through 
the Carpathian mountains and along the plain of the Danube. After 
a bloody conflict of eight years, the loss of some French generals was 
avenged by the slaughter of the most noble Huns: the relics of the 
nation submitted: the royal residence of the chagan was left desolate 
and unknown; and the treasures, the rapine of two hundred and fifty 
years, enriched the victorious troops, or decorated the churches, of Italy 
and Gaul. 118 After the reduction of Pannonia, the empire of Charle-&lt; 
magne was bounded only by the conflux of the Danube with the Theiss 
and the Save: the provinces of Istria, Liburnia, and Dalmatia were an 
easy though unprofitable accession; and it was an effect of his mod- 
eration that he left the maritime cities under the real or nominal 
sovereignty of the Greeks. But these distant possessions added more 
to the reputation than to the power of the Latin emperor; nor did he 
risk any ecclesiastical foundations to reclaim the barbarians from their 
vagrant life and idolatrous worship. Some canals of communication, 
between the rivers, the Sa6ne and the Meuse, the Rhine and the 
Danube, were faintly attempted. 11 * Their execution would have vivi- 
fied the empire; and more cost and labour were often wasted in the 
structure of a cathedral. 

If we retrace the outlines of this geographical picture, it will be seen 
that the empire of the Franks extended, between east and west, from the 
Ebro to the Elbe or Vistula; between the north and south, from the 
duchy of Beneventum to the river Eyder, the perpetual boundary of 
Germany and Denmark. The personal and political importance of 
Charlemagne was magnified by the distress and division of the rest of 
Europe. The islands of Great Britain and Ireland were disputed by a 
crowd of princes of Saxon or Scottish origin; and, after the loss of Spain, 
the Christian and Gothic kingdom of Alphonso the Chaste was confined 
to the narrow range of the Asturian mountains. These petty sovereigns 
revered the power or virtue of the Carlovingian monarch, implored 
the honour and support of his alliance, and styled him their common 
parent, the sole and supreme emperor of the West. 115 He maintained

5X4 The junction of the Rhine and Danube was undertaken only for the 
service of the Pannonian war (Gaillard, Vie de Charlemagne, torn. ii. p. 312- 
315). The canal, which would have been only two leagues in length, and of 
which some traces are still extant in Swabia, was interruptedly excessive 
rains, military avocations, and superstitious fears (Schaepflin, Hist de

a more equal intercourse with the caliph Harun al Rashid, 110 whose 
dominion stretched from Africa to India, and accepted from his ambas- 
sadors a tent, a water-clock, an elephant, and the keys of the Holy 
Sepulchre. It is not easy to conceive the private friendship of a Frank 
and an Arab, who were strangers to each other's person, and language, 
and religion: but their public correspondence was founded on^ vanity, 
and their remote situation left no room for a competition of interest. 
Two-thirds of the Western empire of Rome were subject to Charlemagne, 
and the deficiency was amply supplied by his command of the inaccessi- 
ble or invincible nations of Germany. But in the choice of his enemies 
we may be reasonably surprised that he so often preferred the poverty 
of the north to the riches of the south. The three-and-thirty campaigns 
laboriously consumed in the woods and morasses of Germany would 
have sufficed to assert the amplitude of his title by the expulsion of the 
Greeks from Italy and the Saracens from Spain. The weakness of the 
Greeks would have insured an easy victory: and the holy crusade against 
the Saracens would have been prompted by glory and revenge, and 
loudly justified by religion and policy. Perhaps, in his expeditions 
beyond the Rhine and the Elbe, Jie aspired to save his monarchy from 
the fate of the Roman empire, to disarm the enemies of civilised society, 
and to eradicate the seed of future emigrations. But it has been wisely 
observed, that, in a light of precaution, all conquest must be ineffectual, 
unless it could be universal, since the increasing circle must be involved 
in a larger sphere of hostility. 117 The subjugation of Germany withdrew 
the veil which had so long concealed the continent or islands of Scandi- 
navia from the knowledge of Europe, and awakened the torpid courage 
of their barbarous natives. The fiercest of the Saxon idolaters escaped 
from the Christian tyrant to their brethren of the North; the Ocean and 
Mediterranean were covered with their piratical fleets; and Charlemagne 
beheld with a sigh the destructive progress of the Normans, who, in less 
than seventy years, precipitated the fall of his race and monarchy. 

Had the pope and the Romans revived the primitive constitution, the 
titles of emperor and Augustus were conferred on Charlemagne for the 
term of his life; and his successors, on each vacancy, must have ascended 
the throne by a formal or tacit election. But the association of his son 
Lewis the Pious asserts the independent right of monarchy and, conquest, 
and the emperor seems on this occasion to have foreseen and prevented 
the latent claims of the clergy. The royal youth was commanded to 

with a loose reference, the intercourse of Charlemagne and Egbert, the em- 
peror's gift of his own sword, and the modest answer of his Saxon disciple. 
The anecdote, if genuine, would have adorned our English histories.

Orientals are ignorant of the caliph's friendship for the Christian doga.

THE ROMAN EMPIRE 41 

take the crown from the altar, and with his own hands to place it on his 
head, as a gift which he held from God, his father, and the nation. 118 
The same ceremony was repeated, though with less energy, in the sub- 
sequent associations of Lothaire and Lewis the Second: the Carlovingian 
sceptre was transmitted from father to son in a lineal descent of four 
generations; and the ambition of the popes was reduced to the empty 
honour of crowning and anointing these hereditary princes, who were 
already invested with their power and dominions. The pious Lewis 
survived his brothers, and embraced tie whole empire of Charlemagne; 
but the nations and the nobles, his bishops and his children, quickly 
discerned that this mighty mass was no longer inspired by the same 
soul; and the foundations were undermined to the centre, while the 
external surface was yet fair and entire. After a war, or battle, which 
consumed one hundred thousand Franks, the empire was divided by 
treaty between his three sons, who had violated every filial and fraternal 
duty. The kingdoms of Germany and France were for ever separated; 
the provinces of Gaul, between the Rhone and the Alps, the Meuse and 
the Rhine, were assigned, with Italy, to the Imperial dignity of Lothaire. 
In the partition of his share, Lorraine and Aries, two recent and transi- 
tory kingdoms, were bestowed on the younger children: and Lewis 
the Second, his eldest son, was content with the realm of Italy, the 
proper and sufficient patrimony of a Roman emperor. On his death, 
without any male issue, the vacant throne was disputed by his uncles and 
cousins and the popes most dexterously seized the occasion of judging 
the claims and merits of the candidates, and of bestowing on the most 
obsequious, or most liberal, the Imperial office of advocate of the Roman 
church. The dregs of the Carlovingian race no longer exhibited any 
symptoms of virtue or power, and the ridiculous epithets of the bald, the 
stammerer, the fat, and the simple, distinguished the tame and uniform 
features of a crowd of kings alike deserving of oblivion. By the failure 
of the collateral branches the whole inheritance devolved to Charles the 
Fat, the last emperor of his family: his insanity authorised the desertion 
of Germany, Italy, and France: he was deposed in a diet, and solicited 
his daily bread from the rebels by whose contempt his life and liberty 
had been spared. According to the measure of their force, the governors, 
the bishops, and the lords usurped the fragments of the falling empire; 
and some preference was shown to the female or illegitimate blood of 
Charlemagne. Of the greater part, the title and possession were alike 
doubtful, 'and the merit was adequate to the contracted scale of their 
dominions. Those who could appear with an army at the gates of Rome 
were crowned emperors in the Vatican; but their modesty was more 

""Thegan, the biographer of Lewis, relates this coronation; and Baronius 
has honestly transcribed it (A.D. 813, No. 13, etc. ; see Gaillard, torn. ii. p. 506, 
507, 508), howsoever adverse to the claims of the popes. For the series of 
the Carlovingians, see the historians of France, Italy, and Germany; Pfeffel, 
Schmidt, Velly, Muratori, and even Voltaire, whose pictures are sometimes 
just, and always pleasing.

frequently satisfied with the appellation of kings of Italy: and the whole 
term of seventy-four years may be deemed a vacancy, from the abdica- 
tion of Charles the Fat to the establishment of Otho the First. 

Otho 119 was of the noble race of the dukes of Saxony; and if he truly 
descended from Witikind, the adversary and proselyte' of Charlemagne, 
the posterity of a vanquished people was exalted to reign over their 
conquerors. His father, Henry the Fowler, was elected, by the suffrage 
of lite nation, to save and institute the kingdom of Germany. Its 
limits 12 were enlarged on every side by his son, the first and greatest of 
the Othos. A portion of Gaul, to the west of the Rhine, along the banks 
of the Meuse and the Moselle, was assigned to the Germans, by whose 
blood and language it has been tinged since the time of Caesar and 
Tacitus. Between the Rhine, the Rhone, and the Alps, the successors of 
Otho acquired a vain supremacy over the broken kingdoms of Burgundy 
and Aries. In the North, Christianity was propagated by the sword of 
Otho, the conqueror and apostle of the Slavic nations of the Elbe and 
Oder: the marches of Brandenburg and Sleswick were fortified with 
German colonies; and the king of Denmark, the dukes of Poland and 
Bohemia, confessed themselves his tributary vassals. At the head of 
a victorious army he passed the Alps, subdued the kingdom of Italy, 
delivered the pope, and for ever fixed the Imperial crown in the name 
and nation of Germany. From that memorable era two maxims of 
public jurisprudence were introduced by force and ratified by time. 
I. That the prince, who was elected in the German diet, acquired from 
that instant the subject kingdoms of Italy and Rome. II. But that he 
might not legally assume the titles of emperor and Augustus, till he had 
received the crown from the hands of the Roman pontiff. 121 

The imperial dignity of Charlemagne was announced to the East by 
the alteration of his style; and instead of saluting his fathers, the Greek 
emperors, he presumed to adopt the more equal and familiar appellation 
of brother. 122 Perhaps in his connection with Irene he aspired to the 

"* He was the son of Otho, the son of Ludolph, in whose favour the duchy 
o Saxony had been instituted, AJD. 858. Ruotgerus, the biographer of a St. 
Bruno (Biblioth. Bunavianae Catalog, torn. iii. vol. ii. p. 679), gives a splendid 
character of his family. Atavorum atavi usque ad hominum memoriam omnes 
nobilissimi; nullus in eorum stirpe ignotus, nulltts degener facile reperitur 
(apud Struvium, Corp. Hist, German, p. 216)- Yet Gundling (in Henrico 
Aucupe) is not satisfied of his descent from Witikind. 

130 See the treatise of Conringius (de Finibus Imperil Germanici, Franco- 
furt 1680, in 4to) ; he rejects the extravagant and improper scale of the 
Roman and Carlovingian empires, and discusses with moderation the rights 
of Germany, her vassals, and her neighbours. 

^ The power of custom forces me to number Conrad I. and Henry I., the 
Fowler, in the list of emperors, a title which was never assumed by those 
kings of Germany. The Italians, Muratori for instance, are more scrupulous 
and correct, and only reckon the princes who have been crowned at Rome.

name of husband: his embassy to Constantinople spoke the language 
of peace and friendship, and might conceal a treaty of marriage witib 
that ambitious princess, who had renounced the most sacred duties oi' 
a mother. The nature, the duration, the probable consequences of such 
a union between two distant and dissonant empires, it is impossible to 
conjecture; but the unanimous silence of the Latins may teach us to 
suspect that the report was invented by the enemies of Irene, to charge 
her with the guilt of betraying the church and state to the srangers of 
the West. 123 The French ambassadors were the spectators, and had 
nearly been the victims, of the conspiracy of Nicephorus, and the 
national hatred. Constantinople was exasperated by the treason and 
sacrilege of ancient Rome: a proverb, " That the Franks were good 
fi lends and bad neighbours," was in every one's mouth; but it was 
dangerous to provoke a neighbour who might be tempted to reiterate, 
in the church of St. Sophia, the ceremony of his Imperial coronation. 
After a tedious journey of circuit and delay, the ambassadors of Nice- 
phorus found him in his camp, on the banks of the river Sala; and 
Charlemagne affected to confound their vanity -by displaying, in a 
Franconian village, the pomp, or at least the pride, of the Byzantine 
palace. 12 * The Greeks were successively led through four halls of 
audience: in the first they were ready to fall prostrate before a splendid 
personage in a chair of state, till he informed them that he was only 
a servant, the constable, or master of the horse, of the emperor. The 
same mistake and the same answer were repeated in the apartments of 
the count palatine, the steward, and the chamberlain; and their impa- 
tience was gradually heightened, till the doors of the presence-chamber 
were thrown open, and they beheld the genuine monarch on his throne, 
enriched with the foreign luxury which he despised, and encircled with 
the love and reverence of his victorious chiefs. A treaty of peace and 
alliance was concluded between the two empires, and the limits of the 
East and West were defined by the right of present possession. But 
the Greeks 125 soon forgot this humiliating equality, or remembered it 
only to hate the barbarians by whom it was extorted. During the short 
union of virtue and power, they respectfully saluted the august Charle- 

c. 28, p. 128. Perhaps it was on their account that, like Augustus, he affected 
some reluctance to receive the empire. 

""Theophanes speaks of the coronation and unction of Charles, KapovXoy 
(Qironograph. p. 399 [torn. i. p. 733, ed. Bonn]), and of his treaty of mar- 
riage with Irene (p. 402 [p. 737, ed. Bonn]), which is unknown to the Latins. 
Gaillard relates his transactions with the Greek empire (torn. ii. p. 446-468). 

** Gaillard very properly observes that this pageant was a farce suitable to 
children only; but that it was indeed represented in the presence, and for the 
benefit, of children of a larger growth.

magne with the acclamations of basUew, and emperor of the Romans, 
As soon as these qualities were separated in the person of his pious son, 
the Byzantine letters were inscribed, " To the king, or, as he styles 
himself, the emperor, of the Franks and Lombards." When both 
power and virtue were extinct, they despoiled Lewis the Second of his 
hereditary title, and, with the barbarous appellation of rex or rega, de- 
graded him among the crowd of Latin princes. His reply m is expres- 
sive of his weakness: he proves, with some learning, that both in sacred 
and profane history the name of king is synonymous with the Greek 
word basileus: if, at Constantinople, it were assumed in a more exclusive 
and imperial sense, he claims from his ancestors, and from the pope, 
a just participation of the honours of the Roman purple. The same 
controversy was revived in the reign of the Othos; and their ambassador 
describes in lively colours the insolence of the Byzantine court. 127 The 
Greeks affected to despise the poverty and ignorance of the Franks and 
Saxons; and in their last decline refused to prostitute to the kings of 
Germany the title of Roman emperors. 

These emperors, in the election of the popes, continued to exercise the 
powers which had been assumed by the Gothic and Grecian princes; and 
the importance of this prerogative increased with the temporal estate 
and spiritual jurisdiction of the Roman church. In the Christian aris- 
tocracy the principal members of the clergy still formed a senate tc 
assist the administration, and to supply the vacancy, of the bishop. 
Rome was divided into twenty-eight parishes, and each parish was 
governed by a cardinal-priest, or presbyter a title which, however 
common and modest in its origin, has aspired to emulate the purple 
of kings. Their number was enlarged by the association of the seven 
deacons of the most considerable hospitals, the seven palatine judges 
of the Lateran, and some dignitaries of the church. This ecclesiastical 
senate was directed by the seven cardinal-bishops of the Roman province, 
who were less occupied in the suburb dioceses of Ostia, Porto, Velitrae, 
Tusculum, Praeneste, Tibur, and the Sabines, than by their weekly 
service in the Lateran, and their superior share in the honours and 
authority of the apostolic see. On the death of the pope these bishops 
recommended a successor to the suffrage of the college of cardinals, 128 

** See the epistle, in Paralipomena, of the anonymous writer of Salerno 
(Script ItaL torn. ii. pars ii. p. 243-254, c. 93-107), whom Baronius (A.D. 871, 
No. 51-71) mistook for Erchempert, when he transcribed it in his Annals. 

^Ipse enim vos, non imperatorem, id est Ba&lt;riXAx sua lingua, sed ob in- 
dignationem Tifra, id est regem nostra vocabat (Liutprand, in Legat. in 
Script ItaL torn. ii. pars i. p. 479). The pope had exhorted Nicephorus, 
emperor of the Greeks, to make peace with Otho, the august emperor of the 
Romans qua inscriptio secundum Graecos peccatoria [peccatrix] et temeraria

assra (Discipline de 1'Eglise, torn. i. p. 1261-1298), Muratori (Antiquitat. 
Italiae Medn ^Evi. torn. vi. Dissert. Ixi. D. 159-182), and Mosheim (Institut. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 45 

and their choice was ratified or rejected by the applause or clamour of 
the Roman people. But the election was imperfect; nor could the 
pontiff be legally consecrated till the emperor, the advocate of the church, 
had graciously signified his approbation and consent. The royal com- 
missioner examined on the spot the form and freedom of the proceedings; 
nor was it till after a previous scrutiny into the qualifications of the 
candidates that he accepted an oath of fidelity, and confirmed the dona- 
tions which had successively enriched the patrimony of St. Peter. In 
the frequent schisms the rival claims were submitted to the sentence oi 
the emperor; and in a synod of bishops he presumed to judge, to con- 
demn, and to punish the crimes of a guilty pontiff. Otho the First 
imposed a treaty on the senate and people, who engaged to prefer the 
candidate most acceptable to his majesty: 12 his successors anticipated or 
prevented their choice: they bestowed the Roman benefice, like the 
bishoprics of Cologne or Bamberg, on their chancellors or preceptors; 
and whatever might be the merit of a Frank or Saxon, his name suffi- 
ciently attests the interposition of foreign power. These acts of preroga- 
tive were most speciously excused by the vices of a popular election. 
The competitor who had been excluded by the cardinals appealed to the 
passions or avarice of the multitude; the Vatican and the Lateran were 
stained with blood; and the most powerful senators, the marquises of 
Tuscany and the counts of Tusculum, held the apostolic see in a long 
and disgraceful servitude. The Roman pontiffs of the ninth and tenth 
centuries were insulted, imprisoned, and murdered by their tyrants; 
and such was their indigence, after the loss and usurpation of the eccles- 
iastical patrimonies, that they could neither support the state of a prince, 
nor exercise the charity of a priest. 130 The influence of two sister 
prostitutes, Marozia and Theodora, was founded on their wealth and 
beauty, their political and amorous intrigues: the most strenuous of their 
lovers were rewarded with the Roman mitre, and their reign 1S1 may have

the election. The cardinal-bishops, so highly exalted by Peter Damianus, are 
sunk to a level with the rest of the sacred college. 

""Firmiter jurantes, nunquam se papam electuros aut ordinaturos, praeter 
consensum et electionem Othonis et filii sui (Liutprand, L vi. c. 6, p. 472). 
This important concession may either supply or confirm the decree of the 
clergy and people of Rome, so fiercely rejected by Baronius, Pagi, and Muni- 
tori (A.D. 964), and so well defended and explained by St. Marc (Abrege, 
torn. li. p. 808-816, torn. iv. p. 1167-1185). Consult that historical critic, and 
the Annals of Muratori, for the election and confirmation of each pope. 

"The oppression and vices of the Roman church in the tenth century 
are strongly painted in the history and legation of Liutprand (see p. 440, 
450, 471-476, 479, etc.) ; and it is whimsical enough to observe Muratori tem- 
pering the invectives of Baronius against the popes. But these popes had been 
chosen, not by the cardinals, but by lay-patrons. 

331 The time of Pope Joan (papissa Joanna) is placed somewhat earlier than 
Theodora or Marozia : and the two years of her imaginary reign are forcibly 
inserted between Leo IV. and Benedict III. But the contemporary Anastasiu? 
indissolubly links the death of Leo and the elevation of Benedict (illico, mor.

iuggested to the darker ages 132 the fable 13S of a female pope. 134 The 
bastard son, the grandson, and the great-grandson of Marozia, a rare 
genealogy, were seated in the chair of St. Peter; and it was at the age 
of nineteen years that the second of these became the head of the Latin 
church. His youth and manhood were of a suitable complexion; and the 
nations of pilgrims could bear testimony to the charges that were urged 
against him in a Roman synod, and in the presence of Otho the Great. 
As John XII. had renounced the dress and decencies of his profession, 
the soldier may not perhaps be dishonoured by the wine which he drank, 
the blood that he spilt, the flames that he kindled, or the licentious pur- 
suits of gaming and hunting. His open simony might be the consequence 
of distress; and his blasphemous invocation of Jupiter and Venus, if it 
be true, could not possibly be serious. But we read, with some surprise, 
that the worthy grandson of Marozia lived in public adultery with the 
matrons of Rome; that the Lateran palace was turned into a school for 
prostitution; and that his rapes of virgins and widows had deterred the 
female pilgrims from visiting the tomb of St. Peter, lest, in the devout 
act, they should be violated by his successor. 135 The Protestants have 
dwelt with malicious pleasure on these characters of antichrist; but to 
a philosophic eye the vices of the clergy are far less dangerous than their 
virtues. After a long series of scandal the apostolic see was reformed 

p. 247) ; and the accurate chronology of Pagi, Muratori, and Leibnitz fixes 
both events to the year 857. . 

132 The advocates for Pope Joan produce one hundred and fifty witnesses, 
or rather echoes, of the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries. They 
bear testimony against themselves and the legend, by ^multiplying the proof 
that so curious a story must have been repeated by writers of every descrip- 
tion to whom it was known. On those of the ninth and tenth centuries the 
recent event would have flashed with a double force. Would Photius have 
spared such a reproach? Could Liutprand have missed such _ scandal ? It 
is scarcely worth while to discuss the various readings of Martinus Polonus, 
Sigebert of Gemblours, or even Marianus Scotus ; but a most palpable forgery 
is the passage of Pope Joan which has been foisted into some MSS. and 
editions of the Roman Anastasius. 

^As false, it deserves that name; but I would not pronounce it incredible. 
Suppose a famous French chevalier of our own times to have been born in 
Italy, and educated in the church, instead of the army: her merit or fortune 
might have raised her to St. Peter's chair ; her amours would have been nat- 
ural ; her delivery in the streets unlucky, but not improbable. 

134 Till the Reformation the tale was repeated and believed without offence: 
and Joan's female statue long occupied her place among the popes in the 
cathedral of Sienna (Pagi, Critica, torn. iii. p. 624-626). She has been 
annihilated by two learned Protestants, Blondel and Bayle (Dictionnaire 
Critique, PAJESSE, POLONUS, BLONDEL) : but their brethren were scandalised 
by this equitable and generous criticism. Spanheim and Lenfant attempt to 
save this poor engine of controversy; and even Mosheim condescends to 
cherish some doubt and suspicion (p. 289).

and exalted by the austerity and zeal of Gregory VII. That ambitious 
monk devoted his life to the execution of two projects. I. To fix in the 
college of cardinals the freedom and independence of election, . d for 
ever to abolish the right or usurpation of the emperors and the Roman 
people. II. To bestow and resume the Western empire as a fief or 
benefice 18 of the church, and to extend his temporal dominion over the 
kings and kingdoms of the earth. After a contest of fifty years the first 
of these designs was accomplished by the firm support of the ecclesiastical 
order, whose liberty was connected with that of their chief. But the 
second attempt, though was crowned with some partial and apparent 
success, has been vigorously resisted by the secular power, and finally 
extinguished by the improvement of human reason. 

In the revival of the empire of Rome neither the bishop nor the people 
could bestow on Charlemagne or Otho the provinces which were lost, as 
they had been won by the chance of arms. But the Romans were free 
to choose a master for themselves; and the powers which had been dele- 
gated to the patrician were irrevocably granted to the French and Saxon 
emperors of the West. The broken records of the times 187 preserve some 
remembrance of their palace, their mint, their tribunal, their edicts, 
and the Sword of justice, which, as late as thr, thirteenth century, was 
derived from Caesar to the prsefect of the city. 138 Between the arts of 
the popes and the violence of the people this supremacy was crushed and 
annihilated. Content with the titles of emperor and Augustus, the 
successors of Charlemagne neglected to assert this local jurisdiction. 
In the hour of prosperity their ambition i diverted by re alluring 
objects; and in the decay and division of the empire they were oppressed 
by the defence of their hereditary provinces. Amidst the ruins of Italy 
the famous Marozia invited one of the usurpers to assume the character 
of her third husband; and Hugh king of Burgundy was introduced by 
her faction into the mole of Hadrian or castle of St. Angelo, which com- 
mands the principal bridge and entrance of Rome. Her son by the first 
marriage, Alberic, was compelled to attend at the nuptial banquet; but 
his reluctant and ungraceful service was chastised with a blow by his 
new father. The blow was productive of a revolution. " Romans/' ex- 
claimed the youth, " once you were the masters of the world, and these 
Burgundians the most abject of your slaves. They now reign, these 

""A ne\v example of the mischief of equivocation is the beneficium (Du- 
cange, torn. i. p. 617, etc.), which the pope conferred on the emperor Frederic

voracious and brutal savages, and my injury is the commencement of 
your servitude." 139 The alarum-bell rang to arms in every quarter of the 
city: the Burgundians retreated with haste and shame; Marozia was 
imprisoned by her victorious son; and his brother, Pope John XI., was 
reduced to the exercise of his spiritual functions. With the title of 
prince, Alberic possessed above twenty years the government of Rome; 
and he is said to have gratified the popular prejudice by restoring the 
office, or at least the title, of consuls and tribunes. His son and heir 
Octavian assumed, with the pontificate, the name of John XII.: like his 
predecessor, he was provoked by the Lombard princes to seek a deliverer 
for the church and republic; and the services of Otho were rewarded 
with the Imperial dignity. But the Saxon was imperious, the Romans 
were impatient, the festival of the coronation was disturbed by the secret 
conflict of prerogative and freedom, and Otho commanded his sword- 
bearer not to stir from his person lest he should be assaulted and mur- 
dered at the foot of the altar. 140 Before he repassed the Alps, the 
emperor chastised the revolt of the people and the ingratitude of John 
XII. The pope was degraded in a synod; tie prefect was mounted on 
an ass, whipped through the city, and cast into a dungeon; thirteen of 
the most guilty were hanged, others were multilated or banished; and this 
severe process was justified by the ancient laws of Theodosius and 
Justinian. The voice of fame has accused the second Otho of a perfidious 
and bloody act, the massacre of the senators, whom he had invited to 
his table under the fair semblance of hospitality and friendship. 141 In 
the inority of his son Otho the Third, Rome made a bold attempt to 
shake off the Saxon yoke, and the consul Crescentius was the Brutus of 
the republic. From the condition of a subject and an exile he twice rose 
to the command of the city, oppressed, expelled, and created the popes, 
and formed a conspiracy for restoring the authority of the Greek em- 
perors. In the fortress of St. Angelo he maintained an obstinate siege, 
till the unfortunate consul was betrayed by a promise of safety: his 
body was suspended on a gibbet, and his head was exposed on the battle- 
ments of the castle. By a reverse of fortune, Otho, after separating his 
troops, was besieged three days, without food, in his palace, and a dis- 
graceful escape saved him from the justice or fury of the Romans. The 
senator Ptolemy was the leader of the people, and the widow of Cres- 
centius enjoyed the pleasure or the fame of revenging her husband by a

writers Albericus is more frequently styled princeps Romanorum.

THE ROMAN EMPIRE 49 

poison which she administered to her Imperial lover. It was the design 
of Otho the Third to abandon the ruder countries of the North, to erect 
his throne in Italy, and to revive the institutions of the Roman monarchy. 
But his successors only once in their lives appeared on the banks of the 
Tiber to receive their crown in the Vatican. 142 Their absence was con- 
temptible, their presence odious and formidable. They descended from 
the Alps at the head of their barbarians, who were strangers and enemies 
to the country; and their transient visit was a scene of tumult and 
bloodshed. 148 . A faint remembrance of their ancestors still tormented 
the Romans; and they beheld with pious indignation the succession of 
Saxons, Franks, Swabians, and Bohemians, who usurped the purple and 
prerogatives of the Caesars. 

There is nothing perhaps more adverse to nature and reason than te 
hold in obedience remote countries and foreign nations in opposition to 
their inclination and interest. A torrent of barbarians may pass over 
the earth, but an extensive empire must be supported by a refined system 
of policy and oppression: in the centre an absolute power, prompt in 
action and rich in resources: a swift and easy communication with the 
extreme parts: fortifications to check the first effort of rebellion: a regular 
administration to protect and punish; and a well-disciplined army to 
inspire fear, without provoking discontent and despair. Far different 
was the situation of the German Caesars, who were ambitious to enslave 
the kingdom of Italy. Their patrimonial estates were stretched along 
the Rhine, or scattered in the provinces; but this ample domain was 
alienated by the imprudence or distress of successive princes; and their 
revenue, from minute and vexatious prerogative, was scarcely sufficient 
for the maintenance of their household. Their troops were formed by 
the legal or voluntary service of their feudal vassals, who passed the 
Alps with reluctance, assumed the licence of rapine and disorder, and 
capriciously deserted before the end of the campaign. Whole armies 
were swept away by the pestilential influence of the climate: the sur- 
vivors brought back the bones of their princes and nobles; 144 and the 
effects of their own intemperance were often imputed to the treachery 
and malice of the Italians, who rejoiced at least in the calamities of the 
barbarians. This irregular tyranny might contend on equal terms with

tenth century, are preserved in the Panegyric on Berengarius (Script Ital.

Leibnitz. Sigonius has related the whole process of the Roman expedition, 
in good Latin, but with some errors of time and fact (1. vii. p. 441-446).

the petty tyrants of Italy; nor can the people, or the reader, be much 
interested in the event of the quarrel. But in the eleventh and twelfth 
centuries the Lombards rekindled the flame of industry and freedom, and 
the generous example was at length imitated by the republics of Tuscany. 
In the Italian cities a municipal government had never been totally 
abolished; and their first privileges were granted by the favour and 
policy of the emperors, who were desirous of erecting a plebeian barrier 
against the independence of the nobles. But their rapid progress, the 
daily extension of their power and pretensions, were founded on the 
numbers and spirit of these rising communities. 148 Each city filled the 
measure of her diocese or district: the jurisdiction of the counts and 
bishops, of the marquises and counts, was banished from the land; and 
the proudest nobles were persuaded or compelled to desert their solitary 
castles, and to embrace the more honourable character of freemen and 
magistrates. The legislative authority was inherent in the general assem- 
bly; but the executive powers were intrusted to three consuls, annually 
chosen from the three orders of captains, valvassors,*** and commons, 
into which the republic was divided. Under the protection of equal law 
the labours of agriculture and commerce were gradually revived; but 
the martial spirit of the Lombards was nourished by the presence of 
danger; and as often as the bell was rung, or the standard 14T erected, the 
gates of the city poured forth a numerous and intrepid band, whose zeal 
in their own cause was soon guided by the use and discipline of arms. 
At the foot of these popular ramparts the pride of the Caesars was over- 
thrown; and the invincible genius of liberty prevailed over the two 
Frederics, the greatest princes of the middle age: -the first, superior per- 
haps in military prowess; the second, who undoubtedly excelled in the 
softer accomplishments of peace and learning. 

Ambitious of restoring the splendour of the purple, Frederic the First 
Invaded the republics of Lombardy with the arts of a statesman, the 
valour of a soldier, and the cruelty of a tyrant. The recent discovery 
of the Pandects had renewed a science most favourable to despotism; 
and his venal advocates proclaimed the emperor the absolute master of 
the lives and properties of his subjects. His royal prerogatives, in a less 
odious sense, were acknowledged in the diet of Roncaglia, and the 
revenue of Italy was fixed at thirty thousand pounds of silver, 148 which

were multiplied to an indefinite demand by the rapine of the fiscal 
officers. The obstinate cities were reduced y the terror or the force of 
his arms; his captives were delivered to the xecutioner, or shot from 
his military engines; and after the siege r of Milan the 

buildings of that stately capital were razed to the ground, three hundred 
hostages were sent into Germany, and the inhabitants v;ere dispersed in 
four villages, under the yoke of the inflexible conqueror. 1 * 9 But Milan 
soon rose from her ashes; and the league of Lombardy was cemented 
by distress: their cause was espoused by Venice, Pope Alexander the 
Third, and the Greek emperor: the fabric of oppression was overturned 
in a day; and in the treaty of Constance, Frederic subscribed, with some 
reservations, the freedom of four-and-twenty cities. His grandson con- 
tended with their vigour and maturity; but Frederic the Second 16 was 
endowed with some personal and peculiar advantages. His birth and 
education recommended him to the Italians; and in the implacable dis- 
cord of the two factions the Ghibelins were attached to the emperor, 
while the Guelfs displayed the banner of liberty and the church. The 
court of Rome had slumbered when his father Henry the Sixth was 
permitted to unite with the empire the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily; 
and from these hereditary realms the son derived an ample and ready 
supply of troops and treasure. Yet Frederic the Second was finally 
oppressed by the arms of the Lombards and the thunders of the Vatican: 
his kingdom was given to a stranger, and the last of his family was be- 
headed at Naples on a public scaffold. During sixty years no^emperoi 
appeared in Italy, and the name was remembered only by the ignomin- 
ious sale of the last relics of sovereignty. 

The barbarian conquerors of the West were pleased to decorate their 
chief with the title of emperor; but it was not their design to invest him 
with the despotism of Constantine and Justinian. The persons of the 
Germans were free, their conquests were their own, and their national 
character was animated by a spirit which scorned the servile jurispru- 
dence of the new or the ancient Rome. It would have been a vain and 
dangerous attempt to impose a monarch on the armed freemen, who 
were impatient of a magistrate; on the bold, who refused to obey; on 
the powerful, who aspired to command. The empire of Charlemagne 
and Otho was distributed among the dukes of the nations or provinces* 
the counts of the smaller districts, and the margraves of the inarches 
or frontiers, who all united the civil and military authority as it had. 
been delegated to the lieutenants of the first Caesars. The Roman 
governors, who for the most part were soldiers of fortune, seduced their

mercenary legions, assumed the Imperial purple, and either failed or 
succeeded in their revolt, without wounding the power and unity of 
government. If the dukes, margraves, and counts of Germany were 
less audacious in their claims, the consequences of their success were 
more lasting and pernicious to the state. Instead of aiming at the 
supreme rank, they silently laboured to establish and appropriate their 
provincial independence. Their ambition was seconded by the weight 
of their estates and vassals, their mutual example and support, the 
common interest of the subordinate nobility, the change of princes and 
families, the minorities of Otho the Third and Henry the Fourth, the 
ambition of the popes, and the vain pursuit of the fugitive crowns of 
Italy and Rome. All the attributes of regal and territorial jurisdiction 
were gradually usurped by the commanders of the provinces; the right 
of peace and war, of life and death, of coinage and taxation, of foreign 
alliance and domestic economy. Whatever had been seized by violence 
was ratified by favour or distress, was granted as the price of a doubtful 
vote or a voluntary service; whatever had been granted to one could 
not without injury be denied to his successor or equal; and every act 
of local or temporary possession was insensibly moulded into the con- 
stitution of the Germanic kingdom. In every province the visible 
presence of the duke or count was interposed between the throne and the 
nobles; the subjects of the law became the vassals of a private chief; ' 
and the standard which he received from his sovereign was often raised 
against him in the field. The temporal power of the clergy was cherished 
and exalted by the superstition or policy of the Carlovingian and Saxon 
dynasties, who blindly depended on their moderation and fidelity; and 
the bishoprics of Germany were made equal in extent and privilege, 
superior in wealth and population, to the most ample states of the mili- 
tary order. As long as the emperors retained the prerogative of bestow- 
ing on every vacancy these ecclesiastic and secular benefices, their cause 
was maintained by the gratitude or ambition of their friends and 
favourites. But in the quarrel of the investitures they were deprived of 
their influence over the, episcopal chapters; the freedom of election was 
restored, and the sovereign was reduced, by a solemn mockery, to his 
first prayers, the recommendation, once in his reign, to a single prebend 
in each church. The secular governors, instead of being recalled at the 
will of a superior, could be degraded only by the sentence of their peers. 
In the first age of the monarchy the appointment of the son to the duchy 
or county of his father was solicited as a favour; it was gradually 
obtained as a custom, and extorted as a right: the lineal succession was 
often extended to the collateral or female branches; the states of the 
empire (their popular, and at length their legal, appellation) were 
divided and alienated by testament and sale; and all idea of a public 
trust was lost in that of a private and perpetual inheritance. The em- 
peror could not even be enriched by the casualties of forfeiture and 
extinction: within the term of a year he was obliged to dispose of the

vacant fief; and in the choice of the candidate it was his duty to consult 
either the general or the provincial diet. 

After the death of Frederic the Second, Germany was left a monster 
with a hundred heads. A crowd of princes and prelates disputed the 
ruins of the empire: the lords of innumerable castles were less prone to 
obey than to imitate their superiors; and, according to the measure of 
their strength, their incessant hostilities received the name of conquest 
or robbery. Such anarchy was the inevitable consequence of the laws 
and manners of Europe; and the kingdoms of France and Italy were 
shivered into fragments by the violence of the same tempest. But the 
Italian^ cities and the French vassals were divided and destroyed, while 
the union of the Germans has produced, under the name of an empire, 
a great system of a federative republic. In the frequent and at last the 
perpetual institution of diets, a national spirit was kept alive, and the 
powers of a common legislature are still exercised by the three branches 
or colleges of the electors, the princes, and the free and Imperial cities 
of Germany. I. Seven of the most powerful feudatories were permitted 
to assume, with a distinguished name and rank, the exclusive privilege 
of choosing the Roman emperor; and these electors were the king of 
Bohemia, the duke of Saxony, the margrave of Brandenburg, the counr 
palatine of the Rhine, and the three archbishops of Mentz, of Trfeves, 
and of Cologne. 151 II. The college of princes and prelates purged them- 
selves of a promiscuous multitude: they reduced to four representative 
votes the long series of independent counts, and excluded the nobles or 
equestrian order, sixty thousand of whom, as in the Polish diets, had 
appeared on horseback in the field of election. III. The pride of birth 
and dominion, of the sword and the mitre, wisely adopted the commons 
as the third branch of the legislature, and, in the progress of society, 
they were introduced about the same era into the national assemblies of 
France, England, and Germany. The Hanseatic League commanded the 
trade and navigation of the north: the confederates of the Rhine secured 
the peace and intercourse of the inland country; the influence of the 
cities has been adequate to their wealth and policy, and their negative 
still invalidates the acts of the two superior colleges of electors and 
princes. 152

all the events leading up to the formation of what Bury aptly calls the 
Electoral College, see Bryce, Holy Roman Empire (pp. 229, 230). The 
Electoral College "is mentioned A.D. 1152, and in somewhat clearer terms in 
1198, as a distinct body, but without anything to show who composed it. 
First in A.D. 1263 does a letter from Pope Urban IV. say that by immemorial 
custom the right of choosing the Roman king belonged to seven persons, 
the seven who had just divided their votes on Richard of Cornwall and 
Alphonso of Castile." O. S.]

54 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

It is in the fourteenth century that we may view in the strongest light 
the state and contrast of the Roman empire of Germany, which no 
longer held, except on the borders of the Rhine and Danube, a single 
province of Trajan or Constantine. Their unworthy successors were 
the counts of Hapsburg, of Nassau, of Luxemburg, and of Schwartzen- 
burg: the emperor Henry the Seventh procured for his son the crown 
of Bohemia, and his grandson Charles the Fourth was born among a 
people strange and barbarous in the estimation of the Germans them- 
selves. 158 After the excommunication of Lewis of Bavaria, he received 
the gift or promise of the vacant empire from the Roman pontiffs, who, 
in the exile and captivity of Avignon, affected trie dominion of the earth. 
The death of his competitors united the electoral college, and Charles 
was unanimously saluted king of the Romans, and future emperor; a 
title which in the same age was prostituted to the Caesars of Germany 
and Greece. The German emperor was no more than the elective and 
impotent magistrate of an aristocracy of princes, who had not left him a 
village that he might call his own. His best prerogative was the right 
of presiding and proposing in the national senate, which was convened 
at his .summons; and his native kingdom of Bohemia, less opulent than 
the adjacent city of Nuremberg, was the firmest seat of his power and 
the richest source of his revenue. The army with which he passed the 
Alps consisted of three hundred horse. In the cathedral of St. Ambrose, 
Charles was crowned with the iron crown, which tradition ascribed to 
the Lombard monarchy; but he was admitted only with a peaceful train ; 
the gates of the city were shut upon him; and the king of Italy was 
held a captive by the arms of the Visconti, whom he confirmed in the 
sovereignty of Milan. In the Vatican he was again crowned with the 
golden crown of the empire; but, in obedience to a secret treaty, the 
Roman emperor immediately withdrew, without reposing a single night 
within the walls of Rome. The eloquent Petrarch, 154 whose fancy re- 
vived the visionary glories of the Capitol, deplores and upbraids the 

know of any country (Nouvel Abrege Chronologique de THistoire et du 
Droit Public d'Allemagne; Paris, 1776, 2 vols. in 4to). His learning and 
judgment have discerned the most interesting facts; his simple brevity com- 
prises them in a narrow space; his chronological order distributes them under 
the proper dates ; and an elaborate index collects them under their respective 
heads. To this work, in a less perfect state, Dr. Robertson was gratefully 
indebted for that masterly sketch which traces even the modern changes of 
the Germanic body. The Corpus Historic Germanicae of Struvius has been 
likewise consulted, the more usefully, as that huge compilation is fortified 
in every page with the original texts. 

"*Yet, personally, Charles IV. must not be considered as a barbarian. 
After his education at Paris, he recovered the use of the Bohemian, his 
native, idiom; and the emperor conversed and wrote with equal facility in 
French, Latin, Italian, and German (Struvius, p, 615, 616). Petrarch always 
represents him as a polite and learned prince. 

"* Besides the German and Italian historians, the expedition of Charles IV. 
is painted in lively and original colours in the curious Me*moires sur la Vie 
de Petrarque, torn. iii. p. 376-430, by the Abb6 de Sade, whose prolixity has 
never been blamed by any reader of taste and curiosity. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 55 

ignominious flight of the Bohemian; and even his contemporaries could 
observe that the sole exercise of his authority was in the lucrative sale 
of privileges and titles. The gold of Italy secured the election of his 
son; but such was the shameful poverty of the Roman emperor, that 
his person was arrested by a butcher in the streets of Worms, and was 
detained in the public inn as a pledge or hostage for the payment of his 
expenses. 

From this humiliating scene let us turn to the apparent majesty of 
the same Charles in the diets of the empire. The golden bull, which 
fixes the Germanic constitution, is promulgated in the style of a sover- 
eign and legislator. A hundred princes bowed before his throne, and 
exalted their own dignity by the voluntary honours which they yielded 
to their chief or minister. At the royal banquet the hereditary great 
officers, the seven electors, who in rank and title were equal to kings, 
performed their solemn and domestic service of the palace. The seals of 
the triple kingdom were borne in state by the archbishops of Mentz, 
Cologne, and Troves, the perpetual arch-chancellors of Germany, Italy, 
and Aries. The great marshal, on horseback, exercised his function with 
a silver measure of oats, which he emptied on the ground, and immedi- 
ately dismounted to regulate the order of the guests. The great steward, 
the count palatine of the Rhine, placed the dishes on the table. The 
great chamberlain, the margrave of Brandenburg, presented, after the 
repast, the golden ewer and basin, to wash. The king of Bohemia, as 
great cupbearer, was represented by the emperor's brother, the duke of 
Luxemburg and Brabant; and the procession was dosed by the great 
huntsmen, who introduced a boar and a stag, with a loud chorus of 
horns and hounds. 155 Nor was the supremacy of the emperor confined 
to Germany alone: the hereditary monarchs of Europe confessed the pre- 
eminence of his rank and dignity: he was the first of the Christian 
princes, the temporal head of the great republic of the West: 150 to his 
person the title of majesty was long appropriated; and he disputed with 
the pope the sublime prerogative of creating kings and assembling coun- 
cils. The oracle of the civil law, the learned Bartolus, was a pensioner 
of Charles the Fourth; and his school resounded with the doctrine thai 
the Roman emperor was the rightful sovereign of the earth, from the 
rising to the setting sun. The contrary opinion was condemned, not as 
an error, but as a heresy, since even the Gospel had pronounced, " And 
there went forth a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should 
be taxed." 157 

If we annihilate the interval of time and space between Augustus and 
Charles, strong and striking will be the contrast between the two Caesars:

the Bohemian, who concealed his weakness under the mask of ostenta- 
tion, and the Roman, who disguised his strength under the semblance 
of modesty. At the head of his victorious legions, in his reign over the 
sea and land, from the Nile and Euphrates to the Atlantic Ocean, Augus- 
tus professed himself the servant of the state and the equal of his fellow- 
citizens. The conqueror of Rome and her provinces assumed the popular 
and legal form of a censor, a consul, and a tribune. His will was the 
law of mankind, but in the declaration of his laws he borrowed the voice 
of the senate and people; and, from their decrees, their master accepted 
and renewed his temporary commission to administer the republic. Tn 
his dress, his domestics, 158 his titles, in all the offices of social life, 
Augustus maintained the character of a private Roman; and his most 
.artful flatterers respected the secret of his absolute and perpetual 
naonarchy.

AFTER pursuing above six hundred years the fleeting Caesars of Con-

the eastern borders of the Greek monarchy. While the state was ex- 
hausted by the Persian war, and the church was distracted by the 
Nestoran and Monophysite sects, Mohammed, with the sword in one 
hand and the Koran in the other, erected his throne on the ruins of 
Christianity and of Rome. The genius of the Arabian prophet, the man- 
ners of his nation, and the spirit of his religion, involve the causes of 
the decline and fall of the Eastern empire; and our eyes are curiously 
intent on one of the most memorable revolutions which have impressed 
a new and lasting character on the nations of the globe. 1 
In the vacant space between Persia, Syria, Egypt, and ^Ethiopia, the

chini. Extract of his work, in the Bibliotheque Italique, torn, iv, p. 175. His

rank, and possibly not more numerous than those of Pollio or Lentulus. They 
roily prove the general riches of the city.

I must profess my total ignorance of the Oriental tongues, and my gratitude to

Arabian peninsula 2 may be conceived as a triangle of spacious but irreg- 
ular dimensions. From the northern point of Bdes, 8 on the Euphrates, 
a line of fifteen hundred miles is terminated by the Straits of Babel- 
mandeb and the land of frankincense. About half this length may be 
allowed for the middle breadth, from east to west, from Bassora to 
Suez, from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea. 4 The sides of the triangle 
are gradually enlarged, and the southern basis presents a front of a 
thousand miles to the Indian Ocean. The entire surface of the peninsula 
exceeds in a fourfold proportion that of Germany or France; but the far 
greater part has been justly stigmatised with the epithets of the stony and 
the sandy. Even the wilds of Tartary are decked, by the hand of nature, 
with lofty trees and luxuriant herbage; and the lonesome traveller de- 
rives a sort of comfort and society from the presence of vegetable life. 
But in the dreary waste of Arabia a boundless level of sand is inter- 
sected by sharp and naked mountains; and the face of the desert, with- 
out shade or shelter, is scorched by the direct and intense rays of a

the Latin and French translators, Greaves (in Hudson, torn, iii.) and Galland 
(Voyage de la Palestine par la Roque, p. 265-346), have opened to us the 
Arabia of Abulfeda, the most copious and correct account of the peninsula, 
which may be enriched, however, from the Bibliotheque Orientale of D'Her-

an honourable distinction: Busching (Geographic par Berenger, torn. viii.

tropical sun. Instead of refreshing breezes, the winds, particularly from 
the south-west diffuse a noxious and even deadly vapour; the hillocks 
of sand which they alternately raise and scatter are compared to the 
billows of the ocean, and whole caravans, whole armies, have been lost 
and buried in the whirlwind. The common benefits of water are an 
object of desire and contest; and such is the scarcity of wood, that 
some art is requisite to preserve and propagate the element of fire. 
Arabia is destitute of navigable rivers, which fertilise the soil, and convey 
its produce to the adjacent regions: the torrents that fall from the hills 
are imbibed by the thirsty earth: the rare and hardy plants, the tamarind 
or the acacia, that strike their roots into the clefts of the rocks, are 
nourished by the dews of the night: a scanty supply of rain is collected 
in cisterns and aqueducts; the wells and springs are the secret treasure 
of the desert; and the pilgrim of Mecca, 5 after many a dry and sultry 
march, is disgusted by the taste of the waters which have rolled over 
a bed of sulphur or salt. Such is the general and genuine picture of the 
climate of Arabia. The experience of evil enhances the value of any 
local or partial enjoyments!. A shady grove, a green pasture, a stream 
of fresh water, are sufficient to attract a colony of sedentary Arabs to 
the fortunate spots which can afford food and refreshment to them- 
selves and their cattle, and which encourage their industry in the cul- 
tivation of the palm-tree and the vine. The high lands that border on 
the Indian Ocean are distinguished by their superior plenty of wood 
and water: the air is more temperate, the fruits are more delicious, the 
animals and the human race more numerous: the fertility of the soil 
invites and rewards the toil of the husbandman; and the peculiar gifts 
of frankincense c and coffee have attracted in different ages the mer- 
chants of the world. If it be compared with the rest of the peninsula, 
this sequestered region may truly deserve the appellation of the happy; 
and the splendid colouring of fancy and fiction has been suggested by 
contrast and countenanced by distance. It was for this earthly paradise 
that nature had reserved her choicest favours and her most curious 
workmanship: the incompatible blessings of luxury and innocence were 
ascribed to the natives: die soil was impregnated with gold 7 and gems,

* The aromatics, especially the thus or frankincense, of Arabia, occupy the 
twelfth hook of Pliny. Our great poet {Paradise Lost, 1. rv.) introduces, in a 
simile, the spicy odours that are blown by the north-east wind from the 
Sabaean coast :

f Agatharchides affirms that lumps of pure gold were found from the size of 
att oHve to that of a nut; that iron was twice, and silver ten times, the value 
of gold (de Man Rubro, p. 60 [Hudson, Geogr. M., torn- i.]). These real or 
imaginary treasures are vanished ; and no gold-mines are at present known in 
Arabia (Ntebuhr, Description, p. 124). 



THE ROMAN. EMPIRE 59 

and both the land and sea were taught to exhale the odours of aromatic 
sweets. This division of the sandy, the stony, and the happy, so familiar 
to the Greeks and Latins, is unknown to the Arabians themselves; and 
it is singular enough, that a country whose language and inhabitants 
have ever been the same should scarcely retain a vestige of its ancient 
geography. The maritime districts of Bahrein and Otnan are opposite 
to the realm of Persia. The kingdom of Yemen displays the limits, or 
at least the situation, of Arabia Felix: the name oiNeged is extended 
over the inland space; and the birth of Mohammed has illustrated the 
province of Hejaz along the coast of the Red Sea. 8 

The measure of population is regulated by the means of subsistence; 
and the inhabitants of this vast peninsula might be out-numbered by the 
subjects of a fertile and industrious province. Along the shores of the 
Persian Gulf, of the ocean, and even of the Red Sea, the Ichthyophagi? 
or fish-eaters, continued to wander hi quest of their precarious food. In 
this primitive and abject state, which ill deserves the name of society, 
the human brute, without arts or laws, almost without sense or language, 
is poorly distinguished from the rest of the animal, creation. Generations 
and ages might roll away in silent oblivion, and the helpless savage 
was restrained from multiplying his race by the wants and pursuits which 
confined his existence to the narrow margin of the sea-coast. But in an 
early period of antiquity the great body of the Arabs had emerged from 
this scene of misery; and as the naked wilderness could not maintain 
a people of hunters, they rose at once to the more secure and plentiful 
condition of tie pastoral life. The same life is uniformly pursued by 
the roving tribes of the desert; and in the portrait of the modern 
JBedoweens we may trace the features of their ancestors, 10 who, in the 

'Consult, peruse, and study the Specimen Historiae Arabum of Pocock 
(Oxon. 1650, in 4to). The thirty pages of text and version are extracted from 
the Dynasties of Gregory Abulpharagius, which Pocock afterwards translated 
(Oxon. 1663, in 4*0) : the three hundred and fifty-eight notes form a classic 
and original work on the Arabian antiquities. 

[Hejaz means the "barrier" or "frontier," as lying between the southern 
and northern merchants, or, in other words, between Arabia Felix and Arabia 
Petraea. It is a mountainous district, and includes Medina as well as Mecca.

Arab and Druse at Home, 1907. O. S.] 

*Arrian remarks the Icnthyophagi of the coast of Hejaz (Periplus Maris 
Erythraei, p. 12) and beyond Aden (p. 15 [Hudson, Geogr. M., L i,]). It 
seems probable that the shores of the Red 'Sea (in the largest sense) were 
occupied by these savages in the time perhaps of Cyrus ; but I can hardly be- 
lieve that any cannibals were left among the savages in the reign of Justinian 
(Procop. de Bell. Persic. L i. c. 19 [t. i. p. 100, ed. Bonn]).

picture of the life of the Bedoweens, which may be illustrated from Niebnhr

age of Moses or Mohammed, dwelt under similar tents, and conducted 
their horses, and camels, and sheep to the same springs and the same 
pastures. Our toil is lessened, and our wealth is increased, by our 
dominion over the useful animals; and the Arabian shepherd had 
acquired the absolute possession of a faithful friend and a laborious 
slave. 11 Arabia, in the opinion of the naturalist, is the genuine and 
original country of the horse; the climate most propitious, not indeed 
to the size, but to the spirit and swiftness, of that generous animal. 
The merit of the Barb, the Spanish, and the English breed is derived 
from a mixture of Arabian blood: 12 the Bedoweens preserve, with super- 
stitious care, the honours and the memory of the purest race: the males 
are sold at a high price, but the females are seldom alienated; and the 
birth of a noble foal was esteemed among the tribes as a subject of joy 
and mutual- congratulation. These horses are educated in the tents, 
among the children of the Arabs, with a tender familiarity, which trains 
them in the habits of gentleness and attachment. They are accustomed 
only to walk and to gallop: their sensations are not blunted by the in- 
cessant abuse of the spur and the whip: their powers are reserved for 
the moments of flight and pursuit: but no sooner do they feel the touch 
of the hand or the stirrup, than they dart away with the swiftness of 
the wind; and if their friend be dismounted in the rapid career, they 
instantly stop till he has recovered his seat. In the sands of Africa and 
Arabia the camel is a sacred and precious gift. That strong and patient 
beast of burden can perform, without eating or drinking, a journey of 
several days; and a reservoir of fresh water is preserved in a large bag, 
a fifth stomach of the animal, whose body is imprinted with the marks 
of servitude: the larger breed is capable of transporting a weight of a 
thousand pounds; and the dromedary, of a lighter and more active frame, 
outstrips the fleetest courser in the race. Alive or dead, almost every part 
of the camel is serviceable to man: her milk is plentiful and nutritious: 
the young and tender flesh has the taste of veal: 10 a valuable salt is 
extracted from the urine: the dung supplies the deficiency of fuel; and 

Arabs, but never Bedaween. See Arab and Druse at Home, by the Rev. 
W. Ewing, MA. (1907), in which the whole question is treated by a ripe

*Read (it is no unpleasing task) the incomparable articles of the Horse 
and the Camel, in the Natural History of M. de Buffon. 

* For the Arabian horses, see D'Arvieux (p. 159-173) and Niebuhr (p. 142- 
144). At the end of the thirteenth century lie horses of Neged were esteemed 
sure-footed, those of Yemen strong and serviceable, those of Hejaz most noble. 
The horses of Europe, the tenth and last class, were generally despised as 
having too much body and too little spirit (D'Herbelot, Biblioth. Orient, 
p. 339) "- their strength was requisite to bear the weight of the knight and 
his armour. 

*Qui carnibus camelorum vesci solent odii tenaces sunt, was the opinion 
of an Arabian physician (Pocock, Specimen, p. 88). Mohammed himself, 
who was fond of milk, prefers the cow, and does not even mention the 
camel; but the diet of Mecca and Medina was already more luxurious 
(Gagnter, Vie de Mahomet, torn. Hi. p. 404). 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 61 

ihe long hair, which falls each year and is renewed, is coarsely manu- 
factured into the garments, the furniture, and the tents of the Bedoweens. 
In the rainy seasons they consume the rare and insufficient herbage of 
the desert: during the heats of summer and the scarcity of winter they 
remove their encampments to the sea-coast, the hills of Yemen y or the 
neighbourhood of the Euphrates, and have often extorted the dangerous 
licence of visiting the banks of the Nile and the villages of Syria and 
Palestine. The life of a wandering Arab is a life of danger and distress; 
and though sometimes, by rapine or exchange, he may appropriate the 
fruits of ^ industry, a private citizen in Europe is in the possession of 
more solid and pleasing luxury than the proudest emir who marches 
in the field at the head of ten thousand horse. 

Yet an essential difference may be found between the hordes of 
Scythia and the Arabian tribes; since many of the latter were collected 
into towns, and employed in the labours of trade and agriculture. A 
part of their time and industry was still devoted to the management of 
their cattle: they mingled, in peace and war, with their brethren of the 
desert; and the Bedoweens derived from their useful intercourse some 
supply of their wants, and some rudiments of art and knowledge. 
Among the forty-two cities of Arabia, 1 * enumerated by Abulfeda, the 
most ancient and populous were situate in the happy Yemen: the towers 
of Saana, 15 and the marvellous reservoir of Merab, ia were constructed 
by the kings of the Homerites; but their profane lustre was eclipsed by 
the prophetic glories of MEDINA," and MECCA," near the Red Sea, 

w Yet Martian of Heraclea (in Periplo, D. 16, in torn. i. Hudson, Minor 
Geograph.) reckons one hundred and sixty- four towns in Arabia Felix. The 
size of the towns might be small, the faith of the writer might be large. 

"It is compared by Abulfeda (in Hudson, torn. iii. p. 54) to Damascus, 
and is still the residence of the Imam of Yemen (Voyages de Niebuhr, torn, i, 
p. 331-342). Saana is twenty-four parasangs from Dafar (Abulfeda,. p. 51) 
and sixty-eight from Aden. (p. 53). 

ia Pocock, Specimen, p. 57 ; Geograph. Nubfensis, p. 52. Mariaba, or Merab, 
six miles in circumference, was destroyed by the legions of Augustus (Plin. 
Hist. Nat. vi. 32), and had not revived in the fourteenth century (Abulfed. 
Descript Arab. p. 58). 

"The name of city, Medina, was appropriated, /car* j&amp;xi??, to Yatreb (the 
latrippa of the Greeks), the seat of the prophet. The distances from Medina 
are reckoned by Abulfeda in stations, or days' journey of a caravan (p. 15) : 
to Bahrein, fifteen; to Bassora, eighteen; to Cufah, twenty; to Damascus 
or Palestine, twenty; to Cairo, twenty-five; to Mecca, ten; from Mecca to 
Saana (p. 52) or Aden, thirty; to Cairo, thirty-one days, or 412 hours 
(Shaw's Travels, p. 477) ; which, according to the estimate of D'Anville 
(Mesures Itineraires, p. 99), allows about twenty-five English miles for a 
day's journey. From the land of frankincense (Hadramaut, in Yemen, be- 
tween Aden and Cape Fartasch) to Gaza, in Syria, Pliny (Hist. Nat. xii. 32) 
computes sixty-five mansions of camels. These measures may assist fancy 
and elucidate facts. 

"Our notions of Mecca must be drawn from the Arabians (D'Herbelot, 
Bibliotheque Orientale, p. 368-371; Pocock, Specimen, p. 125-128; Abulfeda, 
p. 11-40). As no unbeliever is permitted to enter the city, our travellers 
are silent; and the short hints of Thevenot (Voyages du Levant, part f. 400)

and at the distance from each other of two hundred and seventy miles. 
The last of these holy places was known to the Greeks under the name 
of Macoraba; and the termination of the word is expressive of its great- 
ness, which has not indeed, in the most flourishing period, exceeded the 
size and populousness of Marseilles. Some latent motive, perhaps of 
superstition, must have impelled the founders in the choice of a most 
unpromising situation. They erected their habitations of mud or stone 
in a plain about two miles long and one mile broad, at the foot of three 
barren mountains: the soil is a rock; the water even of the holy well of 
Zemzem is bitter or brackish; the pastures are remote from the city; and 
grapes are transported above seventy miles from the gardens of Tayef . 
The fame and spirit of the Koreishites, who reigned in Mecca, were 
conspicuous among the Arabian tribes; but their ungrateful soil refused 
the labours of agriculture, and their position was favourable to the 
enterprises of trade. By the seaport of Gedda, at the distance only of 
forty miles, they maintained an easy correspondence with Abyssinia; 
and that Christian kingdom afforded the first refuge to the disciples of 
Mohammed. The treasures of Africa were conveyed over the peninsula 
to Gerrha or Katif, in the province of Bahrein, a city built, as it is said, 
of rock-salt, by the Chaldaean exiles; 10 and from thence, with the native 
pearls of the Persian Gulf, they were floated on rafts to the mouth of the 
Euphrates. Mecca, is placed almost at an equal distance, a month's 
journey, between Yemen on the right and Syria on the left hand. The 
former was the winter, the latter the summer, station of her caravans; 
and their seasonable arrival relieved the ships of India from the tedious 
and troublesome navigation of, the Red Sea. In the markets of Saana 
and Merab, in the harbours of Oman and Aden, the camels of the 
Koreishites were laden with a precious cargo of aromatics; a supply of 
corn and manufactures was purchased in the fairs of Bostra and Damas- 
cus; the lucrative exchange diffused plenty and riches in the streets of 
Mecca; and the noblest of her sons united the love of arms with the 
profession of merchandise. 20 

The perpetual independence of the Arabs has been the theme of praise 
among strangers and natives; and the arts of controversy transform 
this singular event into a prophecy and a miracle in favour of the 
posterity of IsmaeL 21 Some exceptions, that can neither be dissembled

nor eluded, render this mode of reasoning as indiscreet as it is super- 
fluous; the kingdom of Yemen has been successively subdued by the 
Abyssinians, the Persians, the sultans of Egypt, 22 and the Turks: 2 * the 
holy cities of Mecca and Medina have repeatedly bowed under a Scy- 
thian tyrant; and the Roman province of Arabia 24 embraced the 
peculiar wilderness in which Ismael and his sons must have pitched their 
tents in the face of their brethren. Yet these exceptions are temporary 
or local; the body of the nation has escaped the yoke of the most power* 
ful monarchies: the arms of Sesostris and Cyrus, of Pompey and Trajan, 
could never achieve the conquest of Arabia; the present sovereign of 
the Turks 25 may exercise a shadow of jurisdiction, but. his pride fa 
reduced to solicit the friendship of a people whom it is dangerous to 
provoke and fruitless to attack. The obvious causes of their freedom 
are inscribed on the character and country of the Arabs. Many ages 
before Mohammed, 26 their intrepid valour had been severely felt by theij 
neighbours in offensive and defensive war. The patient and active 
virtues of a soldier are insensibly nursed in the habits and discipline ol 
a pastoral life. The care of the sheep and camels is abandoned to the 
women of the tribe; but the martial youth, under the banner of the 
fcmir, is ever on horseback, and in the field, to practise the exercise of 
the bow, the javelin, and the scymetar. The long memory of their 
independence is the firmest pledge of its perpetuity, and succeeding 
generations are animated to prove their descent and to maintain their 
inheritance. Their domestic feuds are suspended on the approach of 
a common enemy; and in their last hostilities against the Turks, the

the Turks were expelled about the year 1630 (Niebuhr, p. 167, 168).

tine, the principal cities were Bostra and Petra, which dated their era frpni 
the year 105, when they were subdued by Palma, a lieutenant of Trajan 
(Dion Cassius, L Ixviii. [c. 14]). Petra was the capital of the Nabatihaean^ 
whose name is derived from the eldest of the sons of Ismael (Gen. xxv. 12^ 
etc., with the Commentaries of Jerom, Le Clerc, and Calmet). Justinian re- 
linquished a palm country of ten days' journey to the south of JElah (Procop, 
de Bell. Persic. 1. L c. 19 [t i. p. 101, ed. Bonn]), and the Romans main? 
tained a centurion and a custom-house (Arrian in Periplo Maris Erythraei, 
p. n, in Hudson, torn, i.) at a place (X&amp;m/ K&lt;fywj, Pagus Albus, Hawara) in 
the territory of Medina (D'Anville, Memoire sur 1'Egypte, p. 243). These 
real possessions, and some naval inroads of Trajan (Peripl. p. 14, 15)1 are 
magnified by history and medals into the Roman conquest of Arabia.

caravan of Mecca was attacked and pillaged by fourscore thousand of 
the confederates. When they advance to battle, the hope of victory is 
in the front; in the rear, the assurance of a retreat. Their horses and 
camels, who in eight or ten days can perform a march of four or five 
hundred miles, disappear before the conqueror; the secret waters of the 
desert elude his search; and his victorious troops are consumed with 
thirst, hunger, and fatigue in the pursuit of an invisible foe, who scorns 
his efforts, and safely reposes in the heart of the burning solitude. The 
arms and deserts of the Bedoweens are not only the safeguards of their 
own- freedom, but the barriers also of the happy Arabia, whose inhabi- 
tants, remote from war, are enervated by the luxury of the soil and 
climate. The legions of Augustus melted away in disease and lassi- 
tude; 27 and it is only by a naval power that the reduction of Yemen has 
been successfully attempted. When Mohammed erected his holy stand- 
ard, 28 that kingdom was a province of the Persian empire; yet seven 
princes of the Homerites still reigned in the mountains; and the vice- 
gerent of Chosroes was tempted to forget his distant country and his 
unfortunate master. The historians of the age of Justinian represent 
the state of the independent Arabs, who were divided by interest or 
affection in the long quarrel of the East: the tribe of Gassan was allowed 
to encamp on the Syrian territory: the princes of Hira were permitted to 
form a city about forty miles to the southward of the ruins of Babylon. 
Their service in the field was speedy and vigorous; but their friendship 
was venal, their faith inconstant, their enmity capricious: it was an 
easier task to excite than to disarm these roving barbarians; and, in 
the familiar intercourse of war, they learned to see and to despise the 
splendid weakness both of Rome and of Persia. From Mecca to the 
Euphrates, the Arabian tribes 28 were confounded by the Greeks and 
Latins under .the general appellation of SARACENS, 30 a name which every

Christian mouth has been taught to pronounce with terror and 
abhorrence. 

The slaves of domestic tyranny may vainly exult in their national 
independence: but the Arab is personally free; and he enjoys, in some 
degree, the benefits of society, without forfeiting the prerogatives of 
nature. In every tribe, superstition, or gratitude, or fortune has 
exalted a particular family above the heads of their equals. The digni- 
ties of sheick and emir invariably descend in this chosen race; but the 
order of succession is loose and precarious; and the most worthy or aged 
of the noble kinsmen are preferred to the simple though important 
office of composing disputes by their advice, and guiding valour by 
their example. Even a female of sense and spirit has been permitted 
to command the countrymen of Zenobia. 81 The momentary junction 
of several tribes produces an army: their more lasting union constitutes 
a nation: and the supreme chief, the emir of emirs, whose banner is 
displayed at their head, may deserve, in the eyes of strangers, the hon- 
ours of the kingly name- If the Arabian princes abuse their power, they 
are quickly punished by the desertion of their subjects, who had been 
accustomed to a mild and parental jurisdiction. Their spirit is free, 
their steps are unconfined, the desert is open, and the tribes and families 
are held . together by a mutual and voluntary compact. The softer 
natives of Yemen supported the pomp and majesty of a monarch; but 
if he could not leave his palace without endangering his life, 82 the active 
powers of government must have been devolved on his nobles and 
magistrates. The cities of Mecca and Medina present, in the heart of 
Asia, the form, or rather the substance, of a commonwealth. The 
grandfather of Mohammed, and his lineal ancestors, appear in foreign 
and domestic transactions as the princes of their country; but they 
reigned, like Pericles at Athens, or the Medici at Florence, by the opinion 
of their wisdom and integrity; their influence was divided with their 
patrimony; and the sceptre was transferred from the uncles of the 
prophet to a younger branch of the tribe of Koreish. On solemn oc- 
casions they convened the assembly of the people; and, since mankind 
must be either compelled or persuaded to obey, the use and reputation 
of oratory among the ancient Arabs is the clearest evidence of public

freedom. 33 But their simple freedom was of a very different cast from 
the nice and artificial machinery of the Greek and Roman republics, in 
which each member possessed an undivided share of the civil and politi- 
cal rights of the community. In the more simple state of the Arabs, 
the nation is free, because each of her sons disdains a base submission 
to the will of a master. His breast is fortified with the austere virtues 
of courage, patience, and sobriety; the love of independence prompts 
him to exercise the habits of self-command; and the fear of dishonour 
guards him from the meaner apprehension of pain, of danger, and of 
death. The gravity and firmness of the mind is conspicuous in his 
outward demeanour: his speech is slow, weighty, and concise; he is 
seldom provoked to laughter; his only gesture is that of stroking his 
beard, the venerable symbol of manhood; and the sense of his own 
importance teaches him to accost his equals without levity, and his 
superiors without awe/' 54 The liberty of the Saracens survived their 
conquests: the first caliphs indulged the bold and familiar language of 
their subjects: they ascended the pulpit to persuade and edify the 
congregation; nor was it before the seat of empire was removed to the 
Tigris that the Abbassides adopted the proud and pompous ceremonial 
of the Persian and Byzantine courts. 

In the study of nations and men we may observe the causes that 
render them hostile or friendly to each other, that tend to narrow or en- 
large, to mollify or exasperate, the social character. The separation of 
the Arabs from the rest of mankind has accustomed them to confound 
the ideas of stranger and enemy; and the poverty of the land has intro- 
duced a maxim of jurisprudence which they believe and practise to 
the present hour. They pretend that, in the division of the earth, the 
rich and fertile climates were assigned to the other branches of the 
human family; and that the posterity of the outlaw Ismael might re- 
cover, by fraud or force, the portion of inheritance of which he had been 
unjustly deprived. According to the remark of Pliny, the Arabian tribes 
are equally addicted to theft and merchandise: the caravans that 
traverse the desert are ransomed or pillaged; and their neighbours, 
since the remote times of Job and Sesostris, 85 have been the victims of 
their rapacious spirit. If a Bedoween discovers from afar a solitary 
traveller, he rides furiously against him, crying, with a loud voice, 
" Undress thyself, thy aunt (my wife) is without a garment." A ready

(Sephadius apud Pocock, Specimen, p. 161, 162). This gift of speech they 
Shared only with the Persians; and the sententious Arabs would probably 
have disdained the simple and sublime logic of Demosthenes* 

**I must remind the reader that D'Arvieux, D'Herbelot, and Niebuhr 
represent in the most lively colours the manners and government of the Arabs, 
which are illustrated by many incidental passages in the Life of Mahomet.

submission entitles him to mercy; resistance will provoke the aggressor, 
and his own blood must expiate the blood which he presumes to shed 
in legitimate defence. A single robber, or a few associates, are branded 
with their genuine name; but the exploits of a numerous band assume 
the character of lawful and honourable war. The temper of a people 
thus armed against mankind was doubly inflamed by the domestic 
licence of rapine, murder, and revenge. In the constitution of Europe, 
the right of peace and war is now confined to a small, and the actual 
exercise to a much smaller, list of respectable potentates; but each 
Arab, with impunity and renown, might point his javelin against the 
life of his countrymen. The union of the nation consisted only in 9 
vague resemblance of language and manners; and in each community the 
jurisdiction of the magistrate was mute and impotent. Of the time of 
ignorance which preceded Mohammed, seventeen hundred battles* are 
recorded by tradition: hostility was embittered with the rancour of 
civil faction: and the recital, in prose or verse, of an obsolete feud, was 
sufficient to rekindle the same passions among the descendants of the 
hostile tribes. In private life every man, at least every famLy, was 
the judge and avenger of its own cause. The nice sensibility of honour, 
which weighs the insult rather than the injury, sheds its deadly venom 
on the quarrels of the Arabs: the honour of their women, and of their 
beards, is most easily wdunded; an indecent action, a contemptuous 
word, can be expiated only by the blood of the offender; and such is 
their patient inveteracy, that they expect whole months and years the 
opportunity of revenge. A fine or compensation for murder is familiar 
to the barbarians of every -age: but in Arabia the kinsmen of the dead 
are at liberty to accept the atonement, or to exercise with their own 
hands the law of retaliation. The refined malice of the Arabs refuses 
even the head of the murderer, substitutes an innocent to the guilty 
person, and transfers the penalty to the best and most considerable of 
the race by whom they have been injured. If he falls by their hands, 
they are exposed in their turn to the danger of reprisals; the interest and 
principal of the bloody debt are accumulated: the individuals of cither 
family lead a life of malice and suspicion, and fifty years may sometimes 
elapse before the account of vengeance be finally settled. 87 This 
sanguinary spirit, ignorant of pity or forgiveness, has been moderated, 
however, by the maxims of honour, which require in every private 
encounter some decent equality of age and strength, of numbers and 

"Or, according to another account, 1200 (D'Herbelot, Bibliotheque Oi&gt; 
entale, p. 75) : the two historians who wrote of the Ayam al Arab, the battles 
of the Arabs, lived in -the ninth and tenth century. The famous war of 
Dahes and Gabrah was occasioned by two horses, lasted forty years, and 
ended in a proverb (Pocock, Specimen, p. 48). 

" The modern theory and practice of the Arabs in the revenge of murder 
are described by Niebuhr (Description, p. 26-31). The harsher features of 
antiquity may be traced in the Koran, c. 2, p. 20, c i7 P- 230, with 
Observations. 



68 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

weapons. An annual festival of two, perhaps of four, months, was 
observed by the Arabs before the time of Mohammed, during which 
their swords were religiously sheathed both in foreign and domestic 
hostility; and this partial truce is more strongly expressive of the habits 
of anarchy and warfare. 88 

But the spirit of rapine and revenge was attempered by the milder 
influence of trade and literature. The solitary peninsula is encompassed 
by the most civilised nations of the ancient world; the merchant is the 
friend of mankind; and the annual caravans imported the first seeds of 
knowledge and politeness into the cities and even the camps of the 
desert. Whatever may be the pedigree of the Arabs, their language 
is derived from the same original stock with the Hebrew, the Syriac, 
and the Chaldaean tongues; the independence of the tribes was marked 
by their peculiar dialects; 39 but each, after their own, allowed a just 
preference to the pure and perspicuous idiom of Mecca. In Arabia, as 
well as in Greece, the perfection of language outstripped the refinement 
of manners; and her speech could diversify the fourscore names of honey, 
the two hundred of a serpent, the five hundred of a lion, the thousand 
of a sword, at a time when this copious dictionary was intrusted to the 
memory of an illiterate people. The monuments of the Homerites were 
inscribed with an obsolete and mysterious character; but the Cufic 
letters, the groundwork of the present alphabet, were invented on the 
banks of the Euphrates; and the recent invention was taught at Mecca 
by a stranger who settled in that city after the birth of Mohammed. 
The arts of grammar, of metre, and of rhetoric were unknown to the 
free-born eloquence of the Arabians; but their penetration was sharp, 
their fancy luxuriant, their wit strong and sententious, 40 and their 
more elaborate compositions were addressed with energy and effect to 
the minds of their hearers. The genius and merit of a rising poet was 
celebrated by the applause of his own and the kindred tribes. A 
solemn banquet was prepared, and a chorus of women, striking their 

38 Procopius (de Bell. Persic. 1. i. c. 16) places the two holy months about 
the summer solstice. The Arabians consecrate four months of the year the 
first, seventh, eleventh, and twelfth; and pretend that, in a long series of ages, 
the truce was infringed only four or six times (Sale's Preliminary Discourse, 

g, 147-150, and Notes on the ninth chapter of the Koran, p. 154, etc.; Casiri, 
iblioth. Hispano-Arabica, torn. ii. p. 20, 21). 

"Arrian, in the second century, remarks (in Periplo Maris Erythraei, p. 12 
[Hudson, Geog. M,, t i.]) the partial or total difference of the dialects of 
the Arabs. Their language and letters are copiously treated by Pocock 
(Specimen, p. 150-154), Casiri (Biblioth. Hispano-Arabica, torn. i. p. I, 
83, 292; torn. ii. p. 25, etc.), and Niebuhr (Description de 1'Arabie, p. 72-86),

*A familiar tale in Voltaire's Zadig (le Chien et le Cheval) is related to 
prove the natural sagacity of the Arabs (D'Herbelot, Biblioth. Orient, p. 120, 
121 ; Gagmer, Vie de Mahomet, torn. i. p. 37-46) ; but D'Arvieux, or rather 
La Roque (Voyage de Palestine, p. 92), denies the boasted superiority of 
the Bedoweens. The one hundred and sixty-nine sentences of Ali (trans- 
lated by Ockley, London, 1718) afford a just and favourable specimen cxf 
Arabian wit.

tymbals, and displaying the pomp of their nuptials, sung in the 
presence of their sons and husbands the felicity of their native tribe 
that a champion had now appeared to vindicate their rights that a 
herald had raised his voice to immortalise their renown. The distant 
or hostile tribes resorted to an annual fair, which was abolished by the 
fanaticism of the first Moslems a national assembly that must have 
contributed to refine and harmonise the barbarians. Thirty days were 
employed in the exchange, not only of corn and wine, but of eloquence 
and poetry. The prize was disputed by the generous emulation of the 
bards; the victorious performance was deposited in the archives of 
princes and emirs; and we may read in our own language the seven 
original poems which were inscribed in letters of gold, and suspended 
in the temple of Mecca. 41 The Arabian poets were the historians and 
moralists of the age; and if they sympathised with the prejudices, they 
inspired and crowned the virtues, of their countrymen. The indissoluble 
union of generosity and valour was the darling theme of their song; 
and when they pointed their keenest satire against a despicable race, 
they affirmed, in the bitterness of reproach, that the men knew not how 
to give, nor the women to deny.* 2 The same hospitality, which was 
practised by Abraham, and celebrated by Homer, is still renewed in the 
camps of the Arabs. The ferocious Bedoweens, the terror of the desert, 
embrace, without inquiry or hesitation, the stranger who dares to 
confide in their honour and to enter their tent. His treatment is kind 
and respectful: he shares the wealth or the poverty of his host; and, 
after a needful repose, he is dismissed on his way with thanks, with 
blessings, and perhaps with gifts. The heart and hand are more largely 
expanded by the wants of a brother or a friend; but the heroic acts that 
could deserve the public applause must have surpassed the narrow 
measure of discretion and experience. A dispute had arisen, who among 
the citizens of Mecca was entitled to the prize of generosity; and a 
successive application was made to the three who were deemed most 
worthy of the trial. Abdallah, the son of Abbas, had undertaken a 
distant journey, and his foot was in the stirrup, when he heard the 
voice of a suppliant, " son of the uncle of the apostle of God, I am 
a traveller, and in distress 1 " He instantly dismounted to present the 
pilgrim with his camel, her rich caparison, and a purse of four thousand 
pieces of gold, accepting only the sword, either for its intrinsic value, 
or as the gift of an honoured kinsman. The servant of Kais informed 
the second suppliant that his master was asleep: but he immediately 
added, " Here is a purse of seven thousand pieces of gold (it is all we

have in the house), and here is an order that will entitle you to a camel 
and a slave;" the master, as soon as he awoke, praised and enfranchised 
his faithful steward, with a gentle reproof, that by respecting his 
slumbers he had stinted his bounty. The third of these heroes, the 
blind Arabah, at the hour of prayer, was supporting his steps on the 
shoulders of two slaves. " Alasl " he replied, " my coffers are empty! 
but these you may sell; if you refuse, I renounce them." At these words, 
pushing away the youths, he groped along the wall with his staff. The 
character of Hatem is the perfect model of Arabian virtue: 43 he was 
brave and liberal, an eloquent poet, and a successful robber: forty 
camels were roasted at his hospitable feasts; and at the prayer of a 
suppliant enemy he restored both the captives and the spoil. The free- 
dom of his countrymen disdained the laws of justice; they proudly 
indulged the spontaneous impulse of pity and benevolence. 
The religion of the Arabs, 44 as well as of the Indians, consisted in the 




the visible iiriage of a Deity: 
philosophic, or even a vulgar, eye the idea of boundless space: the 
character of eternity is marked on these solid globes, that seem incapable 
of corruption or decay: the regularity of their motions may. be ascribed 
to a principle of reason or instinct; and their real or imaginary influence 
encourages the vain belief that the earth and its inhabitants are the 
object of their peculiar care. The science of astronomy was cultivated 
at Babylon; but the school of the Arabs was a clear firmament and a 
naked plain. In their nocturnal marches they steered by the guidance 
of the stars,' their names, and order, and daily station were familiar to 
the curiosity and devotion of the Bedoween; and he was taught by 
experience to divide in twenty-eight parts the zodiac of the moon, and 
to bless the constellations who refreshed with salutary rains the thirst 
of the desert. The reign of the heavenly orbs could not be extended 
beyond the visible sphere; and some metaphysical powers were neces- 
sary to sustain the transmigration of souls and the resurrection of 
bodies: a camel was left to perish on the grave, that he might serve his 
master in another life; and the invocation of departed spirits implies 
that they were still endowed with consciousness and power. I am igno- 
.rant, and I am careless, of the blind mythology of the barbarians of the 
local deities, of the stars, the air, and the earth, of their sex or titles,

p. iiS; Caab and Hesnus (Pocock, Specimen, p. 43, 46, 48) were likewise 
conspicuous for their liberality; and the latter is elegantly praised by an 
Arabian poet: "Videbis eum cum accesseris exultantem, ac si dares illi quod 
ab illo petis." 

44 Whatever caa now be known of the idolatry of the ancient Arabians 
may be found in Pocock (Specimen, p, 89-136, 163, 164). His profound 
erudition is more clearly and concisely interpreted by Sale (Preliminary Dis- 
course, p. 14-24) ,- and Assemanni (Biblioth. Orient, torn. iv. p. 580-590) has 
added some valuable remarks.

their attributes or subordination. Each tribe, each family, each inde- 
pendent warrior, created and changed the rites and the object of his 
fantastic worship; but the nation, in every age, has bowed to the 
religion as well as to the language of Mecca. The genuine antiquity 
the CAABA ascends beyond the Christian era: in describing the 
coast of the Red Sea the "Greek historian Diodorus 45 has remarked, 
between the Thamudites and the Sabaeans, a famous temple, whose 
superior sanctity was revered by all the Arabians; the linen or silken 
veil, which is annually renewed by the Turkish emperor, was first 
offered by a pious king of the Homerites, who reigned seven hundred 
years before the time of Mohammed. 46 A tent or a cavern might suffice 
for the worship of the savages, but an edifice of stone and day has been 
erected in its place; and the art and power of the monarchs of the East 
have been confined to the simplicity of the original model. 47 A spacious 
portico encloses the quadrangle of the Caaba a square chapel twenty- 
four cubits long, twenty-three broad, and twenty-seven high: a door 
and a window admit the light; the double roof is supported by three 
pillars of wood; a spout (now of gold) discharges the rain-water, and 
the well Zemzem is protected by a dome from accidental pollution. 
The tribe of Koreish, by fraud or force, had acquired the custody of 
the Caaba: the sacerdotal office devolved through four lineal descents 
to the grandfather of Mohammed; and the family of the Hashemites, 
from whence he sprung, was the most respectable and sacred in the eyes 
of their country. 48 The precincts of Mecca enjoyed the rights of sanc-

Sicul. torn. L 1. iii. [c. 43] p. 211). The character and position are so correctly 
apposite, that I am surprised how this curious passage should have been read 
without notice or application. Yet this famous temple had been overlooked 
by Agatharchides (de Man Rubro, p. 58. in Hudson, torn, i.), whom Diodorus 
copies in the rest of the description. Was the Sicilian more knowing than 
the Egyptian? Or was the Caaba built between the years of Rome 650 and 
746, the dates of their respective histories? (Dodwell, in Dissert, ad torn. L 
Hudson, p. 72; Fabricius, Biblioth. Graec. torn. ii. p. 770). 

[Mr. Forster (Historical Geography of Arabia) has raised an objection fatal 
to this hypothesis of Gibbon. The temple, situated in the country of the 
Banizomeneis, was not between the Thamudites and Sabaeans, but higher up 
than the coast inhabited by the former. Mr. Forster would place it as far 
north as Moilah. I am not quite satisfied that this will agree with the whole 
description of Diodorus. O. S.] 

48 Pocock, Specimen, p. 60, 61. From the death of Mohammed we ascend 
to 68. from his birth to 129, years before the Christian era. The veil or 
curtain, which is now of silk and gold, was no more than a piece of Egyptian 
linen (Abulfeda, in Vit. Mohammed, c. 6, p. 14 [ed. Gagnier, Oxon. 1723]). 

47 The original plan of the Caaba (which is servilely copied in Sale, the 
Universal History, etc.) was a Turkish draught, which Reland (de Religions 
Mohammedica, p. 113-123) has corrected and explained from the best au- 
thorities. For the description and legend of the Caaba, consult Pocock 
(Specimen, p. 115-122), the Bibliotheque Orientale of D'Herbelot (Caaba, 
Hagiar, Zemzem, etc.), and Sale (Preliminary Discourse, p. 114-122).

tuary; and in the last month of each year the city and the temple were 
crowded with a long train of pilgrims, who presented their vows and 
offerings in the house of God. The same rites which are now accom- 
plished by the faithful Musulman were invented and practised by the 
superstition of the idolaters. At an awful distance they cast away 
their garments: seven times with hasty steps they encircled the Caaba, 
and kissed the black stone: seven times they visited and adored the 
adjacent mountains: seven times they threw stones into the valley of 
Mina: and the pilgrimage was achieved, as at the present hour, by a 
sacrifice of sheep and camels, and the burial of their hair and nails in 
the consecrated ground. Each tribe either found or introduced in the 
Caaba their domestic worship: the temple was adorned, or defiled, with 
three hundred and sixty idols of men, eagles, lions, and antelopes; and 
most conspicuous was the statue of Hebal, of red agate, holding in his 
hand seven arrows without heads or feathers, the instruments and 
symbols of profane divination. But this statue was a monument of 
Syrian arts: the devotion of the ruder ages was content with a pillar 
or a tablet; and the rocks of the desert were hewn into gods or altars 
in imitation of the black stone 40 of Mecca, which is deeply tainted with 
the reproach of an idolatrous origin. From Japan to Peru the use of 
sacrifice has universally prevailed; and .the votary has expressed his 
gratitude or fear by destroying or consuming, in honour of the god% 
the dearest and most precious of their gifts. The life of a man 50 
is the most precious oblation to deprecate a public calamity: the altars 
of Phoenicia and Egypt, of Rome and Carthage, have been polluted with 
human gore: the cruel practice was long preserved among the Arabs; 
in the third century a boy was annually sacrificed by the tribe of the 
Dumatians; 51 and a royal captive was piously slaughtered by the prince 
of the Saracens, the ally and soldier of the emperor Justinian. 02 A

Syria and Greece, so renowned in sacred and profane antiquity (Euseb. Praep

parent who drags his son to the altar exhibits the most painful and sub- 
lime effort of fanaticism: the deed or the intention was sanctified by the 
example of saints and heroes; and the father of Mohammed himself was 
devoted by a rash vow, and hardly ransomed for the equivalent of a 
.hundred camels. In the time of ignorance the Arabs, like the Jews and 
Egyptians, abstained from the taste of swine's flesh ; cs they circum- 
cised 8 * their children at the age of puberty: the same customs, without 
the censure or the precept of the Koran, have been silently transmitted 
to their posterity and proselytes. It has been sagaciously conjectured 
that the artful legislator indulged the stubborn prejudices of his country- 
men. It is more simple to believe that he adhered to the habits and 
opinions of his youth, without foreseeing that a practice congenial to 
the climate of Mecca might become useless or inconvenient on the bank* 
of the Danube or the Volga. 

Arabia was free: the adjacent kingdoms were shaken by the storms of 
conquest and tyranny, and the persecuted sects fled to the happy land 
where they might profess what they thought, and practise what they 
professed. The religions of the Sabians and Magians, of the Jews and 
Christians, were disseminated from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea. 
In a remote period of antiquity Sabianism was diffused over Asia by 
the science of the Chaldaeans 55 and the arms of the Assyrians. From 
the observations of two thousand years the priests and astronomers of 
Babylon 56 deduced the eternal laws of nature and providence. They 
adored the seven gods, or angels, who directed the course of the seven 
planets, and shed their irresistible influence on the earth. The attributes

twenty-four constellations of the northern and southern hemisphere,

than a fact (Gagnier, Vie de Mahomet, torn. i. p. 82-84). 

"Suillis carnibus abstinent, says Solinus (Polyhistor. c. 33), who copies 
Pliny (1. viii. c. 78) in the strange supposition that hogs cannot live in Arabia. 
The Egyptians were actuated by a natural and superstitious horror for 
that unclean beast (Marsham, Canon, p. 205). The old Arabians likewise 
practised, post coitum, the rite of ablution (Herodot. 1. i. c. 189), which is 
sanctified by the Mohammedan law (Reland, p. 75, etc.; Chardin, or rather 
the Mollah of Shah Abbas, torn. iv. p. 71, etc.). 

"The Mohammedan doctors are not fond of the subject; yet they hold 
circumcision necessary to salvation, and even pretend that Mohammed was 
miraculously born without a foreskin (Pocock, Specimen, p. 319, 320; Sale's 
Preliminary Discourse, p. 106, 107). 

85 Diodorus Siculus (torn. i. 1. ii. [c. 29 sqq.] p. 142-145) has cast on their 
religion the curious but superficial glance of a Greek. Their astronomy 
would be far more valuable; they had looked through the telescope of reason, 
since they could doubt whether the sun were in the number of the planets 
or of the fixed stars.

were represented by images and talismans; the seven days of the week 
were dedicated to their respective deities; the Sabians prayed thrice each 
day; and the temple of the moon at Haran was the term of their pil- 
grimage. 67 But the flexible genius of their faith was always ready 
either to teach or to learn: in the tradition of the creation, the deluge, 
and the patriarchs, they held a singular agreement with their Jewish 
captives; they appealed to the secret books of Adam, Seth, and Enoch; 
and a slight infusion of the Gospel has transformed the last remnant 
of the Polytheists into the Christians of St. John, in the territory of 
Bassora. 58 The altars of Babylon were overturned by the Magians; 
but the injuries of the Sabians were revenged by the sword of Alexander; 
Persia groaned above five hundred years under a foreign yoke; and the 
purest disciples of Zoroaster escaped from the contagion of idolatry, 
and breathed with their adversaries the freedom of the desert. 60 Seven 
hundred years before the death of Mohammed the Jews were settled 
in Arabia; and a far greater multitude was expelled from the Holy 
Land in the wars of Titus and Hadrian. The industrious exiles aspired 
to liberty and power: they erected synagogues in the cities, and castles 
in the wilderness; and their Gentile converts were confounded with the 
children of Israel, whom they resembled in the outward mark of cir- 
cumcision. The Christian missionaries were still more active and 
successful: the Catholics asserted their universal reign; the sects whom 
they oppressed successively retired beyond the limits of the Roman 
empire; the Marcionites and Manichaeans dispersed their fantastic 
opinions and apocryphal gospels; the churches of Yemen, and the 
princes of Hira and Gassan, were instructed in a purer creed by the 
Jacobite and Nestorian bishops. 00 The liberty of choice was presented 
to the tribes: each Arab was free to elect or to compose his private

of an ignorant people, afraid and ashamed to disclose their secret traditions.

religion; and the rude superstition of his house was mingled with the 
sublime theology of saints and philosophers. A fundamental article oi 
faith was inculcated by the consent of the learned strangers; the exist- 
ence of one supreme God, who is exalted above the powers of heaven 
and earth, but who has often revealed himself to mankind by the 
ministry of his angels and prophets, and whose grace or justice has 
interrupted, by seasonable miracles, the order of nature. The most 
rational of the Arabs acknowledged his power, though they neglected 
his worship; 81 and it was habit rather than conviction that still attached 
them to the relics of idolatry. The Jews and Christians were the 
people of the Book; the Bible was already translated into the Arabic 
language, 03 and the volume of the Old Testament was accepted by the 
concord of these implacable enemies. In the story of the Hebrew patri- 
archs the Arabs were pleased to discover the fathers of their nation. 
They applauded the birth and promises of Ismael; revered the faith 
and virtue of Abraham; traced his pedigree and their own to the creation 
of the first man, and imbibed with equal credulity the prodigies of the 
holy text, and the dreams and traditions of the Jewish rabbis. 

The base and plebeian origin of Mohammed is an unskilful calumny 
of the Christians, 68 who exalt instead of degrading the merit of theii 
adversary. His descent from Ismael was a national privilege or fable; 
but if the first steps of the pedigree 64 are dark and doubtful, he could 

61 In their offerings it was a maxim to defraud God for the profit of the 
idol not a more potent, but a more irritable, patron (Pocock, Specimen, 
p. 108, 109). 

08 Our versions now extant, whether Jewish or Christian, appear more 
recent than the Koran; but the existence of a prior translation may be fairly 
inferred i. From the perpetual practice of the synagogue, of expounding 
the Hebrew lesson by a paraphrase in the vulgar tongue of the country. 
2. From the analogy of the Armenian, Persian, ^Ethiopic versions expressly 
quoted by the fathers of the fifth century, who assert that the Scriptures 
were translated into all the barbaric languages (Walton, Prolegomena ad 
Biblia Polyglot, p. 34, 93-97 ; Simon, Hist Critique du V. et du N. Testament, 
torn. i. p. 180, 181, 282-286, 293, 305, 306, torn. iv. p. 206).

"Abulfeda (in Vit. Mohammed, c. i, 2) and Gagnier (Vie de Mahomet, 
p. 25-97) describe the popular and approved genealogy of the prophet At 
Mecca, I would not dispute its authenticity: at Lausanne, I will venture to 
observe I. That, from Ismael to Mohammed, a period of 2500 years, they 
reckon thirty, instead of seventy-five, generations. 2. That the modern Bedo- 
weens are ignorant of their history, and careless of their pedigree (Voyage 
de D'Arvieux, p. 100, 103). 

[According to the usually received tradition, Koreish was originally an 
epithet conferred upon Fihr (born about A.D. 200), who was the ancestor, 
at the distance of eight generations, of the famous Kussai mentioned in 
the next note. Sprenger, however, maintains that the tribe of Koreish was 
first formed by Kussai, and that the members of the new tribe called them-

produce many generations of pure and genuine nobility: he sprung from 
the tribe of Koreish and the family of Hashem, the most illustrious of 
the Arabs, the princes of Mecca, and the hereditary guardians of the 
Caaba. 05 The grandfather of Mohammed was Abdol Motalleb, the son 
of Hashem, a wealthy and generous citizen, who relieved the distress of 
famine with the supplies of commerce. Mecca, which had been fed 
by the liberality of the father, was saved by the courage of a son. The 
kingdom of Yemen was subject to the Christian princes of Abyssinia: 
their vassal Abrahah was provoked by an insult to avenge the honour 
of the cross; and the holy city was invested by a train of elephants 
and an army of Africans. A treaty was proposed; and, in the 
first audience, the grandfather of Mohammed demanded the restitution 
of his cattle. " And why," said Abrahah, " do you not rather implore 
my clemency in favour of your temple, which I have threatened to 
destroy? " " Because/' replied the intrepid chief, " the cattle is my 
own; the Caaba belongs to the gods, and they will defend their house 
from injury and sacrilege." The want of provisions, or the valour of 
the Koreish, compelled the Abyssinians to a disgraceful retreat: their 
discomfiture has been adorned with a miraculous flight of birds, who 
showered down stones on the heads of the infidels; and the deliverance 
was long commemorated by the era of the elephant. 06 The glory of 
Abdol Motalleb was crowned with domestic happiness; his life was 
prolonged to the age of one hundred and ten years; and he became the 
father of six daughters and thirteen sons. His best beloved Abdallah 
was the most beautiful and modest of the Arabian youth; and in the 

selves the children of Fihr as a symbol of unity. He regards Fihr as ,a 
mythical personage. 0. S.] 

"[Kussai (born about A.D. 400), great-grandfather of Abdol Motalleb, 
and consequently fifth in the ascending fine from Mohammed, obtained 
supreme power at Mecca. His office and privileges were to supply the 
numerous pilgrims with food and fresh water, the latter a rare article at 
Mecca; to conduct the business of the temple; and to preside in the senate 
or council. His revenues were a tenth of all merchandise brought to Mecca. 
After the death of Kussai these offices became divided among his descendants ; 
and, though the branch from which Mohammed sprang belonged to the 
reigning line, yet his family, especially after the death of his grandfather, 
had but little to do with the actual government of Mecca. 0. S.] 

M The seed of this history, or fable, is contained in the cvth chapter of 
the Koran; and Gagm'er (in Praefat ad Vit. Moham. p. 18, etc.) has translated 
the historical narrative of Abuifeda, which may be illustrated from D'Herbe- 
lot (Biblioth. Orientale, p. 12) and Pocock (Specimen, p. 64). Pritfeaux 
(Life of Mahomet, p. 48) calls it a lie of the coinage of Mohammed; but 
Sale (Koran, p. 501-503), who is half a Musulman, attacks the inconsistent 
faith of the Doctor for believing the miracles of the Delphic Apollo. Maracci 
(Alcoran, torn. i. part ii. p. 14; torn. ii. p. 823) ascribes the miracle to the 
devil, and extorts from the Mohammedans the confession that God would 
not have defended against the Christians the idols of the Caaba. 

[The apparent miracle which caused the retreat from the Hejaz was nothing 
else than the smallpox which broke out in the army of Abrahah. This seems 
to have been the first appearance of the smaltoox in Arabia. Sprenger, Lift

first night, when he consummated his marriage with Amina, of the 
noble race of the Zahrites, two hundred virgins are said to have expired 
of jealousy and despair. Mohammed, 67 the only son of Abdallah and 
Ainina, 68 was born at Mecca, four years after the death of Justinian, 
and two months after the defeat of the Abyssinians, 69 whose victory 
would have introduced into the Caaba the religion of the Christians. 
In his early infancy 70 he was "deprived of his father, his mother, and 
his grandfather; his uncles were strong and numerous; and, in the 
division of the inheritance, the orphan's share was reduced to fiv* 
camels and an Ethiopian maid-servant. 71 At home and abroad, in 

* 7 [Mohammed means "the praised," the name given to him by his grand- 
father on account of the favourable omen attending his birth. When Amina 
had given birth to the prophet, she sent for his grandfather, and related to 
him that she had seen in a dream a light proceeding from her body which 
illuminated the palaces of Bostra. We learn from Sir W. Muir and Burck- 
hardt that among the Arabs a name is given to the infant immediately on its 
birth. The name is derived from some trifling accident or from some 
object which had struck the fancy of the mother or any of the women present 
at the child's birth. 0. S.] 

88 [Amina, the mother of Mohammed, was of Jewish birth. Sprenger, on 
the other hand, says she was a Koreishite, and the daughter of Wahab, an 
elder of the Zohrah family. 0. S.] 

69 The safest eras of Abulfeda (in Vit. c. i. p. 2), of Alexander, or the 
Greeks, 882, of Bocht Naser, or Nabonassar, 1316, equally lead us to the year 
569. The old Arabian calendar is too dark and uncertain to support the 
Benedictines (Art de verifier les Dates, p. 15), who, from the day of the 
month and week, deduce a new mode of calculation, and remove the birth 
of Mohammed to the year of Christ 570, the loth of November.' Yet this 
date would agree with the year 882 of the Greeks, which is -assigned by 
Elmacin (Hist. Saracen, p. 5) and Abulpharagius (Dynast, p. 101 ; and Errata, 
Pocock's version). While we refine our chronology, it is possible that the 
illiterate prophet was ignorant of his own age. 

[The latest authority (Mr. P. de Lacy Johnstone, MA.) states that Mo- 
hammed was born in 571, on a Monday in the first half of Raby* I. He 
also comes to the conclusion that he died at the age of sixty-three years. 
All good Mussulmans celebrate the birth of Mohammed on the I2th of 
Raby' I., and for this day almost all traditions agree. But that day was a 
Thursday in 571. But there are reasons' for believing that the Meccan year 
was originally a lunar one, and continued so until the beginning of the fifth 
century, when in imitation of the Jews it was turned by the intercalation 
of a month at the close of every third year into a luni-solar one. Hence it 
follows that all calculations made up to the end of Mohammed's life must 
be made in luni-solar years and not in lunar years, involving a yearly dif- 
ference of ten days. See Calcutta Review, No. 41, p. 49 ; De Lacy Johnstone's 
" Mohammed " in World's Epoch-makers Series. 0. S.] 

70 [The father of Mohammed died two months before his birth : and to 
the ill state of health which the shock of this premature bereavement entailed 
on the widow, Sprenger, Muir, and Johnstone all attribute the sickly and 
nervous temperament of the prophet. His mother died in his seventh year, 
his grandfather two years later. O. S.] 

71 [His poverty was due, however, not to the injustice of his uncles, but, 
as De Lacy Johnstone points out, to his own inactivity and unfitness for the 
ordinary duties of life. He had the same patrimony with which his father 
began life, viz., a house, five camels, a flock of sheep, and a female slave, 
yet he was reduced to the necessity of pasturing sheep, an occupation consid-

peace and war, Abu Taleb, the most respectable of his uncles, was the 
guide and guardian of his youth; in his twenty-fifth year he entered into 
ihe service of Cadijah, a rich and noble widow of Mecca, who soon 
rewarded his fidelity with the gift of her hand and fortune. The mar- 
riage contract, in the simple style of antiquity, recites the mutual love 
of Mohammed and Cadijah; describes him as the most accomplished 
of the tribe of Koreish; and stipulates a dowry of twelve ounces of gold 
and twenty camels, which was supplied by the liberality of his uncle. 72 
By this alliance the son of Abdallah was restored to the station of his 
ancestors; and the judicious matron was content with his domestic 
virtues, till, in the fortieth year of his age, 73 he assumed the title of a 
prophet, and proclaimed the religion of the Koran. 

According to the tradition of his companions, Mohammed 74 was 
distinguished by the beauty of his person, an outward gift which is 
seldom despised, except by those to whom it has been refused. Before 
he spoke, the orator engaged on his side the affections of a public or 
private audience. They applauded his commanding presence, his 
majestic aspect, his piercing eye, his gracious smile, his flowing beard, 
his countenance that painted every sensation of the soul, and his ges- 
tures that enforced each expression of the tongue. 75 In the familiar 

ered by the Arabs as peculiarly humiliating. Cf* Weil's Mahomet. The 
same author adds that Mohammed afterwards entered into the linen trade 
in partnership with a man named Saib. 0. S.]

ra The private life of Mohammed, ^rom his birth to his mission, is preserved 
by Abulfeda (in Vit c. 3-7), and the Arabian writers of genuine or apocryphal 
note, who are alleged by Hottinger (Hist. Orient, p. 204-211), Maracci (torn. i. 
p. 10-14), and Gagnier (Vie de Mahomet, torn. i. p. 97-134). 

"Abulfeda, in Vit. c. 65, 66; Gagnier, Vie de Mahomet, torn. iii. p. 272- 
289; the best traditions of the person and conversation of the prophet are 
derived from Ayesha, Ali, and Abu Horaira (Gagnier, torn. ii. p. 267; Ockley's 
Hist of the Saracens, vol. ii. p. 149), surnamed the Father of a Cat. who 
died m the year 59 of the Hegira. 

[The following is the description of Mohammed's person given by Dr. 
Sprenger: ' He was of middle size, had broad shoulders, a wide chest, 
and large bones, and he was fleshy but not stout. The immoderate size of 
his head was partly disguised by the long locks of hair, which in slight 
curls came down nearly to the lobes of his ears. His oval face, though 
tawny, was rather fair for an Arab, but neither pale nor high coloured. 
The forehead was broad, and his fine and long, but narrow, eyebrows were 
separated by a vein, which you could see throbbing if he was angry. Under 
(ong eyelashes sparkled bloodshot black eyes through wide-slit eyelids. His 
aose was large, prominent, and slightly hooked, and the tip of it seemed to

offices of life he scrupulously adhered to the grave and ceremonious 
politeness of his country: his respectful attention to the rich and power* 
ful was dignified by his condescension and affability to the poorest 
citizens of Mecca: the frankness of his manner concealed the artifice of 
his views; and the habits of courtesy were imputed to personal friendship 
or universal benevolence. His memory was capacious and retentive; 
his wit easy and social; his imagination sublime; his judgment dear, 
rapid, and decisive. He possessed the courage both of thought and 
action; and, although his designs might gradually expand with his 
success, the first idea which he entertained of his divine mission bears 
the stamp of an original and superior genius. The son of Abdallah was 
educated in the bosom of the noblest race, in the use of the purest 
dialect of Arabia; and the fluency of his speech was corrected and en- 
hanced by the practice of discreet and seasonable silence. With these 
powers of eloquence, Mohammed was an illiterate barbarian: his youth 
had never been instructed in the arts of reading and writing ; TC the 
common ignorance exempted him from shame or reproach, but he was 
reduced to a narrow circle of existence, and deprived of those faithful 
mirrors which reflect to our mind the minds of sages and heroes. Yet 
the book of nature and of man was open to his view; and some fancy has 

be turned up, but was not so in reality. The mouth was wide, and he 
had a good set of teeth, and the fore-teeth were asunder. His beard rose 
from the cheek-bones and came down to the collar-bone; he clipped his 
nmstachios, but did not shave them. He stooped, and was slightly hump- 
backed. His gait was careless, and he walked fast but heavily, as if he 
were ascending a hill; and if he looked back, he turned his whole body, 
The mildness of his countenance gained him the confidence of every one; 
but he could not look straight into a man's face; he turned his eyes usually 
outwards." 0. SJ 

76 Those who believe that Mohammed could read or write are incapable 
of reading what is written, with another pen, in the Suras, or chapters of 
the Koran, vii. xxix. xcvi. These texts, and the tradition of the Sonna, 
are admitted, without doubt, by Abulfeda (in Vit. c. 7), Gagnier (Not. ad 
Abulfed. p. 15), Pocock (Specimen, p. 151), Reland (de Religione Mohatn- 
medica, p. 236), and Sale (Preliminary Discourse, p. 42). Mr. White, almost 
alone, denies the ignorance, to accuse the imposture, of the prophet His 
arguments are far from satisfactory. Two short trading journeys to the 
fairs of Syria were surely not sufficient to infuse a science so rare among 
the citizens of Mecca : it was not in the cool, deliberate act of a treaty that 
Mohammed would have dropped the mask ; nor can any conclusion be drawn 
from the words of disease and delirium. The lettered youth, before he aspired 
to the prophetic character, must have often exercised^ in private^ life, the 
arts of reading and writing; and his first converts, of his own family, would 
have been the first to detect and upbraid his scandalous hypocrisy (White's 
Sermons, p. 203, 204, Notes, p. xxxvL-xxxviii.). 

[Modern Orientalists are now inclined to answer the question, "Could 
Mohammed read and write?" in the affirmative. The point hinges upon thrt 
critical interpretation of certain important passages in the Koran, Moslem 
authors are at variance. Almost all the modern writers, and many of the 
old, deny the ability of their prophet to read and write: but good authors, 
especially of the Shiite sect, admit that he could read, though they describe 
him as an unskilful penman. 0. S.]

been indulged in the political and philosophical observations which are 
ascribed to the Arabian traveller? 1 He compares the nations and the 
religions of the earth; discovers the weakness of the Persian and Roman 
monarchies; beholds with pity and indignation the degeneracy of the 
times; and resolves to unite under one God and one king the invincible 
spirit and primitive virtues of the Arabs. Our more accurate inquiry 
will suggest, that, instead of visiting the courts, the camps, the temples 
of the East, the two journeys of Mohammed into Syria were confined to 
the fairs of Bostra and Damascus; that he was only thirteen years of 
age when he accompanied the caravan of his uncle; and that his duty 
compelled him to return as soon as he had disposed of the merchandise 
of Cadijah. In these hasty and superficial excursions the eye of genius 
might discern some objects invisible to his grosser companions; some 
seeds of knowledge might be cast upon a fruitful soil; but his ignorance 
of the Syriac language must have checked his curiosity; and I cannot 
perceive in the life or writings of Mohammed that his prospect was far 
extended beyond the limits of the Arabian world. From every region 
of that solitary world the pilgrims of Mecca were annually assembled 
by the calls of devotion and commerce: in the free concourse of multi- 
tudes, a simple citizen, in his native tongue, might study the political 
state and character of the tribes, the theory and practice of the Jews 
and Christians. Some useful strangers might be tempted, or forced, to 
implore the rights of hospitality; and the enemies of Mohammed have 
named the Jew, the Persian, and the Syrian monk, whom they accuse of 
lending their secret aid to the composition of the Koran. 78 Conversa- 
tion enriches the understanding, but solitude is the school of genius; 
and the uniformity of a work denotes the hand of a single artist. From 
his earliest youth Mohammed was addicted to religious contemplation; 
each year, during the month of Ramadan, he withdrew from the world 
and from the arms of Cadijah: in the cave of Hera, three miles from 
Mecca, 70 he consulted the spirit of fraud or enthusiasm, whose abode is 
not in the heavens, but in the mind of the prophet. The faith which, 
under the name of Islam, he preached to his family and nation, is com-

journey to the court of Persia is probably a fiction, nor can I trace the origin 
of his exclamation, " Les Grecs sont pourtant des hommes." The two Syrian 
journeys are expressed by almost all the Arabian writers, both Mohammedans 
and Christians (Gagnier, ad. Abulfed. p. 10).

pounded of an eternal truth and a necessary fiction. THAT THERE is 

ONLY ONE GOD, AND MOHAMMED IS THE APOSTLE OF GOD. 80 

It is the boast of the Jewish apologists, that, while the learned nations 
of antiquity were deluded by the fables of polytheism, their simple 
ancestors of Palestine preserved the knowledge and worship of the true 
God. The moral attributes of Jehovah may not easily be reconciled 
with the standard of human virtue: his metaphysical qualities are 
darkly expressed; but each page of the Pentateuch and the Prophets 
is an evidence of his power: the unity of his name is inscribed on the 
first table of the law; and his sanctuary was never defiled by any visible 
image of the invisible essence. After the ruin of the temple, the faith 
of the Hebrew exiles was purified, fixed, and enlightened by the spiritual 
devotion of the synagogue; and the authority of Mohammed will not 
justify his perpetual reproach that the Jews of Mecca or Medina adored 
Ezra as the son of God. 81 But the children of Israel had ceased to 
be a people; and the religions of the world were guilty, at least in the 
eyes of the prophet, of giving sons, or daughters, or companions to the 
supreme God. In the rude idolatry of the Arabs the crime is manifest 
and audacious: the Sabians are poorly excused by the pre-eminence of 
the first planet, or intelligence, in their celestial hierarchy; and in the 
Magian system the conflict of the two principles betrays the imperfec- 
tion of the conqueror, The Christians of the seventh century had insen- 
sibly relapsed into a semblance of paganism; their public and private 
vows were addressed to the relics and images that disgraced the temples 
of the East: the throne of the Almighty was darkened by a cloud of 
martyrs, and saints, and angels, the objects of popular veneration; and 
the Collyridian heretics, who flourished in the fruitful soil of Arabia, 
invested the Virgin Mary with the name and honours of a goddess. 82 
The mysteries of the Trinity and Incarnation appear to contradict the 
principle of the divine unity. In their obvious sense, they introduce 
three equal deities, and transform the man Jesus into the substance of 
the Son of God: 88 an orthodox commentary will satisfy only a believing

mind: intemperate curiosity and zeal had torn the veil of the sanctuary: 
and each of the Oriental sects was eager to confess that all, except 
themselves, deserved the reproach of idolatry and polytheism. The 
creed of Mohammed is free from suspicion or ambiguity; and the Koran 
is a glorious testimony to the unity of God. The prophet of Mecca 
rejected the worship of idols and men, of stars and planets, on the 
rational principle that whatever rises must set, that whatever is born 
must die, that whatever is corruptible must decay and perish. 84 In the 
Author of the universe his rational enthusiasm confessed and adored an 
infinite and eternal being, without form or place, without issue or 
similitude, present to our most secret thoughts, existing by the necessity 
of his own nature, and deriving from himself all moral and intellectual 
perfection. These sublime truths, thus announced in the language of 
the prophet, 88 are firmly held by his disciples, and defined with meta- 
physical precision by the interpreters of the Koran. A philosophic 
theist might subscribe the popular creed of the Mohammedans: 88 a 
creed too sublime perhaps for our present faculties. What object 
remains for the fancy, or even the understanding, when we have ab- 
stracted from the unknown substance all ideas of time and space, of 
motion and matter, of sensation and reflection? The first principle 
of reason and revelation was confirmed by the voice of Mohammed: 
fais proselytes, from India to Morocco, are distinguished by the 
name of Unitarians; and the danger of idolatry has been prevented 
by the interdiction of images. The doctrine of eternal decrees and 
absolute predestination is strictly embraced by the Mohammedans; 
and they struggle with the common difficulties, how to reconcile the 
prescience of God with the freedom and responsibility of man; how to 
explain the permission of evil under the reign of infinite power and 
infinite goodness. 87 

maintained, as it is said, by some barbarians at the Council of Nice (Eutych, 
Annal. torn, I p. 440). But the existence of the Marianitcs is denied by the 
candid Beausobre (Hist, de Manich&amp;sme, torn. i. p. 532) ; and he derives 
the mistake from the word Rouah, the Holy Ghost, which in some Oriental 
tongues is of the feminine gender, and is figuratively styled the mother of 
Christ in the gospel of the Nazarenes. 

"This train of thought is philosophically exemplified in the character of 
Abraham, who opposed in Chaldsea the first introduction of idolatry (Koran, 
c. 6, p. 106; D'Herbelot, Biblioth. Orient, p. 13).

the fifty-eighth (p. 441) chapters, which proclaim the omnipotence of the 
Creator.

p. 4-28). The great truth, that God is without similitude, is foolishly criti- 
cised by Maracci (Alcoran, torn. i. part iii. p. 87-94), because he made man 
after his own image.

THE ROMAN EMPIRE 83 

The God of nature has written his existence on all his worka, and his 
law in the heart of man. To restore the knowledge of the one, and the 
practice of the other, has been the real or pretended aim of the prophets 
of every age: the liberality of Mohammed allowed to his predecessors 
the same credit which he claimed for himself; and the chain of inspira- 
tion was prolonged from the fall of Adam to the promulgation of the 
Koran. 88 During that period some rays of prophetic light had been 
imparted to one hundred and twenty-four thousand of the elect, dis- 
criminated by their respective measure of virtue and grace; three 
hundred and thirteen apostles were sent with a special commission to 
recall their country from idolatry and vice; one hundred and four 
volumes have been dictated by the Holy Spirit; and six legislators of 
transcendent brightness have announced to mankind the six successive 
revelations of various rites, but of one immutable religion. The author- 
ity and station of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Christ, and Moham- 
med, rise in just gradation above each other; but whosoever hates or 
rejects any one of the prophets is numbered with the infidels. The 
writings of the patriarchs were extant only in the apocryphal copies 
of the Greeks and Syrians^ 88 the conduct of Adam had not entitled 
him to the gratitude or respect of his children; the seven precepts of 
Noah were observed by an inferior and imperfect dass of the proselytes 
of the synagogue; 90 and the memory of Abraham was obscurely revered 
by the Sabians in his native land of Chaldaea: of the myriads of 
prophets, Moses and Christ alone lived and reigned; and the remnant 
of the inspired writings was comprised in the books of the Old and 
New Testament. The miraculous story of Moses is consecrated and 
embellished in the Koran;* 1 and the captive Jews enjoy the secret 
revenge of imposing their own belief on the nations whose recent creeds 
they deride. For the author of Christianity, the Mohammedans are 
taught by the prophet to entertain a high and mysterious reverence. 92 
" Verily, Christ Jesus, the son of Mary, is the apostle of God, and his 

charged Mohammed with taking his whole doctrine from a book called the 
"Asatyr of the Ancients," which is several times quoted in the Koran, and 
appears to have contained the doctrine of the resurrection. Qoss had 
preached the unity of God, and other preachers, before Mohammed.-~O. S.}

honourable in this world, and in the world to come; and one of those

genuine and apocryphal gospels 04 are profusely heaped on his head; 
and the Latin church has not disdained to borrow from the Koran the 
immaculate conception 9S of his virgin mother. Yet Jesus was a mere 
mortal; and, at the day of judgment, his testimony will serve to con- 
demn both the Jews, who reject him as a prophet, and the Christians, 
who adore him as the Son of God. The malice of his enemies aspersed 
his reputation, and conspired against his life; but their intention only 
was guilty; a phantom or a criminal was substituted on the cross; 
and the innocent saint was translated to the seventh heaven. 00 During 
six hundred years the Gospel was the way of truth and salvation; but 
the Christians insensibly forgot both the laws and the example of their 
founder; and Mohammed was instructed by the Gnostics to accuse the 
church, as well as the synagogue, of corrupting the integrity of the 
sacred text. 07 The piety of Moses and of Christ rejoiced in the assur- 
ance of a future Prophet, more illustrious than themselves: the evangelic 
promise of the Paraclete, or Holy Ghost, was prefigured in the name, 
and accomplished in the person, of Mohammed, 08 the greatest and the 
last of the apostles of God.

who thinks our present copy more recent than Mohammed. Yet his quota- 
tions agree with the original about the speech of Christ in his cradle, his 
living birds of clay, etc. (Sike, c. i. p. 168, 169, c. 36, p. 198, 199, c. 46,

Bernard as a presumptuous novelty (Fra Paolo, Istoria del Concilio di

est praestantissimus dolose agentium (an odd praise) ... nee crucifixerunt 
cum, sed objecta est eis similitude: an expression that may suit with the 
system of the Docetes; but the commentators believe (Maracci, torn ii 
p. 113-115, 173; Sale, p. 42, 43, 79) that another man, a friend or an enemy! 
was crucified in the likeness of Jesus; a fable which they had read in the 
gospel of St Barnabas, and which had been started as early as the time of 
Iroueus, by some Ebionite heretics (Beausobre, Hist du Manicheisme, torn, ii 
p. 25; Mosheim de Reb. Christ, p. 353). 

"This charge is obscurely urged in the Koran (c. 3, p. 45); but neither 
Mohammed nor his followers are sufficiently versed in languages and criti- 
cism to give any weight or colour to their suspicions. Yet the Arians and 
Nestonans ; could relate some stories, and the illiterate prophet might listen 
to the bold assertions of the Manichaeans. See Beausobre, torn. i. p. 2Qi-30&lt;&gt;

' THE ROMAN EMPIRE 85 

The communication of ideas requires a similitude of thought and 
language: the discourse of a philosopher would vibrate without effect 
on the ear of a peasant; yet how minute is the distance of their 
understandings, if it be compared with the contact of an infinite and 
a finite mind, with the word of God expressed by the tongue or 
the pen of a mortal? The inspiration of the Hebrew prophets, of the 
apostles and evangelists of Christ, might not be incompatible with the 
exercise of their reason and memory; and the diversity of their genius 
is strongly marked in the style and composition of the books of the 
Old and New Testament. But Mohammed was content with a character 
more humble, yet more sublime, of a simple editor; the substance of 
the Koran, 90 according to himself or his disciples, is uncreated and 
eternal; subsisting in the essence of the Deity, and inscribed with a 
pen of light on the table of his everlasting decrees. A paper copy, in a 
volume of silk and gems, was brought down to the lowest heaven by 
the angel Gabriel, who, under the Jewish economy, had indeed been 
despatched on the most important errands; and this trusty messenger 
successively revealed the chapters and verses to the Arabian prophet. 
Instead of a perpetual and perfect measure of the divine will, the frag- 
ments of the Koran were produced at the discretion of Mohammed; 
each revelation is suited to the emergencies of his policy or passion; 
and all contradiction is removed by the saving maxim that any text of 
Scripture is abrogated or modified by any subsequent passage. The 
word of God and of the apostle was diligently recorded by his disciples 
on palm-leaves and the shoulder-bones of mutton; and the pages, with- 
out order or connection, were cast into a domestic chest in the custody 
of one of his wives. Two years after the death of Mohammed, the sacred 
volume was collected and published by his friend and successor Abu- 
beker: the work was revised by the caliph Othman, in the thirtieth 
year of the Hegira; and the various editions of the Koran assert the 
same miraculous privilege of a uniform and incorruptible text. 100 In

** [Abubeker, at the suggestion of Omar, gave orders for the collection and 
publication of the Koran ; but the editorial work was actually performed by 
Zeid Ibn Thabit, who had been one of Mohammed's secretaries. He is re- 
lated to have gathered the text "from date-leaves and tablets of white 
stone, and from the breasts of men." The recension of Othman has been 
handed down to the present day unaltered. So carefully has it been preserved 
that there are no variations of importance among the innumerable copies 
scattered throughout the world. Contending and embittered factions, orig- 
inating in the murder of Othman himself, within a quarter of a century 
after the death of Mohammed, have ever since rent the Moslem world. Yet 
but one Koran has been current among them, and the consentaneous use of it 
by all proves that we have now before us the self-same text prepared by the 
commands of that unfortunate caliph who was a Moslem martyr. O. SJ

the spirit of enthusiasm or vanity, the prophet rests the truth of his 
mission on the merit of his book; audaciously challenges both men 
and angels to imitate the beauties of a single page; and presumes to 
assert that God alone could dictate this incomparable performance. 101 
This argument is most powerfully addressed to a devout Arabian, whose 
mind is attuned to faith and rapture; whose ear is delighted by the 
music of sounds; and whose ignorance is incapable of comparing the 
productions of human genius. 103 The harmony and copiousness of style 
will not reach, in a version, the European infidel: he will peruse with 
impatience the endless incoherent rhapsody cf fable, and precept, and 
declamation, which seldom excites a sentiment or an idea, which some- 
times crawls in the dust, and is sometimes lost in the clouds. The 
divine attributes exalt the fancy of the Arabian missionary; but his 
loftiest strains must yield to the sublime simplicity of the book of Job, 
composed in a remote age, in the same country, and in the same 
language. 103 If the composition of the Koran exceeds the faculties of a 
man, to what superior intelligence should we ascribe the Iliad of Homer, 
or the Philippics of Demosthenes? In all religions the life of the founder 
supplies the silence of his written revelation: the sayings of Mohammed 
were so many lessons of truth; his actions so many examples of virtue; 
and the public and private memorials were preserved by his wives and 
companions. At the end of two hundred years the Sonna, or oral law, 
was fixed and consecrated by the labours of Al Bochari, who discrim- 
inated seven thousand two hundred and seventy-five genuine traditions 
from a mass of three hundred thousand reports of a more doubtful or 
jpurious character. Each day the pious author prayed in the temple of 
Mecca, and performed his ablutions with the water of Zemzem: the 
pages were successively deposited on the pulpit and the sepulchre of the 
apostle; and the work has been approved by the four orthodox sects 
of the Sonnites. 104 

The mission of the ancient prophets, of Moses and of Jesus, had been 
confirmed by many splendid prodigies; and Mohammed was repeatedly 
\irged, by the inhabitants of Mecca and Medina, to produce a similar 
evidence of his divine legation; to call down from heaven the angel

passed by a human pen (Pocock, Specimen, p. 221, etc.) ; and Maracci (the

or the volume of his revelation, to create a garden in the desert, or to 
kindle a conflagration in the unbelieving city. As often as he is pressed 
by the demands of vie Koreish, he involves himself in the obscure boast 
of vision and prophecy, appeals to the internal proofs of his doctrine, 
and shields himself behind the providence of God, who refuses those 
signs and wonders that would depreciate the merit of faith and aggra- 
vate the guilt of infidelity: But the modest or angry tone of his apologies 
betrays his weakness and vexation; and these passages of scandal estab- 
lished beyond suspicion the integrity of the Koran. 105 The votaries of 
Mohammed are more assured than himself of his miraculous gifts; and 
their confidence and credulity increase as they are farther removed 
from the time and place of his spiritual exploits. They believe or affirm 
that trees went forth to meet him; that he was saluted by stones; that 
water gushed from his fingers; that he fed the hungry, cured the sick, 
and raised the dead; that a beam groaned to him; that a camel com- 
plained to him; that a shoulder of mutton informed him of its being 
poisoned; and that both animate and inanimate nature were equally 
subject to the apostle of God. 106 His dream of a nocturnal journey is 
seriously described as a real and corporeal transaction. A mysterious 
animal, the Borak, conveyed him from the temple of Mecca to that 
of Jerusalem: with his companion Gabriel he successively ascended the 
seven heavens, and received and repaid the salutations of the patriarchs, 
the prophets, and the angels, in their respective mansions. Beyond the 
seventh heaven Mohammed alone was permitted to proceed; he passed 
the veil of unity, approached within two bow-shots of the throne, and 
felt a cold that pierced him to the heart, when his shoulder was touched 
by the hand of God. After this familiar though important conversation, 
he again descended to Jerusalem, remounted the Borak, returned to 
Mecca, and performed in the tenth part of a night the journey of 
many thousand years. 107 According to another legend, the apostle con- 

U8 See, more remarkably, Koran, c. 2, 6, 12, 13, 17. Prideaux (Life of 
Mahomet, p. 18, 19) has confounded the impostor. Maracci, with a more 
learned apparatus, has shown that the passages which deny his miracles are 
clear and positive (Alcoran, torn. i. part ii. p. 7-12), and those which seem 
to assert them are ambiguous and insufficient (p. 12-22) . 

""See the Specimen Hist. Arabum, the text of Abulpharagius, p. 17; the 
notes of Pocock, p. 187-190; D'Herbelot, Bibliotheque Orientate, p. 76, 77;

has most laboriously collected and confuted the miracles and prophecies of 
Mohammed, which, according to some writers, amount to three thousand. 

107 The nocturnal journey is circumstantially related by Abulf eda (in Vit 
Mohammed, c. 19, p. 33), who wishes to think it a vision; by Prideaux 
(p. 31-40), who aggravates the absurdities; and by Gagnier (torn. L p. 252- 
343), who declares, from the zealous Al Jannabi, that to deny this journey 
is to disbelieve the Koran. Yet the Koran, without naming either heaven, 
or Jerusalem, or Mecca, has only dropped a mysterious hint: Laus ilK qui 
transtulit servum suum ab oratorio Haram ad oratorium remotissimum

founded in a national assembly the malicious challenge of the Koreish. 
His resistless word split asunder the orb of the moon: the obedient 
planet stooped from her station in the sky, accomplished the seven 
revolutions round the Caaba, saluted Mohammed in the Arabian tongue, 
and, suddenly contracting her dimensions, entered at the collar, and 
issued forth through the sleeve, of his shirt. 108 The vulgar are amused 
with these marvellous tales; but the gravest of the Musulman doctors 
imitate the modesty of their master, and indulge a latitude of faith or 
interpretation. 100 They might speciously allege, that in preaching the 
religion it was needless to violate the harmony of nature; that a creed 
unclouded with mystery may be excused from miracles; and that the 
sword of Mohammed was not less potent than the rod of Moses. 

The polytheist is oppressed and distracted by the variety of super- 
stition: a thousand rites of Egyptian origin were interwoven with the 
essence of the Mosaic law; and the spirit of the Gospel had evaporated 
in the pageantry of the church. The prophet of Mecca was tempted 
by prejudice, or policy, or patriotism, to sanctify the rites of the 
Arabians, and the custom of visiting the holy stone of the Caaba. But 
the precepts of Mohammed himself inculcate a more simple and rational 
piety: prayer, fasting, and alms are the religious duties of a Musulman; 
and he is encouraged to hope that prayer will carry him half way to 
God, fasting will bring him to the door of his palace, and alms will gain 
him admittance. 110 I. According to the tradition of the nocturnal 
journey, the apostle, in his personal conference with the Deity, was 
commanded to impose on his disciples the daily obligation of fifty 
prayers. By the advice of Moses, he applied for an alleviation of this 
intolerable burden; the number was gradually reduced to five; without 

108 In the prophetic style, which uses the present or past for the future, 
Mohammed had said, Approprinquavit hora et scissa est luna (Koran, c. 54, 
V. i; in Maracci, torn. ii. p. 688). This figure of rhetoric has been converted 
into a fact, which is said to be attested by the most respectable eye-witnesses 
f Maracci, torn. ii. p. 690). The festival is still celebrated by the Persians 
(Chardin, torn. iv. p. 201) ; and the legend is tediously spun out by Gagnier 
(Vie de Mahomet, torn. i. p. 183-234), on the faith, as it should seem, of 
the credulous Al Jannabi. Yet a Mohammedan doctor has arraigned the 
credit of the principal witness (apud Pocock, Specimen, p. 187) ; the best 
interpreters are content with the simple sense of the Koran (Al Beidawi, 
apud Hottinger, Hist. Orient. 1. ii. p. 302), and the silence of Abulfeda is 
worthy of a prince and a philosopher.

any dispensation of business or pleasure, or time or place: the devotion 
of the faithful is repeated at daybreak, at noon, in the afternoon, in the 
evening, and at the first watch of the night; and in the present decay 
of religious fervour, our travellers are edified by the profound humility 
and attention of the Turks and Persians. Cleanliness is the key of 
prayer: the frequent lustration of the hands, the face, and the body, 
which was practised of old by the, Arabs, is solemnly enjoined by the 
Koran; and a permission is formally granted to supply with sand the 
scarcity of water. The words and attitudes of supplication, as it is per- 
formed either sitting, or standing, or prostrate on the ground, are 
prescribed fay custom or authority; but the prayer is poured forth in 
short and fervent ejaculations; the measure of zeal is not exhausted by 
a tedious liturgy; and each Musulman for his own person is invested 
with the character of a priest. Among the theists, who reject the use 
of images, it has been found necessary to restrain the wanderings of the 
fancy, by directing the eye and the thought towards a kebla or visible 
point of the horizon. The prophet was at first inclined to gratify the 
Jews by the choice of Jerusalem; but he soon returned to a more natural 
partiality; and five times every day the eyes of the nations at Astracan t 
at Fez, at Delhi, are devoutly turned to the holy temple of Mecca. 113 
Yet every spot for the service of God is equally pure: the Mohamme- 
dans indifferently pray in their chamber or in the street. As a distinction 
from the Jews and Christians, the Friday in each week is set apart for 
the useful institution of public worship: the people is assembled in 
the mosch; and the imam, some respectable elder, ascends the pulpit, 
to begin the prayer and pronounce the sermon. But the Mohammedan 
religion is destitute of priesthood or sacrifice; and the independent 
spirit of fanatacism looks down with contempt on the ministers and 
the slaves of superstition. II. The voluntary 112 penance of the ascetics, 
the torment and glory of their lives, was odious to a prophet who 
censured in his companions a rash vow of abstaining from flesh, and 
women, and sleep; and firmly declared that he would suffer no monks 
in his religion. 118 Yet he instituted, in each year, a fast of thirty days; 

111 [Mohammed at first granted the Jews many privileges in observing their 
ancient customs and their Sabbath, and he himself kept the fast of ten days 
with which the Jewish year begins. But when he found himself deceived in 
his expectations of converting them their privileges were withdrawn. Mecca 
was substituted for Jerusalem as the Kebla, or quarter to which the face 
is. directed during prayer, and in place of the Jewish fast that of Ramadhan

taking their priests and monks for tiieir lords, besides God. Yet Maracci

and quotes, from the Koran itself, the case of Eblis, or Satan, who was cast 
from heaven for refusing to adore Adam.

and strenuously recommended the observance as a discipline which 
purifies the soul and subdues the body, as a salutary exercise of obedi- 
ence to the will of God and his apostle. During the month of Ramadan, 
from the rising to the setting of the sun, the Musulman abstains from 
eating, and drinking, and women, and baths, and perfumes; from all 
'nourishment that can restore his strength, from all pleasure that can 
gratify his senses. In the revolution of the lunar year, the Ramadan 
coincides, by turns, with the winter cold and the summer heat; and the 
patient martyr, without assuaging his thirst with, a drop of water, must 
expect the close of a tedious and sultry day. The interdiction of wine, 
peculiar to some orders of priests or hermits, is converted by Mohammed 
alone into a positive and general law; 114 and a considerable portion of 
the globe has abjured, at his command, the use of that salutary, though 
dangerous, liquor. These painful restraints are, doubtless, infringed 
by the libertine, and eluded by the hypocrite; but the legislator, by 
whom they are enacted, cannot surely be accused of alluring his prose- 
lytes by the indulgence of their sensual appetites. III. The charity of 
the Mohammedans descends to the animal creation; and the Koran 
repeatedly inculcates, not as a merit, but as a strict and indispensable 
duty, the relief of the indigent and unfortunate. Mohammed, perhaps, 
is the only lawgiver who has defined the precise measure of charity: 
the standard may vary with the degree and nature of property, as it 
consists either in money, in corn or cattle, in fruits or merchandise: 
but the Musulman does not accomplish the law, unless he bestows a 
tenth of his revenue; and if his conscience accuses him of fraud or ex- 
tortion, the tenth, under the idea of restitution, is enlarged to a fifth. 
Benevolence is the foundation of justice, since we are forbid to injure 
those whom we are bound to assist. A prophet may reveal the secrets 
of heaven and of futurity; but in his moral precepts he can only repeat 
the lessons of our own hearts. 

The two articles of belief, and the four .practical duties, of Islam, 11 * 
are guarded by rewards and punishments; and the faith of the Musul- 
man is devoutly fixed on the event of the judgment and the last day. 
The prophet has not presumed to determine the moment of that awful 

n * See the double prohibition (Koran, c. .2, p. 25, c. 5, p. 94} ; the- one in 
the style of a legislator, the other in that of a fanatic. The public and 
private motives of Mohammed are investigated by Prideaux (Life of Ma- 
homet, p. 62, 64) and Sale (Preliminary Discourse, p. 124). 

** The jealousy of Maracci (Prodromus, part iv. p. 33} prompts him to 
enumerate the more liberal alms of the Catholics of Rome. Fifteen great 
hospitals are open to *nany thousand patients and pilgrims; fifteen hundred 
maidens are annually portioned; fifty-six charity-schools are founded for 
both sexes ; one hundred and twenty confraternities, relieve the wants of their 
brethren, etc. The benevolence of London is still more extensive; but I 
am afraid that much more is to be ascribed to the humanity than to the 
religion of the people,

catastrophe, though he darkly announces the signs, both in heaven and 
earth, which will precede the universal dissolution, when life shall be 
destroyed, and the order of creation shall be confounded in the primitive 
chaos. At the blast of the trumpet new worlds will start into being; 
angels, genii, and men will arise from the dead, and the human soul 
will again be united to the body. The doctrine of the resurrection was 
first entertained by the Egyptians; 117 and their mummies were em- 
balmed, their pyramids were constructed, to preserve the ancient mansion 
of the soul during a period of three thousand years. But the attempt 
is partial and unavailing; and it is with a more philosophic spirit that 
Mohammed relies on the omnipotence of the Creator, whose word can 
re-animate the breathless day, and collect the innumerable atoms that 
no longer retain their form or substance. 118 The intermediate state of 
the soul it is hard to decide; and those who most firmly believe her 
immaterial nature, are at a loss to understand how she can think or 
act without the agency of the organs of sense. 

The re-union of the sod and body will be followed by the final 
judgment of mankind; and in his copy of the Magian picture, the 
prophet has too faithfully represented the forms of proceeding, and 
even the slow and successive operations, of an earthly tribunal. By 
his intolerant adversaries he is upbraided for extending, even to them- 
selves, the hope of salvation; for asserting the blackest heresy, that 
every man who believes in God, and accomplishes good works, may 
expect in the last day a favourable sentence. Such rational indifference 
is ill adapted to the character of a fanatic; nor is it probable that a 
messenger from heaven should depreciate the value and necessity of his 
own revelation. In the idiom of the Koran, 119 the belief of God is 
inseparable from that of Mohammed: the good works are those which 
he has enjoined; and the two qualifications imply tie profession of 
Islam, to which all nations and all sects are equally invited. The spirit- 
ual blindness, though excused by ignorance and crowned with virtue, 
will be scourged with everlasting torments; and the tears which Mo-* 
hammed shed over the tomb of his mother, for whom he was forbidden 
to pray, display a striking contrast of humanity and enthusiasm. 120 

nT See Herodotus (L ii. c. 123) and our learned countryman Sir John Mar- 
sham (Canon. Chronicus, p. 46). The "Afys of the same writer (p. 254-274)

fancy of the Egyptians and Greeks, of the poets and philosophers of an-

92 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

The doom of the infidels is common: the measure of their guilt and 
punishment, is determined by the degree of evidence which they have 
rejected, by the magnitude of the errors which they have entertained: 
the eternal mansions of the Christians, the Jews, the Sabians, the 
Magians, and the idolaters are sunk below each other in the abyss; 
and the lowest hell is reserved for the faithless hypocrites who have 
assumed the mask of religion. After the greater part of mankind has 
been condemned for their opinions, the true believers only will be 
judged by their actions. The good and evil of each Musulman will be 
accurately weighed in a real or allegorical balance; and a singular mode 
of compensation will be allowed for the payment of injuries: the aggres- 
sor will refund an equivalent of his own good actions, for the benefit of 
the person whom he has wronged; and if he should be destitute of any 
moral property, the weight of his sins will be loaded with an adequate 
share of the demerits of the sufferer. According as the shares of guilt 
or virtue shall preponderate, the sentence will be pronounced, and all, 
without distinction, will pass over the sharp and perilous bridge of the 
abyss; but the innocent, treading in the footsteps of Mohammed, will 
gloriously enter the gates of paradise, while the guilty will fall into 
the first and mildest of the seven hells. The term of expiation will vary 
from nine hundred to seven thousand years; but the prophet has judi- 
ciously promised that all his disciples, whatever may be their sins, shall 
be saved, by their own faith and his intercession, from eternal damna- 
tion. It is not surprising that superstition should act most powerfully 
on the fears of her votaries, since the human fancy can paint with more 
energy the misery than the bliss of a future life. With the two simple 
elements of darkness and fire we create a sensation of pain, which 
may be aggravated to an infinite degree by the idea of endless duration. 
But the same idea operates with an opposite effect on the continuity 
of pleasure; and too much of our present enjoyments is obtained from 
the relief, or the comparison, of evil. It is natural enough that an 
Arabian prophet should dwell with rapture on the groves, the fountains, 
and the rivers of paradise; but instead of inspiring the blessed inhabi- 
tants with a liberal taste for harmony and science, conversation and 
friendship, he idly celebrates the pearls and diamonds, the robes of 
silk, palaces of marble, dishes of gold, rich wines, artificial dainties, 
numerous attendants, and the whole train of sensual and costly luxury, 
which becomes insipid to the owner, even in the short period of this 
mortal life. Seventy-two Houris, or black-eyed girls, of resplendent 
beauty, blooming youth, virgin purity, and exquisite sensibility, will be 
created for the use of the meanest believer; a moment of pleasure will 
be prolonged to a thousand years, and his faculties will be increased a 
hundred fold, to render him worthy of his felicity. Notwithstanding a 
vulgar prejudice,- the gates of heaven will be open to both sexes; but 

enemy of God. Yet Abraham (he adds, c. 9, v. 116; Maracci, torn. ii. p. 317) 
fuit sane pius, mitis. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 93 

Mohammed has not specified the male companions of the female elect, 
lest he should either alarm the jealousy of their former husbands, or 
disturb their felicity by the suspicion of an everlasting marriage. This 
image of a carnal paradise has provoked the indignation, perhaps the 
envy, of the monks: they declaim against the impure religion of Mo- 
hammed; and his modest apologists are driven to the poor excuse of 
figures and allegories. But the sounder and more consistent party 
adhere, without shame, to the literal interpretation of the Koran: useless 
would be the resurrection of the body, unless it were restored to the 
possession and exercise of its worthiest faculties; and the union of 
sensual and intellectual enjoyment is requisite to complete the happiness 
of the double animal, the perfect man. Yet the joys of the Mohamme- 
dan paradise will not be confined to the indulgence of luxury and appe- 
tite; and the prophet has expressly declared that all meaner happiness 
will be forgotten and despised by the saints and martyrs, who shall be 
admitted to the beatitude of the divine vision. 121 

The first and most arduous conquests of Mohammed 122 were those 
of his wife, his servant, his pupil, and his friend; 123 since he presented

v. 25, c. 56, 78, etc.), with Maracci's virulent but learned refutation (in his 
notes, and in the Prodromus, part iv. p. 78, 120, 122, etc.) ; D'Herbelot (Bib- 
liotheque Orientale, p. 368, 375) ; Reland (p. 47-6i) ; and Sale (p. 76-103).. 
The original ideas of the Magi are darkly and doubtfully explored by their 
apologist Dr. Hyde (Hist. Religionis Persarum, c. 33, P- 402-412, Oxon. 1760). 
In the article of Mohammed, Bayle has ^shown how indifferently wit and- 
philosophy supply the absence of genuine information. 

^Before I enter on the history of the prophet, it is incumbent on me to 
produce my evidence. The Latin, French, and English versions of the 
Koran are preceded by historical discourses, and the three translators, Maracci 
(torn. i. p. 10-32), Savary (torn. i. p. 1-248), and Sale (Preliminary Discourse, 
P- 33-56), had accurately studied the language and character of their author. 
Two professed Lives of Mahomet have been composed by Dr. Prideaux 
(Life of Mahomet, seventh edition, London, 1718, in octavo) and the Count 
de Boulainvilliers (Vie de Mahomet, Londres, 1730, in octavo); but the 
adverse wish of finding an impostor or a hero has too often corrupted the 
learning of the Doctor and file ingenuity of the Count. The article in 
D'Herbelot (Biblioth. Orient p. 598-603) is chiefly drawn from Novairi and 
Mirkond; but the best and most authentic of our guides is M. Gagnier, a 
Frenchman by birth, and professor at Oxford of the Oriental tongues. In 
two elaborate works (Ismael Abulfeda de Vita et Rebus gestis Mohammedis, 
etc., Latine vertit, Pnefatione et Notis illustravit Johannes Gagnier, Oxon. 
1723, in folio; La Vie de Mahomet traduite et compilee de 1'Alcoran, des 
Traditions Authentiques de la Sonna et des meilleurs Auteurs Arabes, Am- 
sterdam. 1748, 3 vols. in I2mo) he has interpreted, illustrated, and supplied 
the Arabic text of Abulfeda and Al Jannabi; the first an enlightened prince, 
who reigned at Hamah, in Syria, A.D. 1310-1332 (see* Gamier, Prafat ad 
Abulfed.) ; the second a .credulous doctor, who visited Mecca A.D. 1550. 
(D'Herbelot, p. 397 J Gagnier, torn. iii. p. 209, 210.) These are my general 
vouchers, and the inquisitive reader may follow the order of time and the 
division of chapters. Yet I must observe that both Abulfeda^and Al Jannabi 
are modern historians, and that they cannot appeal to any writers of the first 
century of the Hegira. , . . . r

himself as a prophet to those who were most conversant with his 
infirmities as a man. Yet Cadijah believed the words, and cherished 
the glory, of her husband; the obsequious and affectionate Zeid was 
tempted by the prospect of freedom; the illustrious Ali, the son of Abu 
Taleb, 124 embraced the sentiments of his cousin with the spirit of a 
youthful hero; and the wealth, the moderation, the veracity of Abube- 
ker, confirmed the religion of the prophet whom he was destined to 
succeed. By his persuasion ten of the most respectable citizens of Mecca 
were introduced to the private lessons of Islam; they yielded to the 
voice of reason and enthusiasm; they repeated the fundamental creed, 
"There is but one God, and Mohammed is the apostle of God;" and 
their faith, even in this life, was rewarded with riches and honours, 
with the command of armies and the government of kingdoms. Three 
years were silently employed in the conversion of fourteen proselytes, 
the first-fruits of his mission; but in the fourth year he assumed the 
prophetic office, and, resolving to impart to his family the light of divine 
truth, he prepared a banquet, a lamb, as it is said, and a bowl of milk, 
for the entertainment of forty guests of the race of Hashem. " Friends 
and kinsmen," said Mohammed to the assembly, " I offer you, and I 
alone can offer, the most precious of gifts, the treasures of this world 
and of the world to come. God has commanded me to call you to his 
service. Who among you will support my burden? Who among you will 
be my companion and my vizir?" 125 No answer was returned, till 
the silence of astonishment, and doubt, and contempt was at length 
broken by the impatient courage of Ali, a youth in the fourteenth year 
of his age. " prophet, I am the man: whosoever rises against thee, 
I will dash out his teeth, tear out his eyes, break his legs, rip up his 
belly. prophet, I will be thy vizir over them." Mohammed accepted 
his offer with transport, and Abu Taleb was ironically exhorted to re- 
spect the superior dignity of his son. In a more serious tone, the father 
of Ali advised his nephew to relinquish his impracticable design. " Spare 
your remonstrances," replied the intrepid fanatic to his uncle and bene- 
factor; " if they should place the sun on my right hand, and the moon 
on my left, they should not divert me from my course." He persevered 

of Mohammed. As if he had been a privy counsellor of the prophet, Boulain- 
villiers (p. 272, etc.) unfolds the sublime and patriotic views of Cadijah and 
the first disciples.

ten years in the exercise of his mission; and the religion which has 
overspread the East and the West advanced with a slow and painful 
progress within the walls of Mecca. Yet Mohammed enjoyed the satis- 
faction of beholding the increase of his infant congregation of Uni- 
tarians, who revered him as a prophet, and to whom he seasonably 
dispensed the spiritual nourishment of the Koran. The number of prose- 
lytes may be esteemed by the absence of eighty-three men and eighteen 
women, who retired to /Ethiopia in the seventh year of his mission; 
and his party was fortified by tie timely conversion of his uncle Hamza, 
and of the fierce and inflexible Omar, who signalised in the cause of 
Islam the same zeal which he had exerted for its destruction. Nor was 
the charity of Mohammed confined to the tribe of Koreish, or the pre- 
cincts of Mecca: on solemn festivals, in the days of pilgrimage, he 
frequented the Caaba, accosted the strangers of every tribe, and urged, 
both in private converse and public discourse, the belief and worship of 
a sole Deity. Conscious of his reason and of his weakness, he asserted 
the liberty of conscience, and disclaimed the use of religious violence: 12 * 
but he called the Arabs to repentance, and conjured them to remember 
the ancient idolaters of Ad and Thamud, whom the divine justice had 
swept away from the face of the earth. 127 

The people of Mecca were hardened in their unbelief by superstition 
and envy. The elders of the city, the uncles of the prophet, affected to 
despise the presumption of an orphan, the reformer of his country: 
the pious orations of Mohammed in the Caaba were answered by the 
clamours of Abu TaJeb. " Citizens and pilgrims, listen not to the tempter, 
hearken not to his impious novelties. Stand fast in the worship of 
Al Lata and Al Uzzah." Yet the son of Abdallah was ever dear to the 
aged chief: and he protected the fame and person of his nephew against 
.the assaults of the Koreishites, who had long been jealous of the pre- 
eminence of the family of Hashem. Their malice was coloured with the 
pretence of religion: in the age of Job the crime of impiety was punished 
by the Arabian magistrate; 128 and Mohammed was guilty of deserting 
and denying the national deities. But so loose was the policy of Mecca, 

128 The passages of the Koran in behalf of toleration are strong and numer- 
ous : c. 2, v. 257, c. 16, 129, c. 17, 54 c. 45, IS, c. 50, 39, c. 88, 21, etc., with the 
notes of Maracci and Sale. This character alone may generally decide the 
doubts of the learned, whether a chapter was revealed at Mecca or Medina. 

*" See the Koran (passim, and especially c. 7, p. 123, 124, etc.), and the tra- 
dition of the Arabs (Pocock, Specimen, p. 35-37). The caverns of the tribe of 
Thamud, fit for men of the ordinary stature, were shown in the midway be- 
tween Medina and Damascus (Abulfed. Arabia Descript p. 43, 44), and may 
be probably ascribed to the Troglodytes of the primitive world (Michaelis, ad 
Lowth de Poesi Hebraeor. p. 131-134; Recherches sur les Egyptiens. torn. ii. 
p. 48, etc.). 

184 In the time of Job the crime of impiety was punished by the Arabian 
magistrate (c. 31, v. 26, 27, 28). I blush for a respectable prelate (de Poesi 
Hebraeorum, p. 650, 651, edit. Michaelis ; and a letter of a late professor in the 
university of Oxford, p. 15-53), who justifies and applauds this patriarchal 
inquisition. 



9 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

that the leaders of the Koreish, instead of accusing a criminal, were 
compelled to employ the measures of persuasion or violence. They re- 
peatedly addressed Abu Taleb in the style of reproach and menace. 
" Thy nephew reviles our religion; he accuses our wise forefathers of 
ignorance and folly; silence him quickly, lest he kindle tumult and 
discord in the city. If he persevere, we shall draw our swords against 
him and his adherents, and thou wilt be responsible for the blood of thy 
fellow-citizens." The weight and moderation of Abu Taleb eluded the 
violence of religious faction; the most helpless or timid of the disciples 
retired to Ethiopia, and the prophet withdrew himself to various places 
of strength in the town and country. As he was still supported by his 
family, the rest of he tribe of Koreish engaged themselves to renounce 
all intercourse with the children of Hashem neither to buy nor sell, 
neither to marry nor to give in marriage, but to pursue them with im- 
placable enmity, till they should deliver the person of Mohammed to 
the justice of the gods. The decree was suspended in the Caaba before 
the eyes of the nation: the messengers of the Koreish pursued the Musul- 
man exiles in the heart of Africa; they besieged the prophet and his most 
faithful followers, intercepted their water, and inflamed their mutual 
animosity by the retaliation of injuries and insults. A doubtful truce 
restored the appearances of concord, till the death of Abu Taleb aban- 
doned Mohammed to the power of his enemies, at the moment when 
he was deprived of his domestic comforts by the loss of his faithful 
and generous Cadijah. Abu Sophian, the chief of the branch of Ommi- 
yah, succeeded to the principality of the republic of Mecca. A zealous 
votary of the idols, a mortal foe of the line of Hashem, he convened an 
assembly of the Koreishites and their allies to decide the fate of the 
apostle. His imprisonment might provoke the despair of his" enthusiasm; 
and the exile of an eloquent and popular fanatic would diffuse the mis- 
chief through the provinces of Arabia. "His death was resolved; and they 
agreed that a sword from each tribe should be buried in his heart, to 
divide the guilt of his blood, and baffle the vengeance of the Hashemites. 
An angel or a spy revealed their conspiracy, and flight was the only 
resource of Mohammed. 129 At the dead of night, accompanied by his 
friend Abubeker, he silently escaped from his house: the assassins 
watched at the door; but they were deceived by the figure of Ali, who 
reposed on the bed, and was covered with the green vestment, of the 
apostle. The Koreish respected the piety of the heroic youth; but 
some verses of Ali, which are still extant, exhibit an interesting picture 
of his anxiety, his tenderness, and his religious confidence. Three days 
Mohammed and his companion were concealed in the cave of Thor, 
at the distance of a league from Mecca; and in the close of each evening 
they received from the son and daughter of Abubeker a secret supply of 
intelligence and food. The diligence of the Koreish explored every

haunt in the neighbourhood of the city: they arrived at the entrance 
of the cavern; but the providential deceit of a spider's web and a pigeon's 
nest is supposed to convince them that the place was solitary and invio- 
late. " We are only two," said the trembling Abubeker. ' There is a 
third," replied the prophet; " it is God himself." No sooner was the 
pursuit abated than the two fugitives issued from the rock and mounted 
their camels: on the road to Medina they were overtaken by the emis- 
saries of the Koreish; they redeemed themselves with prayers and prom- 
ises from their hands. In this eventful moment the lance of an Arab 
might have changed the history of the world. The flight of the prophet 
from Mecca to Medina has fixed the memorable era of the Hegira^ 
which, at the end of twelve centuries, still discriminates the lunar years 
of the Mohammedan nations. 181 

The religion of the Koran might have perished in its cradle had not 
Medina embraced with faith and reverence the holy outcasts of Mecca. 
Medina, or the city, known under the name of Yathreb before it was 
sanctified by the throne of the prophet, was divided between the tribes 
of the Charegites and the Awsites, whose hereditary feud was rekindled 
by the slightest provocations: two colonies of Jews, who boasted a sacer- 
dotal race, were their humble allies, and, without converting the Arabs, 
they introduced the taste of science and religion, which distinguished 
Medina as the city of the Book. Some of her noblest citizens, in a 
pilgrimage to the Caaba, were converted by the preaching of Mo- 
hammed; on their return they diffused the belief of God and his prophet, 
and the new alliance was ratified by their deputies in two secret and 
nocturnal interviews on a hill in the suburbs of Mecca. In the first, 
ten Charegites and two Awsites, united in faith and love, protested, in 
the name of their wives, their children and their absent brethren, that 
they would for ever profess the creed and observe the precepts of the 
Koran. The second was a political association, the first vital spark of 
the empire of the Saracens. 182 Seventy-three men and two women of 
Medina held a solemn conference with Mohammed, his kinsmen, and 
his disciples, and pledged themselves to each other by a mutual oath 
of fidelity. They promised, in the name of the city, that if he should 
be banished they would receive him as a confederate, obey him as a 
leader, and defend him to the last extremity, like their wives and chil- 
dren. " But if you are recalled by your country," they asked with a

flattering anxiety, " will you not abandon your new allies? " " All 
things," replied Mohammed, with a smile, " are now common between 
us; your blood is as my blood, your ruin as my ruin. We are bound 
to each other by the ties of honour and interest. I am your friend, 
and the enemy of your foes." " But if we are killed in your service,

embraced the profession of Islam; they rejoiced in the exile of the 
apostle, but they trembled for his safety, and impatiently expected his 
arrival. After a perilous and rapid journey along the sea-coast, he 
halted at Koba, two miles from the city, and made his public entry 
into Medina, sixteen days after his flight from Mecca. Five hundred 
of the citizens advanced to meet him; he was hailed with acclamations 
of loyalty and devotion; Mohammed was mounted on a she-camel, an 
umbrella shaded his head, and a turban was unfurled before him to 
supply the deficiency of a standard. His bravest disciples, who had 
been scattered by the storm, assembled round his person; and the 
equal, though various, merit of the Moslems was distinguished by the 
names of Mohagerians and Ansars, the fugitives of Mecca, and the 
auxiliaries of Medina. To eradicate the seeds of jealousy, Mohammed 
judiciously coupled his principal followers with the rights and obliga- 
tions of brethren; and when Ali found himself without a peer, the 
prophet tenderly declared that he would be the companion and brother 
of the noble youth. The expedient was crowned with success; the holy 
fraternity was respected in peace and war, and the two parties vied 
with each other in a generous emulation of courage and fidelity. Once 
only the concord was slightly ruffled by an accidental quarrel: a patriot 
of Medina arraigned the insolence of the strangers, but the hint of 
their expulsion was heard with abhorrence; and his own son most 
eagerly offered to lay at the apostle's feet the head of his father. 

From his establishment at Medina, Mohammed assumed the exercise 
of the regal and sacerdotal office; and it was impious to appeal from a 
judge whose decrees were inspired by the divine wisdom. A small por- 
tion of ground, the patrimony of two orphans, was acquired by gift or 
purchase; 188 on that chosen spot he built a house and a mosch, more 
venerable in their rude simplicity than the palaces and temples of the 

"Trideaux (Life of Mahomet, p. 44) reviles the wickedness of the im- 
postor, who despoiled two poor orphans, the sons of a carpenter ; a reproach 
which he drew from the Disputatio contra Saracenos, composed in Arabic 
before the year 1130; but the honest Gagnier (ad Abulfed, p. 53) has shown 
that they were deceived by the word Al Nag jar, which signifies, in this place, 
not an obscure trade, but a noble tribe of Arabs. The desolate state of the 
ground is described by Abulfeda; and his worthy interpreter has proved, 
from Al Bochari, the offer of a price; from Al Jannabi, the fair purchase; 
and from Ahmed Ben Joseph, the payment of the money by the generous 
Abubeker. On these grounds the prophet must be honourably acquitted,

Assyrian caliphs. His seal of gold, or silver, was inscribed with the 
apostolic title; when he prayed and preached in the weekly assembly, 
he leaned against the trunk of a palm tree; and it was long before he 
indulged himself in the use of a chair or pulpit of rough timber. 134 
After a reign of six years fifteen hundred Moslems, in arms and in the 
field, renewed their oath of allegiance; and their chief repeated the 
assurance of protection till the death of the last member, or the final 
dissolution of the party. It was in the same camp that the deputy ol 
Mecca was astonished by the attention of the faithful to the words and 
looks of the prophet, by the eagerness with which they collected his 
spittle, a hair that dropped on the ground, the refuse water of his lus- 
trations, as if they participated in some degree of the prophetic virtue. 
" I have seen," said he, " the Chosroes of Persia and the Caesar of Rome, 
but never did I behold a king among his subjects like Mohammed 
among his companions." The devout fervour of enthusiasm acts with 
more energy and truth than the cold and formal servility of courts. 

In the state of nature every man has a right to defend, by force of 
arms, his person and his possessions; to repel, or even to prevent, the 
violence of his enemies, and to extend his hostilities to a reasonable 
measure of satisfaction and retaliation. In the free society of the Arabs, 
the duties of subject and citizen imposed a feeble restraint; and Moham- 
med, in the exercise of a peaceful and benevolent mission, had been 
despoiled and banished by the injustice of his countrymen. The choice 
of an independent people had exalted the fugitive of Mecca to the rank 
of a sovereign; and he was invested with the just, prerogative of form- 
ing alliances, and of waging offensive or defensive war. The imperfec- 
tion of human rights was supplied and armed by the plenitude of 
divine power: the prophet of Medina assumed, in his new revelations, 
a fiercer and more sanguinary tone, which proves that his former mod- 
eration was the effect of weakness: 135 the means of persuasion had been 
tried, the season of forbearance was elapsed, and he was now com- 
manded to propagate his religion by the sword, to destroy the monu- 
ments of idolatry, and, without regarding the sanctity of days or 
months, to pursue the unbelieving nations of the earth. The same 
bloody .precepts, so repeatedly inculcated in the Koran, are ascribed by 
the author to the Pentateuch and the Gospel. But the mild tenor of 
the evangelic style may explain an ambiguous text, that Jesus did not 
bring peace on the earth, but a sword: his patient and humble virtues 
should not be confounded with the intolerant zeal of princes and bish- 
ops, who have disgraced the name of his disciples. In the prosecution 
of religious war, Mohammed might appeal with more propriety to the 
example of Moses, of the Judges, and the kings of Israel. The military

pulpit as two venerable relics of the apostle of God; and the portrait of his 
court is taken from Abulfeda (c. 44, p. 85). 

185 The eighth and ninth chapters of the Koran are the loudest and most 
vehement; and .Maracci (Prodromus, part iv. p. 59-64) has inveighed with

laws of the Hebrews are still more rigid than those of the Arabian 
legislator. 188 The Lord of hosts marched in person before the Jews: 
if a city resisted their summons, the males, without distinction, were 
put to the sword: the seven nations of Canaan were devoted to destruc- 
tion; and neither repentance nor conversion could shield them from the 
inevitable doom, that no creature within their precincts should be left 
alive. The fair option of friendship, or submission, or battle, was pro- 
posed to the enemies of Mohammed. If they professed the creed of 
Islam, they were admitted to all the temporal and spiritual benefits of 
his primitive disciples, and marched under the same banner to extend 
the religion which they had embraced. The clemency of the prophet 
was decided by his interest: yet he seldom trampled on a prostrate 
enemy; and he seems to promise that on the payment of a tribute the 
least guilty of his unbelieving subjects might be indulged in their wor- 
ship, or at least in their imperfect faith. In the first months of his 
reign he practised the lessons of holy warfare, and displayed his white 
banner before the gates of Medina: the martial apostle fought in person 
at nine battles or sieges; 137 and fifty enterprises of war were achieved in 
ten years by himself or his lieutenants. The Arab continued to unite 
the professions of a merchant and a robber; and his petty excursions for 
die defence or the attack 'of a caravan insensibly prepared his troops 
for the conquest of Arabia. The distribution of the spoil was regulated 
by a divine law: 188 the whole was faithfully collected in one common 
mass: a fifth of the gold and silver, the prisoners and cattle, the mov- 
ables and immovables, was reserved by the prophet for pious and 
charitable uses; the remainder was shared in adequate portions by the 
soldiers who had obtained the victory or guarded the camp: the rewards 
of the slain devolved to their widows and orphans; and the increase of 
cavalry was encouraged by the allotment of a double share to the horse 
and to the man. From all sides the roving Arabs were allured to the 
standard of religion and plunder: the apostle sanctified the licence of 
embracing the female captives as their wives or concubines; and the 
enjoyment of wealth and beauty was a feeble type of the joys of para- 
dise prepared for the valiant martyrs of the faith. " The sword," says 
Mohammed, " is the key of heaven and of hell: a drop of blood shed 

188 The tenth and twentieth chapters of Deuteronomy, with the practical 
comments of Joshua, David, etc., are read with more awe than satisfaction 
by the pious Christians of the present age. But the bishops, as well as the 
rabbis of former times, have beat the drum-ecclesiastic with pleasure and 
success. (Sale's Preliminary Discourse, p. 142, 143.) 

m Abulfeda, in Vit. Moham. p. 156. The private arsenal of the apostle 
consisted of nine swords, three lances, seven pikes or half-pikes, a quiver and 
three bows, seven cuirasses, three shields, and two helmets (Gagnier, torn. iii. 
P- 328-334), with a large white standard, a black banner (p. 335), twenty 
horses (p. 322), etc. Two of his martial sayings are recorded by tradition 
(Gagnier, torn. ii. p. 88, 337).

in the cause of God, a night spent in arms, is of more avail than two 
months of fasting and prayer: whosoever falls in battle, his sins are 
forgiven: at the day of judgment his wounds shall be resplendent as 
vermilion, and odoriferous as musk; and the loss of his limbs shall be 
supplied by the wings of angels and cherubim." The intrepid souls of 
the Arabs were fired with enthusiasm: the picture of the invisible world 
was strongly painted on their imagination; and the death which they 
had always despised became an object of hope and desire. The Koran 
inculcates, in the most absolute sense, the tenets of fate and predestina- 
tion, which would extinguish both industry and virtue, if the actions of 
man were governed by his speculative belief. Yet their influence in 
every age has exalted the courage of the Saracens and Turks. The first 
companions of Mohammed advanced to battle with a fearless con- 
fidence: there is no danger where there is no chance: they were ordained 
to perish in their beds; or they were safe and invulnerable amidst the 
darts of the enemy. 189 

Perhaps the Koreish would have been content with the flight of 
Mohammed, had they not been provoked and alarmed by the ven- 
geance of an enemy who could intercept their Syrian trade as it passed 
and repassed through the territory of Medina. Abu Sophian himself, 
with only thirty or forty followers, conducted a wealthy caravan of a 
thousand camels; the fortune or dexterity of his march escaped the 
vigilance of Mohammed; but the chief of the Koreish was informed that 
the holy robbers were placed in ambush to await his return. He 
despatched a messenger to his brethren of Mecca, and they were roused, 
by the fear of losing their merchandise and their provisions, unless they 
hastened to his relief with the military force of the city. The sacred 
band of Mohammed was formed of three hundred and thirteen 
Moslems, of whom seventy-seven were fugitives, and the rest auxiliaries: 
they mounted by turns a train of seventy camels (the camels of Yathreb 
were formidable in war) ; but such was the poverty of his first disciples, 
that only two could appear on horseback in the field. 140 In the fertile 
and famous vale of Beder, 141 three stations from Medina, he was in- 

189 The doctrine of absolute predestination, on which few religions can 
reproach each other, is sternly exposed in the Koran (c. 3, p. 52, 53, c. 4, p. 70, 
etc., with the notes of Sale, and c. 17, p. 413, with those of Maracci) . Reland 
(de Relig. Moham. p. 61-64) and Sale (Prelim. Discourse, p. 103) represent 
the opinions of the doctors, and our modern travellers the confidence, the 
fading confidence, of the Turks. 

"A1 Jannabi (apud Gagmer, torn. ii. p. 9) allows him seventy or eighty 
horse; and on two other occasions, prior to the battle of Ohud, he enlists 
a body of thirty (p. 10) and of 500 (p. 66) troopers. Yet the Musulmans, in 
the field of Ohud, had no more than two horses, according to the better sense 
of Abulfeda (in Vit Mohamm. c. 31, p. 65). In the Stony province the camels 
were numerous ; but the horse appears to have been less common than in the 
Happy or the Desert Arabia.

formed by his scouts of the caravan that approached on one side; of 
the Koreish, one hundred horse, eight hundred and fifty foot, who 
advanced on the other. After a short debate he sacrificed the prospect 
of wealth to the pursuit of glory and revenge; and a slight intrenchment 
was formed to cover his troops, and a stream of fresh water that glided 
through the valley. "0 God," he exclaimed as the numbers of the 
Koreish descended from the hills, " O God, if these are destroyed, by 
whom wilt thou be worshipped on the earth? Courage, my children; 
close your ranks; discharge your arrows, and the day is your own." 
At these words he placed himself, with Abubeker, on a throne or 
pulpit, 142 and instantly demanded the succour of Gabriel and three 
thousand angels. His eye was fixed on the field of battle: the Musul- 
mans fainted and were pressed: in that decisive moment the prophet 
started from his throne, mounted his horse, and cast a handful of sand 
into the air; " Let their faces be covered with confusion." Both armies 
heard the thunder of his voice: their fancy beheld the angelic war- 
riors: 1 * 8 the Koreish trembled and fled: seventy of the bravest were 
slain; and seventy captives adorned the first victory of the faithful. 144

both of the interpreter and of a the hero, I am sorry to observe the pride 
and acrimony with which Reiske chastises his fellow-labourer. Ssepe sic

[Mohammed was by no means the courageous individual Gibbon makes 
him out to be. Weil, in his Life of Mohammed, says, " His behaviour in his 
different campaigns, as well as in the first years of his appearance as a 
prophet, and also towards u the close of his life, when he was become very 
powerful, compels us, despite his endurance and perseverance, to characterise 
him as very timorous. It was not until after the conversion of Omar and 
Hamza that he ventured openly to appear in the mosque along with the 
professors of his faith as a Moslem. He not only took no part in the fight 
at the battle of Bedr, but kept at some distance from the field, and had 
some dromedaries ready before his tent in order to flee in case of a reverse." 
O. S.] 

ltt The loose expressions of the Koran (c. 3, p. 124, 125, c. 8, p. 9) allow 
the commentators to fluctuate between the numbers of 1000, 3000, or 9000 
angels; and t the smallest of these might suffice for the slaughter of seventy 
of the Koreish (Maracci, Alcoran, torn. ii. p. 131). Yet the same scholiasts 
confess that this angelic band was not visible to any mortal eye (Maracci, 
p. 297). They refine on the words (c, 8, 16), "not thou, but God," etc. 
(D'Herbelot, Biblioth. Orientale, p. 600, 601). 

"* [Among the captives was Abbas, the rich uncle of Mohammed, who was 
obliged to pay ransom, though he alleged that inwardly he was a believer and 
had been forced to take part in the expedition against the prophet. He re- 
turned to Mecca, where he served Mohammed as a spy, On the occasion of 
the second battle, at Mount Ohud, six miles north of Medina, Abd Allah, with 
200 men, deserted Mohammed at a critical moment, so that the disproportion 
of the forces was vastly greater than at Bedr. O. S.] 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 103 

The dead bodies of the Koreish were despoiled and insulted: two of 
the most obnoxious prisoners were punished with death; and the ran- 
som of the others, four thousand drachms of silver, compensated in 
some degree the escape of the caravan. But it was in vain that the 
camels of Abu Sophian explored a new road through the desert and 
along the Euphrates: they were overtaken by the diligence of the 
Musulmans; and wealthy must have been the prize, if twenty thousand 
drachms could be set apart for the fifth of the apostle. The resentment 
of the public and private loss stimulated Abu Sophian to collect a body 
of three thousand men, seven hundred of whom were armed with 
cuirasses, and two hundred were mounted on horseback; three thousand 
camels attended his march; and his wife Henda, with fifteen matrons of 
Mecca, incessantly sounded their timbrels to animate the troops, and to 
magnify the greatness of Hobal, the most popular deity of the Caaba. 
The standard of God and Mohammed was upheld by nine hundred and 
fifty believers: the disproportion of numbers was not more alarming 
than in the field of Beder, and their presumption of victory prevailed 
against the divine and human sense of the apostle. The second battle 
was fought on Mount Ohud, six miles to the north of Medina: 1 * 5 the 
Koreish advanced in the form of a crescent; and the right wing of 
cavalry was led by Caled, the fiercest and most successful of the Arabian 
warriors. The troops of Mohammed were skilfully posted on the 
declivity of the hill; and their rear was guarded by a detachment ol 
fifty archers. The weight of their charge impelled and broke the 
centre of the idolaters: but in the pursuit they lost the advantage of 
their ground: the archers deserted their station: the Musulmans were 
tempted by the spoil, disobeyed their general, and disordered their 
ranks. The intrepid Caled, wheeling his cavalry on their flank and 
rear, exclaimed, with a loud voice, that Mohammed was slain. He 
was indeed wounded in the face with, a javelin: two of his teeth were 
shattered with a stone; yet, in the midst of tumult and dismay, he 
reproached the infidels with the murder of a prophet; arid blessed the 
friendly hand that stanched his blood, and conveyed him to a place of 
safety. 146 Seventy martyrs died for the sins of the people; they fell, 
said the apostle, in pairs, each brother embracing his lifeless com- 
panion; 147 their bodies were mangled by the inhuman females of 
Mecca; and the wife of Abu Sophian tasted the entrails of Hamza, the 
uncle of Mohammed. They might applaud their superstition and

and a double coat of mail. He was recognised among the wounded by Caab f

was carried to a cave upon an eminence. Thither he was pursued by Ubejj

for the purpose of surprising and killing Mohammed. But the latter killed 
him by one blow. O. S.]

satiate tkeir fury; but the Musulmans soon rallied in the field, and 
the Koreish wanted strength or courage to undertake the siege of 
Medina. It was attacked the ensuing year by an army of ten thousand 
enemies; and this third expedition is variously named, from the nations 
which marched under the banner of Abu Sophian, from the ditch which 
was drawn before the city, and a camp of three thousand Musulmans. 
The prudence of Mohammed declined a general engagement: the 
valour of Ali was signalised in single combat; and the war was pro- 
tracted twenty days, till the final separation of the confederates. A 
tempest of wind, rain, and hail overturned their tents: their private 
quarrels were fomented by an insidious adversary; and the Koreish, 
deserted by their allies, no longer hoped to subvert the throne, or to 
check the conquests, of their invincible exile. 148 

The choice of Jerusalem for the first kebla of prayer discovers the 
early propensity of Mohammed in favour of the Jews; and happy 
would it have been for their temporal interest had they recognized 
in the Arabian prophet the hope of Israel and the promised Messiah. 
Their obstinacy converted his friendship into implacable hatred, with 
which he pursued that unfortunate people to the last moment of his life; 
and in the double character of an apostle and a conqueror, his persecu- 
tion was extended to both worlds. 140 The Kainoka dwelt at Medina 
under the protection of the city: he seized the occasion of an accidental 
tumult, and summoned them to embrace his religion or contend with 
him in battle. " Alas," replied the trembling Jews, " we are ignorant 
of the use of arms, but we persevere in the faith and worship of our 
fathers; why wilt thou reduce us to the necessity of a just defence? " 
The unequal conflict was terminated in fifteen days; and it was with 
extreme reluctance that Mohammed yielded to the importunity of his 
allies, and consented to spare the lives of the captives. But their 
riches were confiscated, their arms became more effectual in the hands 
of the Musulmans; and a wretched colony of seven hundred exiles was 
driven with their wives and children to implore a refuge on the confines 
of Syria. The Nadhirites were more guilty, since they conspired in a 
friendly interview to assassinate the prophet. He besieged their 
castle, three miles from Medina; but their resolute defence ob- 
tained an honourable capitulation; and the garrison, sounding their 
trumpets and beating their drums, was permitted to depart with the 
honours of war. The Jews had excited and joined the war of the 
Koreish: no sooner had the nations retired from the ditch, than Mo- 
hammed, without laying aside his armour, marched on the same day

to extirpate the hostile race of the children of Kpraidha. After a 
resistance of twenty-five days they surrendered at discretion. They 
trusted to the intercession of their old allies of Medina: they could not 
be ignorant that fanaticism obliterates the feelings of humanity. A 
venerable elder, to whose judgment they appealed, pronounced the sen- 
tence of their death: seven hundred Jews were dragged in chains to the 
market-place of the city; they descended alive into the grave prepared 
for their execution and burial; and the apostle beheld with an in- 
flexible eye the slaughter of his helpless enemies. Their sheep and 
camels were inherited by the Musulmans: three hundred cuirasses, five 
hundred pikes, a thousand lances, composed the most useful portion 
of the spoil. Six days' journey to tie north-east of Medina, the ancient 
and wealthy town of Chaibar was the seat of the Jewish power in 
Arabia: the territory, a fertile spot in the desert, was covered with 
plantations and cattle, and protected by eight castles, some of which 
were esteemed of impregnable strength. The forces of Mohammed con- 
sisted of two hundred horse and fourteen hundred foot: in the succession 
of eight regular and painful sieges they were exposed to danger, and 
fatigue, and hunger; and the most undaunted chiefs despaired of the 
event. The apostle revived their faith and courage by the example of 
Ali, on whom he bestowed the surname of the Lion of God: perhaps 
we may believe that a Hebrew champion of gigantic stature was cloven 
to the chest by his irresistible scimitar; but we cannot praise the modesty 
of romance, which represents him as tearing from its hinges the gate of 
a fortress and wielding the ponderous buckler in his left hand. 150 After 
the reduction of the castles the town of Chaibar submitted to the yoke, 
The chief of the tribe was tortured, in the presence of Mohammed, to 
force a confession of his hidden treasure: the industry of the shepherds 
and husbandmen was rewarded with a precarious toleration: they were 
permitted, so long as it should please the conqueror, to improve their 
patrimony, in equal shares, for his emolument and their own. Under 
the reign of Omar, the Jews of Chaibar were transplanted to Syria; 
and the caliph alleged the injunction of his dying master, that one and 
the true religion should be professed in his native land of Arabia. 151 

Five times each day the eyes of Mohammed were turned towards 
Mecca, 152 and he was urged by the most sacred and powerful motives 

150 Abu Rafe, the servant of Mohammed, is said to affirm that he himself 
and seven other men afterwards tried, without success, to move the same 
gate from the ground (Abulfeda, p. 90). Abu Rafe was an eye-witness, but 
who will be witness for Abu Rafe? 

181 The banishment of the Jews is attested by Elmacin (Hist. Saracen, p. 9) 
and the great Al Zabari (Gagnier, torn. ii. p. 285). Yet Niebuhr (Description 
de 1'Arabie, p. 324) believes that the Jewish religion and Karaite sect are 
still professed by the tribe of Chaibar; and that, in the plunder of the 
caravans, the disciples of Moses are the confederates of those of Mohammed. 

182 The successive steps of the reduction of Mecca are related by Abulfeda

10 e THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

to revisit, as a conqueror, the city and the temple from whence he 
had been driven as an exile. The Caaba was present to his^ waking 
and sleeping fancy: an idle dream was translated into vision and 
prophecy; he unfurled the holy banner; and a rash promise of success 
too hastily dropped from the lips of the apostle. His march from 
Medina to Mecca displayed the peaceful and solemn pomp of a pil- 
grimage: seventy camels, chosen and bedecked for sacrifice, preceded 
the van; the sacred territory was respected; and the captives were dis- 
missed without ransom to proclaim his clemency and devotion. But no 
sooner did Mohammed descend into the plain, within a day's journey 
of the city, than he exclaimed, " They have clothed themselves with 
the skins of tigers:" the numbers and resolution of the Koreish opposed 
his progress; and the roving Arabs of the desert might desert or betray 
a leader whom they had followed for the hopes of spoil. The intrepid 
fanatic sunk into a cool and cautious politician: he waived in the treaty 
his title of apostle of God; concluded with the Koreish and their allies 
a truce of ten years; engaged to restore the fugitives of Mecca who 
should embrace his religion; and stipulated only, for the ensuing year, 
the humble privilege 01 entering the city as a friend, and of remaining 
three days to accomplish the rites of the pilgrimage. A cloud^of shame 
and sorrow hung on the retreat of the Musulmans, and their disappoint- 
ment might justly accuse the failure of a prophet who had so often 
appealed to the evidence of success. The faith and hope of the pilgrims 
were rekindled by the prospect of Mecca: their swords were sheathed: 
seven times in the footsteps of the apostle they encompassed the Caaba: 
the Koreish had retired to the hills, and Mohammed, after the customary 
sacrifice, evacuated the city on the fourth day. The people was edified 
by his devotion; the hostile chiefs were awed, or divided, or seduced; 
and both Caled and Amrou, the future conquerors of Syria and Egypt, 
most seasonably deserted the sinking cause of idolatry. The power of 
Mohammed was increased by the submission of the Arabian tribes; ten 
thousand soldiers were assembled for the conquest of Mecca; and the 
idolaters, the weaker party, were easily convicted of violating the truce. 
Enthusiasm and discipline impelled the march, and preserved the secret, 
tiH the blaze of ten thousand fires proclaimed to the astonished Koreish 
the design, the approach, and the irresistible force of the enemy. The 
haughty Abu Sophian presented the keys of the city; admired the 
variety of arms and ensigns that passed before him in review; observed 
that the son of Abdallah had acquired a mighty kingdom; and con- 
fessed, under the scimitar of Omar, that he was the apostle of the true 
God. The return of Marius and Sylla was stained with the blood of 
the Romans:, the revenge of Mohammed was stimulated by religious 
zeal, and his injured followers were eager to execute or to prevent the 
order of a massacre. Instead of indulging their passions and his own, 108

the victorious exile forgave the guilt, and united the factions, of Mecca. 
His troops, in three divisions, marched into the city: eight-and-twenty : 
of the inhabitants were slain by the sword of Caled; eleven men and 
six women were proscribed by the sentence of Mohammed; 154 but he 
blamed the cruelty of his lieutenant; and several of the most obnoxious 
victims were indebted for their lives to his clemency or contempt. The 
chiefs of the Koreish were prostrate at his feet. " What mercy can you 
expect from the man whom you have wronged? " " We confide in the 
generosity of our kinsman." '"And you shall not confide in vain: 
begone f you are safe, you are free." The people of Mecca deserved 
their pardon b&gt; the profession of Islam; and after an exile of seven 
years, the fugitive missionary was enthroned as the prince and prophet 
of his native country. 185 But the three hundred and sixty idols of the 
Caaba were ignominiously broken: the house of God was purified and 
adorned: as an example to future times, the apostle again fulfilled the 
duties of. a pilgrim; and a perpetual law was enacted that no unbeliever 
should dare to set his foot on the territory of the holy city. 156 

The conquest of Mecca determined the faith and obedience of the 
Arabian tribes;" 7 who, according to the vicissitudes of fortune, had 
obeyed, or disregarded, the eloquence or the arms of the prophet. In- 
difference for rites and opinions still marks the character of the Bedo 

ported by the truth of history, and can only allege, que celui qui fait la 
guerre a sa patrie au nom Dieu est capable de tout (CEuvres de Voltaire, 
torn. xv. p. 282). The maxim is neither charitable nor philosophic; and some 
reverence is surely due to the fame of heroes and the religion of nations. 
I am informed that a Turkish ambassador at Paris was much scandalised 
at the representation of this tragedy. 

** [Of these eleven men and six women who were proscribed, only four 
really met with the death sentence. The eight and twenty inhabitants of 
Mecca slain by dialed brought on the latter the censure of the prophet. 
The same thing happened on another occasion. The prophet had sent him 
on an expedition to the province of Tehama, and on passing through the 
territory of the Beni Djasima, Chaled caused a considerable number of them 
to be put to death, although they were already Mussulmans. Unfortunately, 
when required to confess their faith, they had, from ancient custom, used the 
word Saba'na (converts or renegades) instead of the usual Moslem expres- 
sion Aslamna. On hearing of the act, Mohammed raised his hands to 
heaven and exclaimed, " O God, I am pure before thee, and have taken no 
part in Chaled' s deed." Mohammed compensated the Beni Djasima for the 
slaughter of their kinsmen, but the services of Chaled obliged him to over- 
look his offence. O. S.]

by force or consent (Abulfeda, p. 107, et Gagnier ad locum) ; and this verbal 
controversy is of as much moment as our own about William the Conqueror,

than the Musulmans themselves. The Christians are received without scruple 
into the ports of Mocha, and even of Gedda; and it is only the city and pre- 
cincts of Mecca that are inaccessible to the profane (Niebuhr, Description de

weens; and they might accept, as loosely as they hold, the doctrine of 
the Koran. Yet an obstinate remnant still adhered to the religion and 
liberty of their ancestors, and the war of Honain derived a proper 
appellation from the idols, whom Mohammed had vowed to destroy, 
and whom the confederates of Tayef had sworn to defend. 168 Four 
thousand Pagans advanced with secrecy and speed to surprise the 
conqueror: they pitied and despised the supine negligence of the Koreish, 
but they depended on the wishes, and perhaps the aid, of a people who 
had so lately renounced their gods, and bowed beneath the yoke of 
their enemy. The banners of Medina and Mecca were displayed by the 
prophet; a crowd of Bedoweens increased the strength or numbers of 
the army, and twelve thousand Musulmans entertained a rash and sinful 
presumption of their invincible strength. They descended without pre- 
caution into the valley of Honain: the heights had been occupied by 
the archers and slingers of the confederates; their numbers were op* 
pressed, their discipline was confounded, their courage was appalled, 
and the Koreish smiled at their impending destruction. The prophet, 
on his white mule, was encompassed by the enemies: he attempted to 
rush against their spears in search of a glorious death: ten of his faithful 
companions interposed their weapons and their breasts; three of these 
fell dead at his feet: " my brethren," he repeatedly cried with sorrow 
and indignation, " I am the son of Abdallah, I am the apostle of truth! 
man, stand fast in the faith! God, send down thy succour! " His 
uncle Abbas, who, like the heroes of Homer, excelled in the loudness 
of his voice, made the valley resound with the recital of the gifts and 
promises of God: the flying Moslems returned from all sides to the 
holy standard; and Mohammed observed with pleasure that the furnace 
was again rekindled: his conduct and example restored the battle, and 
he animated his victorious troops to inflict a merciless revenge on the 
authors of their shame. From the field of Honain he marched without 
delay to the siege of Tayef, sixty miles to the south-east of Mecca, a 
fortress of strength, whose fertile lands produce the fruits of Syria in 
the midst of the Arabian desert. A friendly tribe, instructed (I know 
not how) in the art of sieges, supplied him with a train of battering- 
rains and military engines, with a body of five hundred artificers. But 
it was in vain that he offered freedom to the slaves of Tayef; that he 
violated his own laws by the extirpation of the fruit-trees; that the 
ground was opened by the miners; that the breach was assaulted by the 
troops. After a siege of twenty days the prophet sounded a retreat; 
but he retreated with a song of devout triumph, and affected to pray 
for the repentance and safety of the unbelieving city. The spoil of 
this fortunate expedition amounted to six thousand captives, twenty-

Tayef was supposed to be a piece of the land of Syria detached and dropped

four thousand camels, forty thousand sheep, and four thousand ounces 
of silver: a tribe who had fought at Honain redeemed their prisoners 
by the sacrifice of their idols: but Mohammed compensated the loss 
by resigning to the soldiers his fifth of the plunder, and wished, for 
their sake, that he possessed as many head of cattle as there were trees 
in the province of Tehama. Instead of chastising the disaffection of 
the Koreish, he endeavoured to cut out their tongues (his own expres- 
sion), and to secure their attachment, by a superior measure of liberal- 
ity: Abu Sophian alone was presented with three hundred camels and 
twenty ounces of silver; and Mecca was sincerely converted to the 
profitable religion of the Koran. 

The fugitives and auxiliaries complained that they who had borne the 
burden were neglected in the season of victory. "Alas! " replied their 
artful leader, " suffer me to conciliate these recent enemies, these doubt- 
ful proselytes, by the gift of some perishable goods. To your guard I in- 
trust my life and fortunes. You are the companions of my exile, of my 
kingdom, of my paradise." He was followed by the deputies of Tayef, 
who dreaded the repetition of a siege. " Grant us, apostle of Godl a 
truce of three years with the toleration of our ancient worship." " Not 
a month, not an hour." " Excuse us at least from the obligation of 
prayer." " Without prayer religion is of no avail." They submitted in 
silence: their temples were demolished, and the same sentence ol 
destruction was executed on all the idols of Arabia. His lieutenants, 
on the shores of the Red Sea, the Ocean, and the Gulf of Persia, were 
saluted by the acclamations of a faithful people; and the ambassadors 
who knelt before the throne of Medina were as numerous (says the 
Arabian proverb) as the dates that fall from the maturity of a palm- 
tree. The nation submitted to the God and the sceptre of Mohammed: 
the opprobrious name of tribute was abolished: the spontaneous or 
reluctant oblations of alms and tithes were applied to the service of 
religion; and one hundred and fourteen thousand Moslems accom- 
panied the last pilgrimage of the apostle. 169 

When Heraclius returned in triumph from the Persian war, he enter- 
tained, at Emesa, one of the ambassadors of Mohammed, who invited 
the princes and nations of the earth to the profession of Islam. On 
this foundation the zeal of the Arabians has supposed the secret con- 
version of the Christian emperor: the vanity of the Greeks has feigned 
a personal visit of the prince of Medina, who accepted from the royal 
bounty a rich domain, and a secure retreat, in the province of Syria. 160

feda (p. 121-133), Gagnier (torn. iii. p. 119-219), Elmacin (p. 10, n Uto

But the friendship of Heraclius and Mohammed was of short continu- 
ance: the new religion had inflamed rather than assuaged the rapacious 
spirit of the Saracens; and the murder of an envoy afforded a decent 
pretence for invading, with three thousand soldiers, the territory of 
Palestine, that extends to the eastward of the Jordan. The holy banner 
was intrusted to Zeid; and such was the discipline or enthusiasm of 
the rising sect, that the noblest chiefs served without reluctance under 
the slave of the prophet. On the event of his decease, Jaafar and 
Abdallah were successively substituted to the command; and if the 
three should perish in the war, the troops were authorised to elect 
their general. The three leaders were slain in the battle of Muta, 101 
the first military action which tried the valour of the Moslems against 
a foreign enemy. Zeid fell, like a soldier, in the foremost ranks: the 
death of Jaafar was heroic and memorable: he lost his right hand: he 
shifted the standard to his left: the left was severed from his body: 
he embraced the standard with his bleeding stumps, till he was trans- 
fixed to the ground with fifty honourable wounds. " Advance," cried 
Abdallah, who stepped into the vacant place, " advance with confidence: 
either victory or paradise is our own." The lance of a Roman decided 
the alternative; but the falling standard was rescued by Caled, the 
proselyte of Mecca: nine swords were broken in his hand; and his 
valour withstood and repulsed the superior numbers of the Christians. 
In the nocturnal council of the .camp he was chosen to command: his 
skilful evolutions of the ensuing day secured either the victory or the 
retreat of the Saracens; and Caled is renowned among his brethren and 
his enemies by the glorious appellation of the Sword of God. In the 
pulpit, Mohammed described, with prophetic rapture, the crowns of 
the blessed martyrs; but in private he betrayed the feelings of human 
nature: he was surprised as he wept over the daughter of Zeid: " What 
do I see? " said the astonished votary. " You see," replied the apostle, 
" a friend who is deploring the loss of his most faithful friend." After 
the conquest of Mecca the sovereign of Arabia affected to prevent the 
hostile preparations of Heraclius; and solemnly proclaimed war against 
the Romans, without attempting to disguise the hardships and dangers 
of the enterprise. 102 The Moslems were discouraged: they alleged the

afe The expedition of Tabuc is recorded by our ordinary historians, Abul- 
feda (Vit Moham. p. 123-127) and Gagnier (Vie de Mahomet, torn. iii. p. 147- 
163) ; but we have the advantage of appealing to the original evidence of the 
Koran (c. 9, p. 154, 165), with Sale's learned and rational notes. 

[The expedition to Tabuc was undertaken in the month of Radjab of the 
ninth year of the Hegira (A.D. 631). Mohammed's friends gave a great part 
of their substance towards defraying its expenses Abu Bekr gave the whole 
of his property, consisting of 4000 drachms, and when Mohammed asked, 
"What then hast thou left for thy family?" the answer was "God, and 
his prophet." -The traditions vary exceedingly respecting the number of the

want of money, or horses, or provisions; the season of harvest, and the 
intolerable heat of the summer: " Hell is much hotter," said the in- 
dignant prophet. He disdained to compel their service: but on his return 
he admonished the most guilty, by an excommunication of fifty days. 
Their desertion enhanced the merit of Abubeker, Othman, and the 
faithful companions who devoted their lives and fortunes; and Mo- 
hammed displayed his banner at the head of ten thousand horse and 
twenty thousand foot. Painful indeed was the distress of the march: 
lassitude and thirst were aggravated by the scorching and pestilential 
winds of the desert: ten men rode by turns on the same camel; and 
they were reduced to the shameful necessity of drinking the water from 
the belly of that useful animal. In the mid-way, ten days' journey 
from Medina and Damascus, they reposed near the grove and fountain 
of Tabuc. Beyond that place Mohammed declined the prosecution of 
the war: he declared himself satisfied with the peaceful intentions, he 
was more probably daunted by the martial array, of the emperor of 
the East. But the active and intrepid Caled spread around the terror 
of his name; and the prophet received the submission of the tribes and 
cities, from the Euphrates to Ailah, at the head of the Red Sea. To his 
Christian subjects Mohammed readily granted the security of theii 
persons^ the freedom of their trade, the property of their goods, and 
the toleration of their worship. 168 The weakness of their Arabian breth- 
ren had restrained them from opposing his ambition; the disciples of 
Jesus were endeared to the enemy of the Jews; and it was the interest 
of a conqueror to propose a fair capitulation to the most powerful 
religion of the earth. 
Till the age of sixty-three years the strength of Mohammed was equal 

army assembled on this occasion. About 30,000 is the lowest estimate given; 
but this is probably exaggerated, and a large number deserted at the outset 
of the march. When Mohammed at Tabuc consulted his companions as to 
the further prosecution of the enterprise, Omar said, " If you are commanded 
by God to go further, do it" The prophet answered, " If I had the command 
of God I should not ask your advice." Omar replied, " prophet of God ! 
the Greeks are a numerous people, and there is not a single Mussulman among 
them. Moreover, we have already nearly approached them, and your neigh- 
bourhood has struck them with terror. This year, therefore, let us return, 
till you find it convenient to undertake another campaign against them; of 
till God offers some other opportunity." 0. S.] 

'"The Diploma securitatis Allenstbus is attested by Ahmed Ben Joseph, 
and the author Libri Splendorum (Gagnier, Not. ad Abulfedara, p. 125) ; but 
Abulfeda himself, as well as Elmacin (Hist. Saracen, p. n), though he owns 
Mohammed's regard for the Christians (p. 13), only mention peace and 
tribute. In the year 1630 Sionita published at Paris the text and version of 
Mohammed's patent in favour of the Christians; .which was admitted and 
reprobated by the opposite taste of Salmasius and Grotius (Bayle, MAHOMET, 
Rem. AA). Hottinger doubts of its authenticity (Hist. Orient p. 237); 
Renaudot urges the consent of the Mohammedans (Hist Patriarch. Alex, 
p. 169) ; but Mosheim (Hist Eccles. p. 244) shows the futility of their opinion, 
and inclines to believe it spurious. Yet Abulpharagius quotes the impostors

p. 418) ; but Abulpharagius was primate of the Jacobites.

to the temporal and spiritual fatigues of his mission. His epileptic fits, 
an absurd calumny of the Greeks, would be an object of pity rather 
than abhorrence; 104 but he seriously believed that he was poisoned at 
Chaibar by the revenge of a Jewish female. 188 During four years the 
health of die prophet declined; his infirmities increased; but his mortal 
disease was a fever of fourteen days, which deprived him by intervals 
of the use of reason. As soon as he was conscious of his danger, he 
edified his brethren by the humility of his virtue or penitence. " If 
there be any man," said the apostle from the pulpit, " whom I have 
unjustly scourged, I submit my own back to the lash of retaliation. 
Have I aspersed the reputation of a Musulman? let him proclaim my 
faults in the face of the congregation. Has any one been despoiled of 
his goods? the little that I possess shall compensate the principal and 
the interest of the debt." " Yes," replied a voice from the crowd, " I 
am entitled to three drachms of silver." Mohammed heard the com- 
plaint, satisfied the demand, and thanked his creditor for accusing him 
in this world rather than at the day of judgment. He beheld with 
temperate firmness the approach of death; enfranchised his slaves 
(seventeen men, as they are named, and eleven women); minutely 
directed the order of his funeral; and moderated the lamentations of his 
weeping friends, on whom he bestowed the benediction of peace. Till 
the third day before his death he regularly performed the function of 
public prayer: the choice of Abubeker to supply his place appeared to 
mark that ancient and faithful friend as his successor in the sacerdotal 
and regal office; but he prudently declined the risk and envy of a more 
explicit nomination. At a moment when his faculties were visibly im- 
paired, he called for pen and ink to write, or, more properly, to dictate, 
a divine book, the sum and accomplishment of all his revelations: a 
dispute arose in the chamber whether he should be allowed to supersede 
the authority of the Koran; and the prophet was forced to reprove the 
indecent vehemence of his disciples. If the slightest credit may be 
afforded to the traditions of his wives and companions, he maintained, 
in the bosom of his family, and to the last moments of his life, the 
dignity of an apostle, and the faith of an enthusiast; described the 
visits of Gabriel, who bid an everlasting farewell to the earth; and ex- 
pressed his lively confidence, not only of the mercy, but of the favour, 

"*The epilepsy, or falling sickness of Mohammed, is asserted by Theoph- 
anes, Zonaras, and the rest of. the Greeks; and is greedily swallowed by 
the gross bigotry of Hottinger (Hist. Orient p. 10, n), Prideaux (Life of 
Mahomet, p. 12), and Maracci (torn. ii. Alcoran, p. 762, 763). The titles 
(the wrapped-up, the covered) of two chapters of the Koran (73, 74) can 
hardly be strained to such an interpretation : the silence, the ignorance of the 
Mohammedan commentators, is more conclusive than the most peremptory 
denial; and the charitable side is espoused by Ockley (Hist, of the Saracens, 
torn. i. p. 301), Gagnier (ad Abulfedam, p. 9; Vie de Mahomet, torn. i. p. 118), 
and Sale (Koran, p. 469-474). 

m This poison (more ignominious since it was offered as a test of his 
prophetic knowledge) is frankly confessed by his zealous votaries, Abulfeda

of the Supreme Being. In a familiar discourse he had mentioned his 
special prerogative, that the angel of death was not allowed to take 
his soul till he had respectfully asked the permission of the prophet. 
The request was granted; and Mohammed immediately fell into the 
agony of his dissolution: his head was reclined on the lap of Ayesha, 
the best beloved of all his wives; he fainted with the violence of pain; 
recovering his spirits, he raised his eyes towards the roof of the house, 
and, with a steady look, though a faltering voice, uttered the last broken, 
though articulate, words: " O God I . . . pardon my sins. . . . Yes . . . 
I come . . . among my fellow citizens on high;" and thus peaceably 
expired on a carpet spread upon the floor. An expedition for the con- 
quest of Syria was stopped by this mournful event: the army halted 
at the gates of Medina; the chiefs were assembled round their dying 
master. The city, more especially the house, of the prophet, was a scene 
of clamorous sorrow or silent despair: fanaticism alone could suggest 
a ray of hope and consolation. " How can he be dead, our witness, our 
intercessor, our mediator, with God? By God he is not dead: like Moses 
and Jesus, he is wrapt in a holy trance, and speedily will he return to 
his faithful people." The evidence of sense was disregarded; and 
Omar, unsheathing his scimitar, threatened to strike off the heads of the 
infidels who should dare to affirm that the prophet was no more. The 
tumult was appeased by the weight and moderation of Abubeker. " Is 
it Mohammed," said he to Omar and the multitude, " or the God of 
Mohammed, whom you worship? The God of Mohammed liveth for 
ever; but the apostle was a mortal like ourselves, and, according to his 
own prediction, he has experienced the common fate of mortality." He 
was piously interred by the hands of his nearest kinsman, on the same 
spot on which he expired: 1 * 6 Medina has been sanctified by the death 
and burial of Mohammed; and the innumerable pilgrims of Mecca 
often turn aside from the way, to bow, in voluntary devotion, 167 before 
the simple tomb of the prophet. 168 

m The Greeks and Latins have invented and propagated the vulgar and 
ridiculous story that Mohammed's iron tomb is suspended in the g air at 
Mecca (trfjpa twtopi.&amp;fuvov. LaonicuS Chalcocondyles de Rebus Turcicis, L iii. 
p. 66 [ed. Par.; p. 126, ed. Bonn.]), by the action of equal and potent load- 
stones (Dictionnaire de Bayle, MAHOMET, Rem. EE. FF.). Without any philo- 
sophical inquiries, it may suffice, that, i. The prophet was not buried at 
Mecca; and, 2. That his tomb 'at Medina, which has been visited by millions, 
is placed on the ground (Reland, de Relig. Moham. L ii. c. 19, p. 209-211; 
Gagnier, Vie de Mahomet, torn. iii. p. 263-268). 

[Most of the biographers of Mohammed state that he died on Monday 
the I2th Rabia-1-Awwl, in the year 11 of the Hegira, which answers to the 
7th June, 632. This, however, fell on a Sunday. But as a contemporary 
poem mentions the day of his death as Monday, it is probable that a mistake 
has been made in the day of the month, and that he died on the 8th. O. S.] 

MT A1 Tannabi enumerates (Vie de Mahomet, torn. iii. p. 372-391) the 
multifarious duties of a pilgrim who visits the tombs of the prophet and his 
companions; and the learned casuist decides that this act of devotion is 
nearest in obligation and merit to a divine precept The doctors are divided

ri4 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

At the conclusion of the life of Mohammed it may perhaps be ex- 
pected that I should balance his faults and virtues, that I should decide 
whether the title of enthusiast or impostor more properly belongs to 
that extraordinary man. Had I been intimately conversant with the 
son of Abdallah, the task would still be difficult, and the success un- 
certain: at the distance of twelve centuries I darkly contemplate his 
shade through a cloud of religious incense; and could I truly delineate 
the portrait of an hour, the fleeting resemblance would not equally apply 
to the solitary of Mount Hera, to the preacher of Mecca, and to the 
conqueror of Arabia. The author of a mighty revolution appears to 
have been endowed with a pious and contemplative disposition: so soon 
as marriage had raised him above the pressure of want, he avoided the 
oaths of ambition and avarice; and till the age of forty he lived with 
innocence, and would have died without a name. The unity of God 
is an idea most congenial to nature and reason; and a slight conversa- 
tion with the Jews and Christians would teach him to despise and detest 
the idolatry of Mecca. It was the duty of a man and a citizen to impart 
the doctrine of salvation, to rescue his country from the dominion of 
sin and error. The energy of a mind incessantly bent on the same 
object would convert a general obligation into a particular call; the 
warm suggestions of the understanding or the fancy would be felt as 
the inspirations of Heaven; the labour of thought would expire in rap- 
ture and vision; and the inward sensation, the invisible monitor, would 
be described with the form and attributes of an angel of God. 160 From 
enthusiasm to imposture the step is perilous and slippery; the demon 
of Socrates 170 affords a memorable instance how a wise man may 
deceive himself, how a good man may deceive others, how the conscience

received from Ayesha, Ali, the sons of Abbas, etc.; and as they dwelt at 
Medina, and survived the prophet many years, they might repeat the pious 
tale to a second or third generation of pilgrims. 

. 1( *The Christians, rashly enough, have assigned to Mohammed a tame 
pigeon, that seemed to descend from heaven and whisper in his ear. As 
this pretended miracle is urged by Grotius (de Veritate Religionis Christiana), 
his Arabic translator, the learned Pocock, inquired of him the names of his 
authors; and Grotius confessed that it is unknown to the Mohammedans 
themselves. Lest it should provoke their indignation and laughter, the ^pious 
lie is suppressed in the Arabic version; but it has maintained an edifying 
place in the numerous editions of the Latin text (Pocock, Specimen Hist 
Arabum, p. 186, 187; Reland, de Religion. Moham. 1. ii. c. 39, P- 259-262).

may slumber in a mixed and middle state between self-illusion and 
voluntary fraud. Charity may believe that the original motives of Mo- 
hammed were those of pure and genuine benevolence; but a human 
missionary is incapable of cherishing the obstinate unbelievers who 
reject his claims, despise his arguments, and persecute his life; he might 
forgive his personal adversaries, he may lawfully hate the enemies of 
God; the stern passions of pride and revenge were kindled in the bosoir 
of Mohammed, and he sighed, like the prophet of Nineveh, for the 
destruction of the rebels whom he had condemned. The injustice oi 
Mecca and the choice of Medina transformed the citizen into a prince, 
the humble preacher into the leader of armies; but his sword was con- 
secrated by the example of the saints; and the same God who afflicts 
a sinful world with pestilence and earthquakes might inspire for their 
conversion or chastisement the valour of his servants. In the exercise 
of political government he was compelled to abate of the stern rigour 
of fanaticism, to comply in some measure with the prejudices and 
passions of his followers, and to employ even the vices of mankind as 
the instruments of their salvation. The use of fraud and perfidy, of 
cruelty and injustice, were often subservient to the propagation of the 
faith; and Mohammed commanded or approved the assassination of the 
Jews and idolaters who had escaped from the field of battle. By the 
repetition of such acts the character of Mohammed must have been 
gradually stained; and the influence of such pernicious habits would 
be poorly compensated by the practice of the personal and social virtues 
which are necessary to maintain the reputation of a prophet among his 
sectaries and friends. Of his last years ambition was the ruling passion; 
and a politician will suspect that he secretly smiled (the victorious im- 
postor 1) at the enthusiasm of his youth, and the credulity of his 
proselytes. 171 A philosopher will observe that their credulity and his 
success would tend more strongly to fortify the assurance of his divine 
mission, that his interest and religion were inseparably connected, and 
that his conscience would be soothed by the persuasion that he alone 
was absolved by the Deity from the obligation of positive and moral 
laws. If he retained any vestige of his native innocence, the sins of 
Mohammed may be allowed as an evidence of his sincerity. In the 
support of truth, the arts of fraud and fiction may be deemed less 
criminal; and he would have started at the foulness of the means, had 
he not been satisfied of the importance and justice of the end. Even 
in a conqueror or a priest I can surprise a word or action of unaffected 
humanity; and the decree of Mohammed, that, in the sale of captives, 
the mothers should never be separated from their children, may suspend^ 
or moderate, the censure of the historian. 172

u6 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

The good sense of Mohammed 173 despised the pomp of royalty; the 
apostle of God submitted to the menial offices of the family; he kindled 
the fire, swept the floor, milked the ewes, and mended with his own 
hands his shoes and his woollen garment. Disdaining the penance and 
merit of a hermit, he observed, without effort or vanity, the abstemious 
diet of an Arab and a soldier. On solemn occasions he feasted his com- 
panions with rustic and hospitable plenty; but in his domestic life many 
weeks would elapse without a fire being kindled on the hearth of the 
prophet. The interdiction of wine was confirmed by his example; his 
hunger was appeased with a sparing allowance of barley-bread: he de- 
lighted in the taste of milk and honey; but his ordinary food consisted 
of dates and water. Perfumes and women were the two sensual enjoy- 
ments which his nature required, and his religion did not forbid; and 
Mohammed affirmed that the fervour of his devotion was increased by 
these innocent pleasures. The heat of the climate inflames the blood of 
the Arabs, and their libidinous complexion has been noticed by the 
writers of antiquity. 174 Their incontinence was regulated by the civil 
and religious laws of the Koran: their incestuous alliances were blamed: 
the boundless licence of polygamy was reduced to four legitimate wives 
or concubines; their rights both of bed and of dowry were equitably 
determined; the freedom of divorce was discouraged; adultery was con- 
demned as a capital offence; and fornication, in either sex, was punished 
with a hundred stripes. 175 Such were the calm and rational precepts of 
the legislator; but in his private conduct Mohammed indulged the 
appetites of a man, and abused the claims of a prophet. A special rev- 
elation dispensed him from the laws which he had imposed on his 
nation; the female sex, without reserve, was abandoned to his desires; 
and this singular prerogative excited the envy rather than the scandal, 
the veneration rather than the envy, of the devout Musulmans. If we 
remember the seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines of 
the wise Solomon, we shall applaud the modesty of the Arabian, who 
espoused no more than seventeen or fifteen wives; eleven are enu- 
merated who occupied at Medina their separate apartments round the 
house of the apostle, and enjoyed in their turns the favour of his con- 
prophet, and the murders of Caab and Sophian, which he prompted and ap- 
proved (Vie de Mahomet, torn. ii. p. 69, 97, 208). 

111 For the domestic life of Mohammed, consult Gagnier, and the correspond- 
ing chapters of Abulfeda ; for his diet (torn. iii. p. 285-288) ; his children 
(p. 189, 289) ; his wives (p. 290-303) ; his marriage with Zeineb (torn. ii. 
p. 152-160) ; his amour with Mary (p. 303-309) ; the false accusation of Ayesha 
(p. 186-199). The most original evidence of the three last transactions is 
contained in the twenty-fourth, thirty-third, and sixty-sixth chapters of the 
Koran, with Sale's Commentary. Prideaux (Life of Mahomet, p. 80-90) and 
Maracci (Prodrom. Alcoran, part iv. p. 49-59) have maliciously exaggerated 
the frailties of Mohammed.

jugal society. What is singular enough, they were all widows, excepting 
only Ayesha, the daughter of Abubeker. She was doubtless a virgin, 
since Mohammed consummated his nuptials (such is the premature 
ripeness of the climate) when she was only nine years of age. The 
youth, the beauty, the spirit of Ayesha gave her a superior ascendant: 
she was beloved and trusted by the prophet; and, after his death, the 
daughter of Abubeker was long revered as the mother of the faithful. 
Her behavior had been ambiguous and indiscreet: in a nocturnal march 
she was accidentally left behind, and in the morning Ayesha returned 
to the camp with a man. The temper of Mohammed was inclined to 
jealousy; but a divine revelation assured him of her innocence: he chas- 
tised her accusers, and published a law of domestic peace, that no 
woman should be condemned unless four male witnesses had seen her 
in the act of adultery. 178 In his adventures with Zeineb, the wife of 
Zeid, and with Mary, an Egyptian captive, the amorous prophet forgot 
the interest of his reputation. At the house of Zeid, his freedman and 
adopted son, he beheld, in a loose undress, the beauty of Zeineb, and 
burst forth into an ejaculation of devotion and desire. The servile, or 
grateful, freedman understood the hint, and yielded without hesitation 
to the love of his benefactor. But as the filial relation had excited some 
doubt and scandal, the angel Gabriel descended from heaven to ratify 
the deed, to annul the adoption, and gently to reprove the apostle for 
distrusting the indulgence of his God. One of his wives, Hafna, the 
daughter of Omar, surprised him on her own bed in the embraces of his 
Egyptian captive: she promised secrecy and forgiveness: he swore that 
he would renounce the possession of Mary. Both parties forgot their 
engagements; and Gabriel again descended with a chapter of the Koran 
to absolve him from his oath, and to exhort him freely to enjoy his 
captives and concubines without listening to the clamours of his wives. 
In a solitary retreat of thirty days he laboured alone with Mary to ful- 
fill the commands of the angel. When his love and revenge were 
satiated, he summoned to his presence his eleven wives, reproached their 
disobedience and indiscretion, and threatened them with a sentence of 
divorce, both in this world and in the next a dreadful sentence, since 
those who had ascended the bed of the prophet were for ever excluded 
from the hope of a second marriage. Perhaps the incontinence of 
Mohammed may be palliated by the tradition of his natural or preter- 
natural gifts: 177 he united the manly virtue of thirty of the children of

dence was of no avail ; and that all the four witnesses must have actually seen

Adam; and the apostle might rival the thirteenth labour 178 of the 
Grecian Hercules. 179 A more serious and decent excuse may be drawn 
from his fidelity to Cadijah. During the twenty-four years of their 
marriage her youthful husband abstained from the right of polygamy, 
and the pride or tenderness of the venerable matron was never insulted 
by the society of a rival. After her death he placed her in the rank of 
the four perfect women, with the sister of Moses, the mother of Jesus, 
and Fatima, the best beloved of his daughters. " Was she not old? " 
said Ayesha, with the insolence of a blooming beauty; " has not God 
given you a better in her place? " " No, by God," said Mohammed, 
with an effusion of honest gratitude, " there never can be a better 1 She 
believed in me when men despised me; she relieved my wants when I 
was poor and persecuted by the world." 18 

In the largest indulgence of polygamy, the founder of a religion and 
empire might aspire to multiply the chances of a numerous posterity 
and a lineal succession. The hopes of Mohammed were fatally disap- 
pointed. The virgin Ayesha, and his ten widows of mature age and 
approved fertility, were barren in his potent embraces. The four sons 
of Cadijah died in their infancy. Miry, his Egyptian concubine, was 
endeared to him by the birth of Ibrahim. At the end of fifteen months 
the prophet wept over his grave; but he sustained with firmness the 
raillery of his enemies, and checked the adulation or credulity of the 
Moslems by the assurance that an eclipse of the sun was not occasioned 
by the death of the infant. Cadijah had likewise given him four daugh- 
ters, who were married to the most faithful of his disciples: the three 
eldest died before their father; but Fatima, who possessed his confi- 
dence and love, became the wife of her cousin Ali, and the mother of 
an illustrious progeny. The merit and misfortunes of Ali and his de- 
scendants will lead me to anticipate, in this place, the series of the 
Saracen caliphs, a title which describes the commanders of the faithful 
as the vicars and successors of the apostle of God. 181

181 This outline of the Arabian history is drawn from the Bibliotheque 
Orientate of D'Herbelot (under the names of Aboubecre, Omar, Othman, Ati, 
etc.), from the Annals of Abulfeda, Abulpharagius, and Elmacin (under the 
proper years of the Hcgira), and especially from Ockley*s History of the 
Saracens (vol. i. p. i-io, 115-122, 229, 249, 363-3/2, 378-39*, and almost the 
whole of the second volume). Yet we should weigh with caution the tradi- 
tions of the hostile sects; a stream which becomes still more muddy as it 
flows farther from the source. Sir John Chardin has too faithfully copied 
the fables and errors of the modern Persians (Voyages, torn. ii. p. 235- 
850, etc.). 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE ii&lt;) 

The birth, the alliance, the character of Ali, which exalted him above 
the rest of his countrymen, might justify his daim to the vacant throne 
of Arabia. The son of Abu Taleb was, in his own right, the chief of 
the family of Hashem, and the hereditary prince or guardian of the city 
and temple of Mecca. The light of prophecy was extinct; but the hus- 
band of Fatima might expect the inheritance and blessing of her father: 
the Arabs had sometimes been patient of a female reign; and the two 
grandsons of the prophet had often been fondled in his lap, and shown 
in his pulpit, as the hope of his age, and the chief of the youth of para- 
dise. The first of the true believers might aspire to march before them 
in this world and in the next; and if some were of a graver and more 
rigid cast, the zeal and virtue of Ali were never outstripped by any 
recent proselyte. He united the qualifications of a poet, a soldier, and 
a saint: his wisdom still breathes in a collection of moral and religious 
sayings; 182 and every antagonist, in the combats of the tongue or of 
the sword, was subdued by his eloquence and valour. From the first 
hour of his mission to the last rites of his funeral, the apostle was never 
forsaken by a generous friend, whom he delighted to name his brother, 
his vicegerent, and the faithful Aaron of a second Moses. The son of 
Abu Taleb was afterwards reproached for neglecting to secure his inter- 
est by a solemn declaration of his right, which would have silenced all 
competition, and sealed his succession by the decrees of Heaven. But 
the unsuspecting hero confided in himself: the jealousy of empire, and 
perhaps the fear of opposition, might suspend the resolutions of Moham- 
med; and the bed of sickness was besieged by the artful Ayesha, the 
daughter of Abubeker; and the enemy of Ali. 

The silence and death of the prophet restored the liberty of the 
people; and his companions convened an assembly to deliberate on the 
choice of his successor. The hereditary daim and lofty spirit of Ali 
were offensive to an aristocracy of elders, desirous of bestowing and 
resuming the sceptre by a free and frequent election: the Koreish could 
never be reconciled to the proud pre-eminence of the line of Hashem: 
the ancient discord of the tribes was rekindled; the fugitives of Mecca 
and the auxiliaries of Medina asserted their respective merits; and the 
rash proposal of choosing two independent caliphs would have crushed 
in their infancy the religion and empire of the Saracens. The tumult 
was appeased by the disinterested resolution of Omar, who, suddenly 
renouncing his own pretensions, stretched forth his hand and dedared 
himself the first subject of the mild and venerable Abubeker. The 
urgency of the moment, and the acquiescence of the people, might 
excuse this illegal and precipitate measure; but Omar himself confessed 
from the pulpit, that, if any Musulman should hereafter presume to 
anticipate the suffrage of his brethren, both the elector and the elected 

188 Ockley (at the end of his second volume) has given an English version 
of 169 sentences, which he ascribes, with some hesitation, to Ali, the son of 
Abu Taleb. His preface is coloured by the enthusiasm of a translator; yet 
these sentences delineate a characteristic, though dark, picture of human life. 



130 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

would be worthy of death. 183 After the simple inauguration of Abu- 
beker, he was obeyed in Medina, Mecca, and the provinces of Arabia: 
the Hashemites alone declined the oath of fidelity; and their chief, in 
his own house, maintained above six months a sullen and independent 
reserve, without listening to the threats of Omar, who attempted to 
consume with fire the habitation of the daughter of the apostle. The 
death of Fatima, and the decline of his party, subdued the indignant 
spirit of Ali: he condescended to salute the commander of the faithful, 
accepted his excuse of the necessity of preventing their common enemies, 
and wisely rejected his courteous offer of abdicating the government of 
tke Arabians. After a reign of two years the aged caliph was summoned 
by the angel of death. In his testament, with the tacit approbation of 
the companions, he bequeathed the sceptre to the firm and intrepid 
virtue of Omar. " I have no occasion," said the modest candidate, " for 
the place." " But the place has occasion for you," replied Abubeker; 
who expired with a fervent prayer that the God of Mohammed would 
ratify his choice, and direct the Musulmans in the way of concord and 
obedience. The prayer was not ineffectual, since Ali himself, in a life 
of privacy and prayer, professed to revere the superior worth and dig- 
nity of his rival, who comforted him for the loss of empire by the most 
flattering marks of confidence and esteem. In the twelfth year of his 
reign Omar received a mortal wound from the hand of an assassin: he 
rejected with equal impartiality the names of his son and of Ali, refused 
to load his conscience with the sins of his successor, and devolved on six 
of the most respectable companions the arduous task of electing a com- 
mander of the faithful. On this occasion Ali was again blamed by his 
friends 18 * for submitting his right to the judgment of men, for recog- 
nising their jurisdiction by accepting a place among the six electors. 
He might have obtained their suffrage had he deigned to promise a 
strict and servile conformity, not only to the Koran and tradition, but 
likewise to the determinations of two seniors* With these limitations, 
Othman, the secretary of Mohammed, accepted the government; nor 
was it till after the third caliph, twenty-four years after the death of the 
prophet, that Ali was invested by the popular choice with the regal and 
sacerdotal office. The manners of the Arabians retained their primitive 

183 Ockley (Hist of the Saracens, vol. i. p. 5, 6) from an Arabian MS. repre- 
sents Ayesha as adverse to the substitution of her father in the place of the 
apostle. This fact, so improbable in itself, is unnoticed by Abulfeda, Al 
Jannabi, and Al Bochari, the last of whom quotes the tradition of Ayesha 
herself (Vit. Mohammed, p. 136; Vie de Mahomet, torn. iii. p. 236).

died A.D. 687, with the title of grand doctor of the Moslems. In Abulfeda

inops boni consilii, et rerum gerendarum parum callens. 

W I suspect that the two seniors (Abulpharagius, p. 115; Ockley, torn. L

THE ROMAN EMPIRE MX 

simplicity, and the son of Abu Taleb despised the pomp and vanity of 
this world. At the hour of prayer he repaired to the mosch of Medina, 
clothed in a thin cotton gown, a coarse turban on his head, his slippers 
in one hand, and his bow in the other, instead of a walking-staff. The 
companions of the prophet and the chiefs of the tribe saluted their new 
sovereign, and gave him their right hands as a sign of fealty and 
allegiance. 

The mischiefs that flow from the contests of ambition are usually 
confined to the times and countries in which they have been agitated. 
But the religious discord of the friends and enemies of Ali has been 
renewed in every age of the Hegira, and is still maintained in the im- 
mortal haired of the Persians and Turks. 186 The former, who are 
branded with the appellation of Skiites or sectaries, have enriched the 
Mohammedan creed with a new article of faith; and if Mohammed be 
the apostle, his companion Ali is the vicar, of God. In their private 
converse, in their public worship, they bitterly execrate the three usurp- 
ers who intercepted his indefeasible right to the dignity of Imam and 
Caliph; and the name of Omar expresses in their tongue the perfect 
accomplishment of wickedness and impiety. 187 The Sonnites, who are 
supported by the general consent and orthodox tradition of the Musul- 
mans, entertain a more impartial, or at least a more decent, opinion. 
They respect the memory of Abubeker, Omar, Othman, and Ali, the 
holy and legitimate successors of the prophet. But they assign the last 
and most humble place to the husband of Fatima, in the persuasion 
that the order of succession was determined by the degrees of sanc- 
tity. 188 An historian who balances the four caliphs with a hand un- 
shaken by superstition will calmly pronounce that their manners were 
alike pure and exemplary; that their zeal was fervent, and probably 
sincere; and that, in the midst of riches and power, their lives wer&lt; 
devoted to the practice of moral and religious duties. But the public 
virtues of Abubeker and Omar, the prudence of the first, the severity of 
the second, maintained the peace and prosperity of their reigns. The 
feeble temper and declining age of Othman were incapable of sustaining 
the weight of conquest and empire. He chose, and he was deceived; he

attempt of Nadir Shah to change the religion of the nation (see his Persian

Persians shoot with the bow, they frequently cry, "May this arrow go to

"'This gradation of merit is distinctly marked in a creed illustrated by 
Reland (de Relig. Mohamm. 1. i. p. 37) ; and a Sonnite argument inserted 
by Ockley (Hist, of the Saracens, torn. ii. p. 230). The practice of cursing 
the memory of Ali was abolished, after forty years, by tike Ommiades them- 
selves (D'Herbelot, p. 690) ; and there are few among the Turks who presume 
to revile him as an infidel (Voyages de Chardin, torn. iv. p. 46). 



12* THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

trusted, and he was betrayed: the most deserving of the faithful became 
useless or hostile to his government, and his lavish bounty was pro- 
ductive only of ingratitude and discontent. The spirit of discord went 
forth in the provinces: their deputies assembled at Medina; and the 
Charegites, the desperate fanatics who disclaimed the yoke of subordina- 
tion and reason, were confounded among the free-born Arabs, who 
demanded the redress of their wrongs and the punishment of their op- 
pressors. From Cufa, from Bassora, from Egypt, from the tribes of the 
desert, they rose in arms, encamped about a league from Medina, and 
despatched a haughty mandate to their sovereign, requiring him to 
execute justice or to descend from the throne. His repentance began 
to disarm and disperse the insurgents; but their fury was rekindled by 
the arts of his enemies; and the forgery of a perfidious secretary was 
contrived to blast his reputation and precipitate his fall. The caliph 
had lost the only guard of his predecessors, the esteem and confidence 
of the Moslems: during a siege of six weeks his water and provisions 
were intercepted, and the feeble gates of the palace were protected only 
by the scruples of the more timorous rebels. Forsaken by those who 
had abused his simplicity, the helpless and venerable caliph expected 
the approach of death: the brother of Ayesha marched at the head of 
the assassins; and Othman, with the Koran in his lap, was pierced with 
a multitude of wounds. A tumultuous anarchy of five days was ap- 
peased by the inauguration of Ali: his refusal would have provoked a 
general massacre. In this painful situation he supported the becoming 
pride of the chief ot the Hashemites; declared that he had rather serve 
than reign; rebuked the presumption of the strangers; and required the 
formal if not the voluntary assent of the chiefs of the nation. He has 
never been accused of prompting the assassin of Omar; though Persia 
indiscreetly celebrates the festival of that holy martyr. The quarrel 
between Othman and his subjects was assuaged by the early media- 
tion of Ali; and Hassan, the eldest of his sons, was insulted and 
wounded in the defence of the caliph. Yet it is doubtful whether the 
father of Hassan was strenuous and sincere in his opposition to the 
rebels; and it is certain that he enjoyed the benefit of their crime. The 
temptation was indeed of such magnitude as might stagger and corrupt 
the most obdurate virtue. The ambitious candidate no longer aspired 
to the barren sceptre of Arabia; the Saracens had been victorious in the 
East and West; and the wealthy kingdoms of Persia, Syria, and Egypt 
were the patrimony of the commander of the faithful. 

A life of prayer and contemplation had not chilled the martial activity 
of Ali; but in a mature age, after a long experience of mankind, he still 
betrayed in his conduct the rashness and indiscretion of youth. In the 
first days of his reign he neglected to secure, either by gifts or fetters, 
the doubtful allegiance of Telha and Zobeir, two of the most powerful 
of the Arabian chiefs. They escaped from Medina to Mecca, and from 
thence to Bassora; erected the standard of revolt; and usurped the gov- 
ernment of Irak, or Assyria, which they had vainly solicited as the

reward of their services. The mask of patriotism is allowed to cover 
the most glaring inconsistencies; and the enemies, perhaps the assassins, 
of Othman now demanded vengeance for his blood. They were accom- 
panied in their flight by Ayesha, the widow of the prophet, who cher- 
ished to the last hour of her life an implacable hatred against the 
husband and the posterity of Fatima. The most reasonable Moslems 
were scandalised that the mother of the faithful should expose in a camp 
her person and character; but the superstitious crowd was confident that 
her presence would sanctify the justice and assure the success of their 
cause. At the head of twenty thousand of his loyal Arabs, and nine 
thousand valiant auxiliaries of Cufa, the caliph encountered and de&lt; 
feated the superior numbers of the rebels under the walls of Bassora. 
Their leaders, Telha and Zobeir, were slain in the first battle that 
stained with civil blood the arms of the Moslems. After passing through 
the ranks to animate the troops, Ayesha had chosen her post amidst the 
dangers of the field. In the heat of the action, seventy men who held 
the bridle of her camd were successively killed or wounded; and the 
cage, or litter, in which she sat was stuck with javelins and darts like 
the quills of a porcupine. The venerable captive sustained with firm- 
ness the reproaches of the conqueror, and was speedily dismissed to her 
proper station, at the tomb of Mohammed, with the respect and tender- 
ness that was still due to the widow of the apostle. After this victory, 
which was styled the Day of the Camel, All inarched against a more 
formidable adversary; against Moawiyah, the son of Abu Sophian, who 
had assumed the title of caliph, and whose daim was supported by the 
forces of Syria and the interest of the house of Ommijrah. From the 
passage of Thapsacus, the plain of Siffin 189 extends along the Western 
bank of the Euphrates. On this spacious and level theatre the two 
competitors waged a desultory war of one hundred and ten days. In 
the course of ninety actions or skirmishes, the loss of Ali was estimated 
at twenty-five, that of Moawiyah at forty-five, thousand .soldiers; and 
the list of the slain was dignified with the names of five-and-twenty 
veterans who had fought at Beder under the standard of Mohammed. 
In this sanguinary contest the lawful caliph displayed a superior char- 
acter of valour and humanity. His troops were strictly enjoined to 
await the first onset of the enemy, to spare their flying brethren, and to 
respect the bodies of the dead, and the chastity of the female captives. 
He generously proposed to save the blood of the Moslems by a single 
combat; but his trembling rival declined the challenge as a sentence of 
inevitable death. The ranks of the Syrians were broken by the charge 
of a hero who was mounted on a piebald horse, and wielded with irre- 
sistible force his ponderous and two-edged sword. As aften as he smote 
a rebel, he shouted the Allah Acbar, " God is victorious I " and in the 
tumult of a nocturnal battle he was heard to repeat four hundred times 
that tremendous exclamation. The prince of Damascus already inedi-

tated his flight; but the certain victory was snatched from the grasp of 
Ali by the disobedience and enthusiasm of his troops. Their conscience 
was awed by the solemn appeal to the books of the Koran which 
Moawiyah exposed on the forem&amp;st lances; and Ali was compelled to 
yield to a disgraceful truce and an insidious compromise. He retreated 
with sorrow and indignation to Cufa; his party was discouraged; the 
distant provinces of Persia, of Yemen, and of Egypt were subdued or 
seduced by his crafty rival; and the stroke of fanaticism, which was 
aimed against the three chiefs of the nation, was fatal only to the cousin 
of Mohammed. In the temple of Mecca three Charegites or enthusiasts 
discoursed of the disorders of the church and state: they soon agreed 
that the deaths of Ali, of Moawiyah, and of his friend Amrou, the vice- 
roy of Egypt, would restore the peace and unity of religion. Each of 
the assassins chose his victim, poisoned his dagger, devoted his life, and 
secretly repaired to the scene of action. Their resolution was equally 
desperate: but the first mistook the person of Amrou, and stabbed the 
deputy who occupied his seat; the prince of Damascus was dangerously 
hurt by the second; the lawful caliph, in the mosch of Cufa, received a 
mortal wound from the hand of the third. He expired in the sixty-third 
year of his age, and mercifully recommended to his children that they 
would despatch the murderer by a single stroke. The sepulchre of 
Ali 190 was concealed from the tyrants of the house of Ommiyah; 191 but 
in the fourth age of the Hegira, a tomb, a temple, a city, arose near the 
ruins of Cufa. 182 Many thousands of the Shiites repose in holy ground 
at the feet of the vicar of God; and the desert is vivified by the numer- 
ous and annual visits of the Persians, who esteem their devotion not 
less meritorious than the pilgrimage of Mecca. 

The persecutors of Mohammed usurped the inheritance of his chil- 
dren; and the champions of idolatry became the supreme heads of his 
religion and empire. The opposition of Abu Sophian had been fierce 
and obstinate; his conversion was tardy and reluctant; his new faith 
was fortified by necessity and interest; he served, he fought, perhaps 
he believed; and the sins of the time of ignorance were expiated by the 
recent merits of the family of Ommiyah. Moawiyah, the son of Abu 
Sophian, and of the cruel Henda, was dignified in his early youth with 

*Abulfeda, a moderate Sonnite, relates the different opinions concerning 
the burial of Ali, but adopts the sepulchre of Cufa, hodie fama numeroque 
religiose frequentantium celebratum. This number is reckoned by Niebuhr 
to amount annually to 2000 of the dead and 5000 of the living (torn, ii, 
p. 208, 209). 

"* All the tyrants of Persia, from Adhad el Dowlat (A.D. 977, D'HerJbelot, 
P- 58, 59, 95) to Nadir Shah (A.D. 1743, Hist, de Nadir Shah, torn. ii. p. 155), 
have enriched the tomb of Ali with the spoils of the people. The dome is 
copper, with a bright and massy gilding, which glitters to the sun at the 
distance of many a mile. 

"The city of Meshed Ali, five or six miles from the ruins of Cufa, and one 
hundred and twenty to the south of Bagdad, is of the size and form of the 
modern Jerusalem. Meshed Hosein, larger and more populous, is at the 
distance of thirty miles.

the office or title of secretary of the prophet: the judgment of Omar 
intrusted him with the government of Syria; and he administered that 
important province above forty years, either in a subordinate or supreme 
rank. Without renouncing the fame of valour and liberality, he affected 
the reputation of humanity and moderation: a grateful people was 
attached to their benefactor; and the victorious Moslems were enriched 
with the spoils of Cyprus and Rhodes. The sacred duty of pursuing 
the assassins of Othman was the engine and pretence of his ambition. 
The bloody shirt of the martyr was exposed in the mosch of Damascus: 
the emir deplored the fate of his injured kinsman; and sixty thousand 
Syrians were engaged in his service by an oath of fidelity and revenge. 
Amrou, the conqueror of Egypt, himself an army, was the first who 
saluted the new monarch, and divulged the dangerous secret that the 
Arabian caliphs might be created elsewhere than in the city of the 
prophet. 193 The policy of Moawiyah eluded the valour of his rival; and, 
after the death of Ali, he negotiated the abdication of his son Hassan, 
whose mind was either above or below the government of the world, 
and who retired without a sigh from the palace of Cufa to a humble 
cell near .the tomb of his grandfather. The aspiring wishes of the caliph 
were finally crowned by the important change of an elective to an heredi- 
tary kingdom. Some murmurs of freedom or fanaticism attested the 
reluctance of the Arabs, and four citizens of Medina refused the oath 
of fidelity; but the designs of Moawiyah were conducted with vigour 
and address; and his son Yezid, a feeble and dissolute youth, was pro- 
claimed as the commander of the faithful and the successor of the 
apostle of God. 

A familiar story is related of the benevolence of one of the sons of 
Ali. In serving at table a slave had inadvertently dropped a dish of 
scalding broth on his master: the heedless wretch fell prostrate, to 
deprecate his punishment, and repeated a verse of the Koran: " Para- 
dise is for those who command their anger: " " I am not angry: " 
" and for those who pardon offences: " " I pardon your offence: " . 
" and for those who return good for evil: " "I give you your liberty. 
and four hundred pieces of silver." With an equal measure of piety, 
Hosein, the younger brother of Hassan, inherited a remnant of Ids 
father's spirit, and served with honour against the Christians in the 
siege of Constantinople. The primogeniture of the line of Hashem, and 
the holy character of grandson of the apostle, had centered in his 
person, and he was at liberty to prosecute his claim against Yezid, the 
tyrant of Damascus, whose vices he despised, and whose title he had 
never deigned to acknowledge. A list was secretly transmitted from 
Cufa to Medina, of one hundred and forty thousand Moslems, who pro- 
fessed their attachment to his cause, and who were eager to draw their

swords so soon as he should appear on the banks of the Euphrates. 
Against the advice of his wisest friends, he resolved to trust his person 
and family in the hands of a perfidious people. He traversed the desert 
of Arabia with a timorous retinue of women and children; but as he 
approached the confines of Irak he was alarmed by the solitary or 
hostile face of the country, and suspected either the defection or ruin' 
of his party. His fears were just: Obeidollah, the governor of Cufa, 
had extinguished the first sparks of an insurrection; and Hosein, in 
the plain of Kerbela, was encompassed by a body of five thousand 
horse, who intercepted his communication with the city and the river. 
He might still have escaped to a fortress in the desert that had defied 
the power of Caesar and Chosroes, and confided in the fidelity of the 
tribe of Tai, which would have armed ten thousand warriors in his 
defence. In a conference with the chief of the enemy he proposed the 
option of three honourable conditions: that he should be allowed to 
return to Medina, or be stationed in a frontier garrison against the 
Turks, or safely conducted to the presence of Yezid. But the com- 
mands of the caliph, or his lieutenant, were stern and absolute; and 
Hosein was informed that he must either submit as a captive and a 
criminal to the commander of the faithful, or expect the consequences 
of his rebellion. "Do you think," replied he, "to terrify me with 
death? " And, during the short respite of a night, he prepared with 
calm and solemn resignation to encounter his fate. He checked the 
lamentations of his sister Fatima, who deplored the impending ruin 
of his house. " Our trust," said Hosein, " is in God alone. All things, 
both in heaven and earth, must perish and return to their Creator. My 
brother, my father, my mother, were better than me, and every Musul- 
raan has an example in the prophet." He pressed his friends to consult 
their safety by a timely flight: they unanimously refused to desert or 
survive their beloved master: and their courage was fortified by a 
fervent prayer and the assurance of paradise. On the morning of the 
fatal day, he mounted on horseback, with his sword in one hand and the 
Koran in the other: his generous band of martyrs consisted only of 
thirty-two horse and forty foot; but their flanks and rear were secured 
by the tent-ropes, and by a deep trench which they had filled with 
lighted faggots, according to the practice of the Arabs. The enemy 
advanced with reluctance, and one of their chiefs deserted, with thirty 
followers, to claim the partnership of inevitable death. In every close 
onset, or single combat, the despair of the Fatimites was invincible; 
but the surrounding multitudes galled them from a distance with a 
cloud of arrows, and the horses and men were successively slain: a 
truce was allowed on both sides for the hour of prayer; and the battle 
at length expired by the death of the last of the companions of Hosein. 
Alone, weary, and wounded, he seated himself at the door of his tent. 
As he tasted a drop of water, he was pierced in the mouth with a dart- 
and his son and nephew, two beautiful youths, were killed in his arms. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE I2 7 

He lifted his hands to heaven they were full of blood and he uttered 
a funeral prayer for the living and the dead. In a transport of despair 
his sister issued from the tent, and adjured the general of the Cufians 
that he would not sufier Hosein to be murdered before his eyes: a tear 
trickled down his venerable beard; and the boldest of his soldiers fell 
back on every side as the dying hero threw himself among them. The 
remorseless Shamer, a name detested by the faithful, reproached their 
cowardice; and the grandson of Mohammed was slain with three-and- 
thirty strokes of lances and swords. After they had trampled on his 
body, they carried his head to the castle of Cufa, and the inhuman 
Obeidollah struck him on the mouth with a cane: " Alas," exclaimed an 
aged Musulman, " on these lips have I seen the lips of the apostle of 
God! " In a distant age and climate the tragic scene of the death of 
Hosein will awaken the sympathy of the coldest reader. 104 On the 
annual festival of his martyrdom, in the devout pilgrimage to his sepul- 
chre, his Persian votaries abandon their souls to the religious frenzy 
of sorrow and indignation. 195 

When the sisters and children of Ali were brought in chains to the 
throne of Damascus, the caliph was advised to extirpate the enmity of 
a popular and hostile race, whom he had injured beyond the hope of 
reconciliation. But Yezid preferred the counsels of mercy; and the 
mourning family was honourably dismissed to mingle their tears with 
their kindred at Medina. The glory of martyrdom superseded the right 
of primogeniture; and the twelve IMAMS, 198 or pontiffs, of the Persian 
creed, are Ali, Hassan, Hosein, and the lineal descendants of Hosein 
to the ninth generation. Without arms, or treasures, or subjects, they 
successively enjoyed the veneration of the people, and provoked the 
jealousy of the reigning caliphs: their tombs, at Mecca or Medina, on 
the banks of the Euphrates, or in the province of Chorasan, are still 
visited by the devotion of their sect Their names were often the pre- 
tence qf sedition and civil war: but these royal saints despised the 
pomp of the world; submitted to the will of God and the injustice of 
man; and devoted their innocent lives to the study and practice of 
religion. The twelfth and last of the Imams, conspicuous by the title 
of Mahadi, or the Guide, surpassed the solitude and sanctity of his 
predecessors. He concealed himself in a cavern near Bagdad: the time

of little circumstances. 

Mfi Niebuhr the Dane (Voyages en Arabic, etc., torn. ii. p. 208, etc.) is, per- 
haps, the only European traveller who has dared to visit Meshed AH and 
Meshed Hosein. The two sepulchres are in the hands of the Turks, who tol- 
erate and tax the devotion of the Persian heretics. The festival of the death 
of Hosein is amply described by Sir John Chardin, a traveller whom I have 
often praised.

names.

and place of his death are unknown; and his votaries pretend that he 
still lives, and will appear before the day of judgment to overthrow 
the tyranny of Dejal, or the Antichrist. 197 In the lapse of two or three 
centuries, the posterity of Abbas, the uncle of Mohammed, had multi- 
plied to the number of thirty-three thousand: 198 the race of Ali might 
be equally prolific: the meanest individual was above the first and 
greatest of princes; and the most eminent were supposed to excel the 
perfection of angels. But their adverse fortune, and the wide extent 
of the Musulman empire, allowed an ample scope for every bold and 
artful impostor who claimed affinity with the holy seed: the sceptre of 
the Almohades, in Spain and Afric; of the Fatimites, in Egypt and 
Syria; 199 of the Sultans of Yemen; and of the Sophis of Persia; 200 has 
been consecrated by this vague and ambiguous title. Under their reigns 
it might be dangerous to dispute the legitimacy of their birth; and 
one of the Fatimite caliphs silenced an indiscreet question by drawing 
his scimitar: " This," said Moez, " is my pedigree; and these," casting 
a handful of gold to his soldiers " and these are my kindred and my 
children." In the various conditions of princes, or doctors, or nobles, or 
merchants, or beggars, a swarm of the genuine or fictitious descendants 
of Mohammed and Ali is honoured with the appellation of sheiks, or 
sherifs, or emirs. In the Ottoman empire they are distinguished by a 
green turban; receive a stipend from the treasury; are judged only by 
their chief; and, however debased by fortune or character, still assert 
the proud pre-eminence of their birth. A family of three hundred per- 
sons, the pure and orthodox branch of the caliph Hassan, is preserved 
without taint or suspicion in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and 
still retains, after the revolutions of twelve centuries, the custody of the 
temple and the sovereignty of their native land. The fame and merit 
of Mohammed would ennoble a plebeian race, and the ancient blood 

m The name of Antichrist may seem ridiculous, but the Mohammedans have 
liberally borrowed the fables of every religion (Sale's Preliminary Discourse, 
p. 80, 82). In the royal stable of Ispahan two horses were always kept 
saddled, one for the Mahadi himself, the other for his lieutenant, Jesus the 
son of Mary.

" D'Herbelot, p. 342. The enemies of the Fatimites disgraced them by

of the Koreish transcends the recent majesty of the kings of the earth. 203 
The talents of Mohammed are entitled to our applause; but his 
success has, perhaps, too strongly attracted our admiration. Are we 
surprised that a multitude of proselytes should embrace the doctrine 
and the passions of an eloquent fanatic? In the heresies of the church 
the same seduction has been tried and repeated from the time of the 
apostles to that of the reformers. Does it seein incredible that a private 
citizen should grasp the sword and the sceptre, subdue his native 
country, and erect a monarchy by his victorious arms? In the moving 
picture of the dynasties of the East, a hundred fortunate usurpers have 
arisen from a baser origin, surmounted more formidable obstacles, and 
filled a larger scope of empire and conquest. Mohammed was alike in- 
structed to preach and to fight; and the union of these opposite quali- 
ties, while it enhanced his merit, contributed to his success: the opera- 
tion of force and persuasion, of enthusiasm and fear, continually acted 
on each other, till every barrier yielded to their irresistible power. His 
voice invited the Arabs to freedom and victory, to arms and rapine, 
to the indulgence of their darling passions in this world and the other: 
the restraints which he imposed were requisite to establish the credit of 
the prophet, and to exercise the obedience of the people; and the only 
objection to his success was his rational creed of the unity and per- 
fections of God. It is not the propagation, but the permanency of his 
religion, that deserves our wonder: the same pure and perfect impres- 
sion which he engraved at Mecca and Medina is preserved, after the 
revolutions of twelve centuries, by the Indian, the African, and the 
Turkish proselytes of the Koran. If the Christian apostles, St. Peter 
or St. Paul, could return to the Vatican, they might possibly inquire the 
name of the Deity who is worshipped with such mysterious rites in that 
magnificent temple: at Oxford or Geneva they would experience less 
surprise; but it might still be incumbent on them to peruse the cate- 
chism of the church, and to study the orthodox commentators on their 
own writings and the words of their Master. But the Turkish dome 
of St. Sophia, with an increase of splendour and size, represents the 
humble tabernade erected at Medina by the hands of Mohammed. The 
Mohammedans have uniformly withstood the temptation of reducing 
the object of their faith and devotion to a level with the senses and 
imagination of man. " I believe in one God, and Mohammed the apostle 
of God," is the simple and invariable profession of Islam. The intellec- 
tual image of the Deity has never been degraded by any visible idol; 
the honours of the prophet have never transgressed the measure oi 
human virtue; and his living precepts have restrained the gratitude 
of his disciples within the bounds of reason and religion. The votaries

described by Demetrius Cantemir (Hist, of the Othman Empire, p. 94) and

mented that the Danish traveller was unable to purchase the chronicles of

of AK have, indeed, consecrated the memory of their hero, his wife, 
and his children; and some of the Persian doctors pretend that the 
divine essence was incarnate in the person of the Imams; but their 
superstition is universally condemned by the Sonnites; and their impiety 
has afforded a seasonable warning against the worship of saints and 
martyrs. The metaphysical questions on the attributes of God, and the 
liberty of man, have been agitated in the schools of the Mohammedans 
as well as in those of the Christians; but among the former they have 
never engaged the passions of the people, or disturbed the tranquillity 
of the state. The cause of this important difference may be found in the 
separation or union of the regal and sacerdotal characters.. It was the 
interest of the caliphs, the successors of the prophet and commanders 
of the faithful, to repress. and discourage all religious innovations: the 
order, the discipline, the temporal and spiritual ambition of the clergy, 
are unknown to the Moslems; and the sages of the law are the guides 
of their conscience and the oracles of their faith. From the Atlantic to 
the Ganges the Koran is acknowledged as the fundamental code, not 
only of theology but of civil and criminal jurisprudence; and the laws 
which regulate the actions and the property of mankind are guarded 
by the infallible and immutable sanction of the will of God, This re- 
ligious servitude is attended with some practical disadvantage ; the illiter- 
ate legislator has been often misled by his own prejudices and those of 
his country; and the institutions of the Arabian desert may be ill adapted 
to the wealth and numbers of Ispahan and Constantinople. On these 
occasions the Cadhi respectfully places on his' head the holy volume, 
and substitutes a dexterous interpretation more apposite to the principles 
of equity and the manners and policy of the times. 

His beneficial or pernicious influence on the public happiness is the 
last consideration in the character of Mohammed. The most bitter or 
most bigoted of his Christian or Jewish foes will surely allow that he 
assumed a false commission to inculcate a salutary doctrine, less perfect 
only than their own. He piously supposed, as the basis of his religion, 
the truth and sanctity of their prior revelations, the virtues and miracles 
of their founders. The idols of Arabia were broken before the throne 
of God; the blood of human victims was expiated by prayer, and 
fasting, and alms, the laudable or innocent arts of devotion; and his 
rewards and punishments of a future life were painted by the images 
most congenial to an ignorant and carnal generation. Mohammed was, 
perhaps, incapable of dictating a moral and political system for the 
use of his countrymen: but he breathed among the faithful a spirit of 
charity and friendship; recommended the practice of the social virtues; 
and checked, by his laws and precepts, the thirst of revenge, and the 
oppression of widows and orphans. The hostile tribes were united in 
faith and obedience,, and the valour which had been idly spent in 
domestic quarrels was vigorously directed, against a foreign enemy. 
Had the impulse been less powerful Arabia, free at home, and formid-

able abroad, might have flourished under a succession of her native 
monarchs. Her sovereignty was lost by the extent and rapidity of con- 
quest. The colonies of the nation were scattered over the East and 
West, and their blood was mingled with the blood of their converts and 
captives. After the reign of three caliphs, the throne was transported 
from Medina to the valley of Damascus and the banks of the Tigris; 
the holy cities were violated by impious war; Arabia was ruled by the 
rod of a subject, perhaps of a stranger; and the Bedoweens of the 
desert, awakening from their dream of dominion, resumed their old and 
solitary independence. 202

The Conquest of Persia, Syria, Egypt, Africa, and Spain, by the Arabs or 
Saracens Empire of the Caliphs* or Successors of Mohammedr-State of 
the Christians, etc., under their Government 

THE revolution of Arabia had not changed the character of the Arabs: 
the death of Mohammed was the signal of independence; and the hasty 
structure of his power and religion tottered to its foundations. A small 
and faithful band of his primitive disciples had listened to his eloquence, 
.and shared his distress; had fled with the apostle from the persecution 
of Mecca, or had received the fugitive in the walls of Medina. The 
increasing myriads who acknowledged Mohammed as their king and 
prophet had been compelled by his arms, or allured by his prosperity. 
The polytheists were confounded by the simple idea of a solitary and 
invisible God; the pride of the Christians and Jews disdained the yoke 
of a mortal and contemporary legislator. Their habits of faith and 
obedience were not sufficiently confirmed; and many of the new con- 
verts regretted the venerable antiquity of the law of Moses; or the rites 
.and mysteries of the Catholic church; or the idols, the sacrifices, the 
joyous festivals of their Pagan ancestors. The jarring interests and 
hereditary feuds of the Arabian tribes had not yet coalesced in a system 
of union and subordination; and the barbarians were impatient of the 
mildest and most salutary laws that curbed their passions or violated 
their customs. They submitted with reluctance to the religious precepts 
of the Koran, the abstinence from wine, the fast of the Ramadan, and 
the daily repetition of five prayers; and the alms and tithes which were

collected for the treasury of Medina could be distinguished only by a 
name from the payment of a perpetual and ignominious tribute. The 
example of Mohammed had excited a spirit of fanaticism or imposture, 
and several of his rivals presumed to imitate the conduct, and defy the 
authority, of the living prophet. At the head of the fugitives and 
auxiliaries, the first caliph was reduced to the cities of Mecca, Medina, 
and Tayef ; and perhaps the Koreish would have restored the idols of 
the Caaba, if their levity had not been checked by a seasonable reproof. 
" Ye men of Mecca, will ye be the last to embrace, and the first to 
abandon, the religion of Islam? " After exhorting the Moslems to con- 
fide in the aid of God and his apostle, Abubeker resolved, by a vigorous 
attack, to prevent the junction of the rebels. The women and children 
were safely lodged in the cavities of the mountains: the warriors, march- 
ing under eleven banners, diffused the terror of their arms; and the 
appearance of a military force revived and confirmed the loyalty of the 
faithful. The inconstant tribes accepted, with humble repentance, the 
duties of prayer, and fasting, and alms; and, after some examples of 
success and severity, the most daring apostates fell prostrate before the 
sword of the Lord and of Caled. In the fertile province of Yemanah, 1 
between the Red Sea and the Gulf of Persia, in a city not inferior to 
Medina itself, a powerful chief, his name was Moseilama, had assumed 
the character of a prophet, and the tribe of Hanifa listened to his voice. 
A female prophetess was attracted by his reputation: the decencies of 
words and actions were spurned by these favourites of heaven; 2 and 
they employed several days in mystic and amorous converse. An ob- 
scure sentence of his Koran, or book, is yet extant; 3 and, in the pride of 
his ihission, Moseilama condescended to offer a partition of the earth. 
The proposal was answered by Mohammed with contempt; but the 
rapid progress of the impostor awakened the fears of his successor: 
forty thousand Moslems were assembled under the standard of Caled; 

1 See the description of the city and country of Al Yamanah, in Abulfeda,. 
Descript Arabiae, p. 60, 61. In the thirteenth century there were some ruins 
and a few palms ; but in the present century the same ground is occupied by 
the visions and arms of a modem prophet, whose tenets are imperfectly known 
(Niebuhr, Description de 1' Arabic, p. 2915-302). 

3 Their first salutation may be transcribed, but cannot be translated. It 
was thus that Moseilama said or sung: 

Surge tandem itaque strenue permolenda; nam stratus tibi thorus est 

Aut in propatulo tentorio si velis, aut in abditiore cubiculo si malis ; 

Aut supinam te humi exporrectam fustigabo, si velis, aut si malis manibus 
pedibusque nixam. 

Aut si velis ejus (Priapi) gemino triente, aut si malis totus veniam. 

Imo, totus venito, O Apostole Dei, clamabat fcemina. Id ipsum, dicebat 

Moseilama, mihi quoque suggessit Deus.

THE ROMAN EMPIRE i 33 

and the existence of their faith was resigned to the event of a decisive 
battle. In the first action they were repulsed with the loss of twelve 
hundred men; but the skill and perseverance of their general prevailed: 
their defeat was avenged by the slaughter of ten thousand infidels; and 
Moseilama himself was pierced by an ^Ethiopian slave with the same 
javelin which had mortally wounded the uncle of Mohammed. 4 The 
various rebels of Arabia, without a chief or a cause, were speedily sup- 
pressed by the power and discipline of the rising monarchy; and the 
whole nation again professed, and more steadfastly held, the religion of 
the Koran. The ambition of the caliphs provided an immediate exer- 
cise for the restless spirit of the Saracens: their valour was united in the 
prosecution of a holy war; and their enthusiasm was equally confirmed 
by opposition and victory. 

From the rapid conquests of the Saracens a presumption will nat- 
urally arise, that the first caliphs commanded in person the armies of 
the faithful, and sought the crown of martyrdom in the foremost ranks 
of the battle. The courage of Abubeker, 6 Omar, and Othman 7 had 
indeed been tried in the persecution and wars of the prophet: and the 
personal assurance of paradise must have taught them to despise the 
pleasures and dangers of the present world. But they ascended the 
throne hi a venerable or mature age; and esteemed the domestic cares 
of religion and justice the most important duties of a sovereign. Except 
the presence of Omar at the siege of Jerusalem, their longest expeditions 
were the frequent pilgrimage from Medina to Mecca; and they calmly 
received the tidings of victory as they prayed or preached before the 
sepulchre of the prophet. The austere and frugal measure of their lives 
was the effect of virtue or habit, and the pride of their simplicity in- 
sulted the vain magnificence of the kings of the earth. When Abubeker 
assumed the office of caliph, he enjoined his daughter Ayesha to take a 
strict account of his private patrimony, that it might be evident whether 
he were enriched or impoverished by the service of the state. He 
thought himself entitled to a stipend of three pieces of gold, with the 
sufficient maintenance of a single camel and a black slave; but on the 
Priday of each week he distributed the residue of his own and the public 
money, first to the most worthy, and then to the most indigent, of the 
Moslems. The remains of his wealth, a coarse garment and five pieces 
of gold, were delivered to his successor, who lamented with a modest 
sigh his own inability to equal such an admirable model. Yet the ab-

stinence and humility of Omar were not inferior to the virtues of Abu- 
beker; his food consisted of barley-bread or dates ; his drink was water; 
he preached in a gown that was torn or tattered in twelve places; and 
a Persian satrap, who paid his homage to the conqueror, found him 
asleep among the beggars on the steps of the mosch of Medina. Econ- 
omy is the source of liberality, and the increase of the revenue enabled 
Omar to establish a just and perpetual reward for the past and pres- 
ent services of the faithful. Careless of his own emolument, he assigned 
to Abbas, the uncle of the prophet, the first and most ample allowance 
of twenty-five thousand drachms or pieces of silver. Five thousand 
were allotted to each of the aged warriors, the relics of the field of 
Beder; and the last and meanest of the companions of Mohammed was 
distinguished by the annual reward of three thousand pieces. One thou- 
sand was the stipend of the veterans who had fought in the first battles 
against the Greeks and Persians; and the decreasing pay, as low as fifty 
pieces of silver, was adapted to the respective merit and seniority of the 
soldiers of Omar. Under his reign, and that of his predecessor, the con- 
querors of the East were the trusty servants of God and the people; the 
mass of the public treasure was consecrated to the expenses of peace 
and war; a prudent mixture of justice and bounty maintained the dis- 
cipline of the Saracens, and they united, by a rare felicity, the despatch 
and execution of despotism with the equal and frugal maxims of a 
republican government. The heroic courage of Ali, 8 the consummate 
prudence of Moawiyah, excited the emulation of their subjects; and. 
the talents which had been, exercised in the school of civil discord were 
more usefully applied to propagate the faith and dominion of the 
prophet. In the sloth and vanity of the palace of Damascus the suc- 
ceeding princes of the house of Ommiyah were .alike destitute of the 
qualifications of statesmen and of saints. 10 Yet the spoils of unknown 
nations were continually laid at the foot of their throne, and the uniform 
ascent of the Arabian greatness must be ascribed to the spirit of the 
nation rather than the abilities of their chiefs. A large deduction must 
be allowed for the weakness of their enemies. The birth of Mohammed, 
was fortunately placed in the most degenerate and disorderly period of 
the Persians, the Romans, and the barbarians of Europe: the empires; 
of Trajan, or even of Constantine or Charlemagne, would have repelled' 
the assault of the naked Saracens, and the torrent of fanaticism might 
have been obscurely lost in the sands of Arabia. 

In the victorious days of the Roman republic it had been the aim of. 
the senate to confine their councils and legions to a single war, and com- 
pletely to suppress a first enemy before they provoked the hostilities of

a second. These timid maxims of policy were disdained by the mag- 
nanimity or enthusiasm of the Arabian caliphs. With the same vigour 
and success they invaded the successors of Augustus and those of 
Artaxerxes; and the rival monarchies at the same instant became the 
prey of an enemy whom they had been so long ac(?ustomed to despise. 
In the ten years of the administration of Omar, the Saracens reduced to 
his obedience thirty-six thousand cities or castles, destroyed four thou- 
sand churches or temples of the unbelievers, and edified fourteen hun- 
dred moschs for the exercise of the religion of Mohammed. One hun- 
dred years after his flight from Mecca the arms and the reign of his 
successors extended from India to the Atlantic Ocean, over the various 
and distant provinces which may be comprised under the names of, 
I. Persia; II. Syria; III. Egypt; IV. Africa; and V. Spain. Under this 
general division I shall proceed to unfold these memorable transactions, 
despatching with brevity the remote and less interesting conquests of 
the East, and reserving a fuller narrative for those domestic countries 
which had been included within the pale of the Roman empire. Yet 
I must excuse my own defects by a just complaint of the blindness and 
insufficiency of my guides. The Greeks, so loquacious in controversy, 
have not been anxious to celebrate the triumphs of their enemies. 11 
After a century of ignorance the first annals of the Musulmans were 
collected in a great measure from the voice of tradition. 12 Among the 
numerous productions of Arabic and Persian literature, 18 our inter- 

11 For the seventh and eighth century, we have scarcely any original evk 
dence of the Byzantine historians, except the chronicles of Theophanes (Thep- 
phanis Confessoris Chronographia, Gr. et Lat cum notis Jacobi Goar. Paris, 
1655, in folio), and the Abridgment of Nicephorus (Nicephori Patriarchse 
C. P. Breviarium Historicum, Gr. et Lat Paris, 1648, in folio), who both lived 
in the beginning of the ninth century (see Hanckius de Scriptor. Byzant. 
p. 200-246). Their contemporary, Photius, does not seem to be more -opulent

extreme brevity (Phot. Biblioth. Cod. Ixvi. p. 100 [p. 33, cd. Bekk.]). Some 
additions may be gleaned from the more recent histories of Cedrenus and 
Zonaras of the twelfth century. 

u Tabari, or Al Tabari, a native of Taborestan, a famous Imam of Bagdad, 
and the Livy of the Arabians, finished his general history in the year of the 
Hegira 302 (A.D. 914). At the request of his friends he reduced a^work of 
30,000 sheets to a more reasonable size. But his Arabic original is known 
only by the Persian and Turkish versions. The Saracenic history of Ebn 
Amid, or Elmacin, is said to be an abridgment of the great Tabari (Oddey's 
Hist, of the Saracens, vol. ii. preface, p. xxxix.; and, list of authors, D'Herbe- 
lot, p. 866, 870, 1014).

de Gengiscan, p. 525-550), we find in the Bibliotheque Orientale Tarikh, f a 
catalogue of two or three hundred histories or chronicles of the East, of which 
not more than three or four are older than Tabari. A lively sketch of Oriental 
literature is given by Reiske (in his Prodidagmata ad Hagji Chalifae librunr 
memorialem ad calcem Abulfedae Tabulae Syria, Lipsiae, 1766) ; but his project

prcters have selected the imperfect sketches of a more recent age. 14 The 
art and genius of history have ever been unknown to the Asiatics; 18 
they are ignorant of the laws of criticism; and our monkish chronicles 
of the same period may be compared to their most popular works, which 
are never vivified fcy the spirit of philosophy and freedom. The 
Oriental library of a Frenchman 16 would instruct the most learned 
mufti of the East; and perhaps the Arabs might not find in a single 
historian so dear and comprehensive a narrative of their own exploits 
as that which will be deduced in the ensuing sheets. 

I. In the first year of the first caliph, his lieutenant Chaled, the 
Sword of God, and the scourge ot the infidels, advanced to the banks 
of the Euphrates, and reduced the cities of Anbar and Hira. West- 
ward of the ruins of Babylon, a tribe of sedentary Arabs had fixed 
themselves on the verge of the desert; and Hira was the seat of a race 
of kings who had embraced the Christian religion, and reigned above 
six hundred years under the shadow of the throne of Persia. 17 The 
last of the Mondars was defeated and slain by Chaled; his son was 
sent a captive to Medina; his nobles bowed before the successor of the

The four following titles represent the Annals which have guided me in this 
general narrative : i. Annales Eutychii, Patriarchs Alexandrini, ab Edwardo 
Pocockio, Oxon. 1656, 2 vols. in 4to. A pompous edition of an indifferent 
author, translated by Pocock to gratify the presbyterian prejudices of his 
friend Selden._ 2. Historia Saracenica Georgii Elmacini, opera et studio

the character of the respectable author consult his friend Thevenot (Voy- 
ages du Levant, part i. chap. i). His work is an agreeable miscellany which 
must gratify every taste; but I never can digest the alphabetical order; and 
I find him more satisfactory in the Persian than the Arabic history. The 
recent supplement from the papers of MM. Visdelou and Galland (in folio, 
La Haye, 1779) is of a different cast, a medley of tales, proverbs, and Chinese 
antiquities. 

"Pocock will explain the chronology (Specimen Hist. Arabum, p. 66-74), 
and D'Anville the geography (1'Euphrate et le Tigre, p. 125), of the dynasty 
of the Almondars. The English scholar understood more Arabic than the 
mufti of Aleppo (Ockley, vol. ii. p. 34) ; the French geographer is equally 
at home in every age and every climate of the world.

prophet; the people was tempted by the example and success of their 
countrymen; and the caliph accepted as the first-fruits of foreign 
conquest an annual tribute of seventy thousand pieces of gold. The 
conquerors, and even their historians, were astonished by the dawn 
of their future greatness: " In the same year," says Elmacin, " Chaled 
fought many signal battles: an immense multitude of the infidels was 
slaughtered, and spoils infinite and innumerable were acquired by the 
victorious Moslems." 18 But the invincible Chaled was soon transferred 
to the Syrian war: the invasion of the Persian frontier was conducted 
by less active or less prudent commanders: the Saracens were repulsed 
with loss in the passage of the Euphrates; and, though they chastised 
the insolent pursuit of the Magians, their remaining forces still hovered 
in the desert of Babylon. 

The indignation and fears of the Persians suspended for a moment 
their intestine divisions. By the unanimous sentence of the priests 
and nobles, their queen Arzema was deposed; the sixth of the transient 
usurpers who had risen and vanished in three or four years since the 
death of Chosroes and the retreat of Heradius. Her tiara was placed 
on the head of Yezdegerd, the grandson of Chosroes; and the same era, 
which coincides with an astronomical period, 19 has recorded the fall 
of the Sassanian dynasty and the religion of Zoroaster. 20 The youth 
and inexperience of the prince he was only fifteen years of age 
declined a perilous encounter; the royal standard was delivered into 
the hands of his general Rustam; and a remnant of thirty thousand 
regular troops was swelled in truth, or in opinion, to one hundred and 
twenty thousand subjects, or allies, of the Great King. The Moslems, 
whose numbers were reinforced from twelve to thirty thousand, had 
pitched their camp in the plains of Cadesia: 21 and their line, though

compendious term of infidels, and^ I often adopt (I hope without scandal) 
this characteristic mode of expression. 

M A cycle of 120 years, at the end of which an intercalary month of 30 days 
supplied the use of our Bissextile, and restored the integrity of the solar year. 
In a great revolution of 1440 years this intercalation was successively removed 
from the first to the twelfth month; but Hyde and Freret are involved in a 
profound controversy, whether the twelve, or only eight of these changes were 
accomplished before the era of Yezdegerd, which is unanimously fixed to the 
i6th of June, A.D. 632. How laboriously does the curious spirit of Europe 
explore the darkest and most distant antiquities (Hyde, de Religione Persarum.

the arms of the caliph Omar ; and these unquestionable dates overthrow the

it consisted of fewer men, could produce more soldiers, than the un- 
wieldy host of the infidels. I shall here observe what I must often 
repeat, that the charge of the Arabs was not, like that of the Greeks 
and Romans, the effort of a firm and compact infantry: their military 
force was chiefly formed of cavalry and archers; and the engagement, 
which was often interrupted and often renewed by single combats and 
flying skirmishes, might be protracted without any decisive event to 
the continuance of several days. The periods of the battle of Cadesia 
were distinguished by their peculiar appellations. The first, from the 
well-timed appearance of six thousand of the Syrian brethren, was 
denominated the day of succour. The day of concussion might express 
the disorder of one, or perhaps of both, of the contending armies. The 
third, a nocturnal tumult, received the whimsical name of the night 
of barking, from the discordant clamours, which were compared to the 
inarticulate sounds of the fiercest animals. The morning of the suc- 
ceeding day determined the fate of Persia; and a seasonable whirlwind 
drove a doud of dust against the faces of the unbelievers. The clangour 
of arms was re-echoed to the tent of Rustam, who, far unlike the 
ancient hero of his name, was gently reclining in a cool -and tranquil 
shade, amidst the baggage of his camp, and the train of mules that were 
laden with gold and silver. On the sound of danger he .started from 
his couch; but his flight was overtaken by a valiant Arab, who caught 
him by the foot, struck off his head, hoisted it on a lance, and, instantly 
returning to the field of battle, carried slaughter and dismay among 
the thickest ranks of the Persians. The Saracens confess a loss of seven 
thousand five hundred men; and the battle of Cadesia is justly described 
by the epithets of obstinate and atrocious. 22 The standard of the 
monarchy was overthrown and captured in the field a leathern apron 
of a blacksmith who in ancient times had arisen the deliverer of Persia; 
but this badge of heroic poverty was disguised and almost concealed 
by a profusion of precious gems. 28 After this victory the wealthy 
province of Irak, or Assyria, submitted to the caliph, and his conquests 
were firmly established by the speedy foundation of Bassora, 24 a place 

p. 163) reckons 15 leagues, and observes that the place is supplied with dates 
and water. 

[The battle of Cadesia was one of the decisive battles of the world. Layard, 
in his Nineveh and Babylon, says, " The ruins of Cadesia may be seen on both 
sides of the Tigris. Sailing down the Tigris the traveller perceives huge 
masses of brickwork jutting out from the falling banks, or overhanging the 
precipice of earth that hems in the stream. .Here and there are more perfect 
ruins of buildings, walls of solid masonry of the Sassanian period, and 
cupolas fretted with the elegant tracery of early Arabic architecture. These 
are the remains of the palaces and castles of the last Persian kings and of the 
first caliphs." 0. S.]

which ever commands the trade and navigation of the Persians. At the 
distance of fourscore miles from the Gulf the Euphrates and Tigris 
unite in a broad and direct current, which is aptly styled the river of 
the Arabs. In the midway, between the junction and the mouth of these 
famous streams, the new settlement was planted on the western bank: 
the first colony was composed of eight hundred Moslems; but the in- 
fluence of the situation soon reared a flourishing and populous capital. 
The air, though excessively hot, is pure and healthy; the meadows are 
filled with palm-trees and cattle; and one of the adjacent valleys has 
been celebrated among the four paradises or gardens of Asia. Under 
the first caliphs the jurisdiction of this Arabian colony extended over 
the southern provinces of Persia: the city has been sanctified by the 
tombs of the companions and martyrs; and the vessels of Europe still 
frequent the port of Bassora, as a convenient station and passage of the 
Indian trade. 

After the defeat of Cadesia, a country intersected by rivers and canals 
might have opposed an insuperable barrier to the victorious cavalry; 
and the walls of Ctesiphon or Madayn, which had resisted the battering- 
rams of the Romans, would not have yielded to the darts of the Saracens. 
But the flying Persians were overcome by the belief that the last day 
of their religion and empire was at hand; the strongest posts were 
abandoned by treachery or cowardice; and the king, with a part of his 
family and treasures, escaped to Holwan, at the foot of the Median 
hills. In the third month after the battle, Said, the lieutenant of Omar, 
passed the Tigris without opposition; the capital was taken by assault; 
and the disorderly resistance of the people gave a keener edge to the 
sabres of the Moslems, who shouted with religious transport, " This is 
the white palace of Chosroes; this is the promise of the apostle of God! " 
The naked robbers of the desert were suddenly enriched beyond the 
measure of their hope or knowledge. Each chamber revealed a new 
treasure secreted with art, or ostentatiously displayed; the gold and 
silver, the various wardrobes and precious furniture, surpassed (says 
Abulfeda) the estimate of fancy or numbers; and another historian 
defines the untold and almost infinite mass by the fabulous computa- 
tion of three thousands of thousands of thousands of pieces of gvfldJ* 
Some minute though curious facts represent the contrast of riches and 
ignorance. From the remote islands of the. Indian Ocean a large

mixture of wax to illuminate the palaces of the East. Strangers to the 
name and properties of that odoriferous gum, the Saracens, mistaking it 
for salt, mingled the camphire in their bread, and were astonished at 
the bitterness of the taste. One of the apartments of the palace was 
decorated with a carpet of silk, sixty cubits in length, and as many in 
breadth: a paradise or garden was depictured on the ground; the flowers, 
fruits, and shrubs were imitated by the figures of the gold embroidery, 
and the colours of the precious stones; and the ample square was en- 
circled by a variegated and verdant border. The Arabian general 
persuaded his soldiers to relinquish their claim, in the reasonable hope 
that the eyes of the caliph would be delighted with the splendid work- 
manship of nature and industry. Regardless of the merit of art and the 
pomp of royalty, the rigid Omar divided the prize among his brethren 
of Medina: the picture was destroyed; but such was the intrinsic value 
of the materials, that the share of Ali alone was sold for twenty thou- 
sand drams. A mule that carried away the tiara and cuirass, the belt 
and bracelets of Chosroes, was overtaken by the pursuers; the gorgeous 
trophy was presented to the commander of the faithful; and the gravest 
of the companions condescended to smile when they beheld the white 
beard, hairy arms, and uncouth figure of the veteran who was invested 
with the spoils of the Great King. 27 The sack of Ctesiphon was followed 
by its desertion and gradual decay. The Saracens disliked the air and 
situation of the place, and Omar was advised by his general to remove 
the seat of government to the Western side of the Euphrates. In every 
age the foundation and ruin of the Assyrian cities has been easy and 
rapid: the country is destitute of stone and timber; and the most solid 
structures zs are composed of bricks baked in the sun, and joined by a 
cement of a native bitumen. The name of Cufa 20 describes an habitation 
of reeds and earth; but the importance of the new capital was supported 
by the numbers, wealth, and spirit of a colony of veterans; and their 
licentiousness was indulged by the wisest caliphs, who were apprehen- 
sive of provoking the revolt of a hundred thousand swords: " Ye men of 
Cufa," said Ali, who solicited their aid, " you have been always conspicu- 
ous by your valour. You conquered the Persian king and scattered his 
forces, till you had taken possession of his inheritance." This mighty 
conquest was achieved by the battles of Jalula and Nehavend. After 
the loss of the former, Yezdegerd fled from Holwan, and concealed his 
shame and despair in the mountains of Farsistan, from whence Cyrus 
had descended with his equal and valiant companions. The courage 

These may be the islands of the first climate from whence the Arabians im-

of the nation survived that of the monarch: among the hills to the south 
of Ecbatana or Hamadan one hundred and fifty thousand Persians 
made a third and final stand for their religion and country; and the 
decisive battle of Nehavend was styled by the Arabs the victory of 
victories. If it be true that the flying general of the Persians was 
stopped and overtaken in a crowd of mules and camels laden with 
Vmey, the incident, however slight or singular, will denote the luxurious 
Impediments of an Oriental army. 80 

The geography of Persia is darkly delineated by the Greeks and 
Latins; but the most illustrious of her cities appear to be more ancient 
than the invasion of the Arabs. By the reduction of Hamadan and 
Ispahan, of Caswin, Tauris, and Rei, they gradually approached the 
shores of the Caspian Sea: and the orators of Mecca might applaud 
the success and spirit of the faithful, who had already lost sight of the 
northern bear, and had almost transcended the bounds of the habitable 
world. 81 Again turning towards the West and the Roman empire, they 
repassed the Tigris over the bridge of Mosul, and, in the captive 
provinces of Armenia and Mesopotamia, embraced their victorious 
brethren of the Syrian army. From the palace of Madayn their Eastern 
progress was not less rapid or extensive. They advanced along the 
Tigris and the Gulf, penetrated through the passes of the mountains 
into the valley of Estachar or Persepolis, and profaned the last sanc- 
tuary of the Magian empire. The grandson of Chosroes was nearly 
surprised among the falling columns and mutilated figures a sad em- 
blem of the past and present fortune of Persia: 82 he fled with accelerated 
haste over the desert of Kirman, implored the aid of the warlike 
Segestans, and sought a humble refuge on the verge of the Turkish and 
Chinese power. But a victorious army is insensible of fatigue: the 
Arabs divided their forces in the pursuit of a timorous enemy; and 
the caliph Othman promised the government of Chorasan to the first 
general who should enter that large and populous country, the kingdom 
of the ancient Bactrians. The condition was accepted; the prize was 
deserved; the standard of Mohammed was planted on the walls of Herat, 
Merou, and Balch; and the successful leader neither halted nor reposed 
till his foaming cavalry had tasted the waters of the Oxus. In the

public anarchy the independent governors of the cities and castles ob- 
tained their separate capitulations; the terms were granted or imposed 
by the esteem, the prudence, or the compassion of the victors; and a 
simple profession of faith established the distinction between a brother 
and a slave. After a noble defence, Harmozan, the prince or satrap 
of Ahwaz and Susa, was compelled to surrender his person and his state 
to the discretion of the caliph; and their interview exhibits a portrait 
of the Arabian manners. In the presence, and by the command, of Omar 
the gay barbarian was despoiled of his silken robes embroidered .with 
gold, and of his tiara bedecked with rubies and emeralds: " Are you now 
sensible," said the conqueror to his naked captive, " are you now sensible 
of the judgment of God, and of the different rewards of infidelity 
and obedience? " " Alas! " replied Harmozan, " I feel them too deeply. 
In the days of our common ignorance we fought with the weapons of the 
flesh, and my nation was superior. God was then neuter: since he has 
espoused your quarrel, you have subverted our kingdom and religion." 
Oppressed by this painful dialogue, the Persian complained of intoler- 
able thirst, but discovered some apprehension lest he should be killed 
whilst he was drinking a cup of water. " Be of good courage," said 
the caliph; " your life is safe till you have drunk this water:" the crafty 
satrap accepted the assurance, and instantly dashed the vase against 
the ground. Omar would have avenged the deceit, but his companions 
represented the sanctity of an oath; and the speedy conversion of Harm- 
ozan entitled him not only to a free pardon, but even to a stipend of 
two thousand pieces of gold. The administration, of Persia was regulated 
by an actual survey of the people, the cattle, and the fruits of the 
earth; 83 and this monument, which attests the vigilance of the caliphs, 
might have instructed the philosophers of every age. 84 

The flight of Yezdegerd had carried him beyond the Oxus, and as 
far as the Jaxartes, two rivers 35 of ancient and modern renown, which 
descend from the mountains of India towards the Caspian Sea. He 
was hospitably entertained by Tarkhan, prince of Fargana, 30 a fertile 
province on the Jaxartes: the king of Samarcand, with the Turkish 
tribes of Sogdiana and Scythia, were moved by the lamentations and 
promises of the fallen monarch; and he solicited, by a suppliant

embassy, the more solid and powerful friendship of the emperor of 
China. 87 The virtuous Taitsong, 88 the first of the dynasty of the Tang, 
may be justly compared with the Antonines of Rome: his people en- 
joyed the blessings of prosperity and peace; and his dominion was 
aduiowledged by forty-four hordes of the barbarians of Tartary. His 
last garrisons of Cashgar and Khoten maintained a frequent inter- 
course with their neighbours of the Jaxartes and Oxus; a recent colony 
of Persians had introduced into China the astronomy of the Magi; and 
Taitsong might be alarmed by the rapid progress and dangerous 
vicinity of the Arabs. The influence, and perhaps the supplies, of 
China revived the hopes of Yezdegerd and the zeal of the worshippers 
of fire; and he returned with an army of Turks to conquer the inheri- 
tance of his fathers. The fortunate Moslems, without unsheathing their 
swords, were the spectators of his ruin and death. The grandson of 
Chosroes was betrayed by his servant, insulted by the seditious inhabi- 
tants of Merou, and oppressed, defeated, and pursued by his barbarian 
allies. He reached the banks of a river, and offered his rings and 
bracelets for an instant passage in a miller's boat. Ignorant or insen- 
sible of royal distress, the rustic replied that four drau--s of silver were 
the daily profit of his mill, and that he would not o-uspend his work 
unless the loss were repaid. In this moment of hesitation and delay the 
last of the Sassanian kings was overtaken and slaughtered by the 
Turkish cavalry, in the nineteenth year of his unhappy reign.** His 
son Firuz, a humble client of the Chinese emperor, accepted the station 
of captain of his guards; and the Magian worship was long preserved 
by a colony of loyal exiles in the province of Bucharia. His grandson 
inherited the regal name; but after a faint and fruitless enterprise he 
returned to China, and ended his days in the palace of Sigan. The 
male line of the Sassanides was extinct; but the female ^captives, the 
daughters of Persia, were given to the conquerors in servitude or mar- 
riage ; and the race of the caliphs and imams was ennobled by the blood 
of their royal mothers. 40

and D'Herbelot (p. 485). The end of Yezdegerd was not only unfortunate^ 

40 The two daughters of Yezdegerd married Hassan, the son of All, and 
Mohammed, the son of Abubeker; and the first of these was the father of 
a numerous progeny. The daughter of Phirouz became the wife of the 
caliph Walid, and their son Yezid derived his genuine or fabulous descent 
from the Chosroes of Persia, the Csesars of Rome, and the Chagans of the 
Turks or Avars (D'Herbelot, Biblioth. Orientale, p. g6, 487).

territories of the Saracens and of the Turks. This narrow boundary 
was soon overleaped by the spirit of the Arabs; the governors of 
Chorasan extended their successive inroads; and one of their triumphs 
was adorned with the buskin of a Turkish queen, which she dropped 
in her precipitate flight beyond the hills of Bochara. 41 But the final 
conquest of Transoxiana, 42 as well as of Spain, was reserved for the 
glorious reign of the inactive Walid, and the name of Catibah, the 
:amel-driver, declares the origin and merit of his successful lieutenant. 
While one of his colleagues displayed the first Mohammedan banner on 
the banks of the Indus, the spacious regions between the Oxus, the Jax- 
artes, and the Caspian Sea were reduced by the arms of Catibah to 
the obedience of the prophet and of the caliph. 43 A tribute of two mil- 
lions of pieces of gold was imposed on the infidels; their idols were 
burnt or broken; the Musulman chief pronounced a sermon in the new 
mosch of Carizme; after several battles the Turkish hordes were driven 
back to the desert; and the emperors of China solicited the friendship 
of the victorious Arabs. To their industry the prosperity of the prov- 
ince, the Sogdiana of the ancients, may in a great measure be ascribed; 
but the advantages of the soil and climate had been understood and 
cultivated since the reign of the Macedonian kings. Before the inva- 
. sion of the Saracens, Carizme, Bochara, and Samarcand were rich and 
populous under the yoke of the shepherds of the north. These cities 
#ere surrounded with a double wall; and the exterior fortification, of 
a larger circumference, enclosed the fields and gardens of the adjacent 
district. The mutual wants of India and Europe were supplied by the 
diligence of the Sogdian merchants; and the inestimable art of trans- 
forming linen into paper has been diffused from the manufacture of 
Samarcand over the Western world. 44

son of Ziyad, a name afterwards infamous by the murder of Hosein (Oakley's 
History of the Saracens, vol. ii. p. 142, 143). His brother Salem was accom- 
panied by his wife, the first Arabian woman (A.D. 680) who passed the Oxus : 
she borrowed, or rather stole, the crown and jewels of the princess of the 
Sogdians (p. 231, 232). 

*A part of Abulfeda's geography is translated by Greaves, inserted in Hud- 
son's collection of the minor geographers (torn, iii.), and entitled, Descriptio 
Chorasmiae et Mawaralnahrce, id est, regionum extra fluvium, Oxum, p. 80. 
The name of Transoxiana, softer in sound, equivalent in sense, is aptly used 
by Petit de la Croix (Hist, de Gengiscan, etc,) and some modern Orientalists, 
but they are mistaken in ascribing it to the writers of antiquity. 

48 The conquests of Catibah are faintly marked by Elmacin (Hist. Saracen, 
p. 4), D'Herbelot (Biblioth. Orient. Catbah, Samarcand Valid.), and De 
Guignes (Hist, des Huns, torn. i. p. 58, 59). '

credible testimony that paper was first imported from China to Samarcand,, 
A.H. 30, and invented, or rather introduced, at Mecca, A.H. 88. The Escurial

ment than he despatched a circular letter to the Arabian tribes. " In 
the name of the most merciful God, to the rest of the true believers. 
Health and happiness, and the mercy and blessing of God, be upon 
you. I praise the most high God, and I pray for his prophet Moham- 
med. This is to acquaint you that I intend to send the true believers 
into Syria 4B to take it out of the hands of the infidels. And I would 
have you know that the fighting for religion is an act of obedience to 
God." His messengers returned with the tidings of pious and martial 
ardour which they had kindled in every province; and the camp of 
Medina was successively filled with the intrepid bands of the Saracens, 
who panted for action, complained of the heat of the season and the 
scarcity of provisions, and accused with impatient murmurs the delays 
of the caliph. As soon as their numbers were complete, Abubeker as- 
cended the hill, reviewed the men, the horses, and the arms, and poured 
forth a fervent prayer for the success of their undertaking. In person 
and on foot he accompanied the first day's march; and when the blush- 
ing leaders attempted to dismount, the caliph removed their scruples- 
by a declaration that those who rode and those who walked in the 
service of religion were equally meritorious. His instructions 4C to the 
chiefs of the Syrian army were inspired by the warlike fanaticism which 
advances to seize and affects to despise the objects of earthly ambition. 
" Remember," said the successor of the prophet, " that you are always 
in the presence of God, on the verge of death, in the assurance of judg- 
ment, and the hope of paradise. Avoid injustice and oppression; consult 
with your brethren, and study to preserve the love and confidence of 
your troops. When you fight the battles of the Lord, acquit yourselves 
"ike men, without turning your backs; but let not your victory be 
stained with the blood of women or children. Destroy no palm-trees, 
nor burn any fields of com. Cut down no fruit-trees, nor do any mis- 
chief to cattle, only such as you kill to eat. When you make any 
covenant or article, stand to it, and be as good as your word. As you 
go on, you will find some religious persons who live retired in monas- 
teries, and propose to themselves to serve God that way: let them alone, 

45 A separate history of the conquest of Syria has been composed by Al 
Wakidi, cadi of Bagdad, who was born A.D. 748, and died A.D. 822 : he likewise 
wrote the conquest of Egypt, of Diarbekir, etc. Above the meagre and recent 
chronicles of the Arabians, Al Wakidi has the double merit of antiquity and 
copiousness. His tales and traditions afford an artless picture of the men 
and the times. Yet his narrative is too often defective, trifling, and improb- 
able. Till something better shall be found, his learned and spirited interpreter 
(Ockley, in his History of the Saracens, vol. i. p. 21-342) will not deserve 
the petulant animadversion of Reiske (Prodidagmata ad Hagji Chalifaa 
Tabulas, p. 236). I am sorry to think that the labours of Ockley were con. 
summated in a jail (see his two prefaces to the first vol. AJ&gt;. 1708, to th5 
second, 1718, with the list of authors at the en/*?.

and neither kill them nor destroy their monasteries: 47 and you will find 
another sort of people, that belong to the synagogue of Satan, who have 
shaven crowns; 48 be sure you cleave their skulls, and give them no 
quarter till they either turn Mohammedans or pay tribute." All pro- 
fane or frivolous conversation, all dangerous recollection of ancient 
quarrels, was severely prohibited among the Arabs: in the tumult of a 
camp the exercises of religion were assiduously practised; and the in- 
tervals of action were employed in prayer, meditation, and the study of 
the Koran. The abuse, or even the use, of wine was chastised by four- 
score strokes on the soles of the feet, and in the fervour of their primi- 
tive zeal many secret sinners revealed their fault and solicited their 
punishment. After some hesitation, the command of the Syrian army 
was delegated to Abu Obeidah, one of the fugitives of Mecca, and com- 
panions of Mohammed; whose zeal and devotion were assuaged, with- 
out being abated, by the singular mildness and benevolence of his 
temper. But in all the emergencies of war the soldiers demanded the su- 
perior genius of Chaled; and whoever might be the choice of the prince, 
the Sword of God was both in fact and fame the foremost leader of the 
Saracens. He obeyed without reluctance; he was consulted without 
jealousy; and such was the spirit of the man, or rather of the times, 
that Chaled professed his readiness to serve under the banner of the 
faith, though it were in the hands of a child or an enemy. Glory and 
riches and dominion were indeed promised to the victorious Musulman; 
but he was carefully instructed, that, if the goods of this life were his 
only incitement, they likewise would be his only reward. 

One of the fifteen provinces of Syria, the cultivated lands to the 
eastward of the Jordan, had been decorated by Roman vanity with the 
name of Arabia; 49 and the first arms of the Saracens were justified by 
the semblance of a national right. The country was enriched by the 
various benefits of trade; by the vigilance of the emperors it was cov- 
ered with a line of forts; and the populous cities of Gerasa, Philadel- 
phia, a*d Bosra 50 were secure, at least from a surprise, by the solid 

47 Notwithstanding this precept, M. Pauw (Recherches sur les Egyptiens, 
torn. ii. p. 192, edit. Lausanne) represents the Bedoweens as the implacable 
enemies of the Christian monks. For my own part, I am more inclined to 
suspect the avarice of the Arabian robbers and the prejudices of the German 
philosopher. 

48 Even in the seventh century the monks were generally laymen : they wore 
their hair long and dishevelled, and shaved their heads when they were or- 
dained priests. The circular tonsure was sacred and mysterious: it was the 
crown of thorns ; but it was likewise a royal diadem, and every or Jest was a

structure of their walls. The last of these cities was the eighteenth 
station from Medina: the road was familiar to the caravans of Hejaz 
and Irak, who annually visited this plenteous market of the province 
and the desert: the perpetual jealousy of the Arabs had trained the in- 
habitants to arms; and twelve thousand horse could sally from the gates 
of Bosra, an appellation which signifies, in the Syriac language, a strong 
tower of defence. Encouraged by their first success against the open 
towns and flying parties of the borders, a detachment of four thousand 
Moslems presumed to summon and attack the fortress of Bosra. They 
were oppressed by the numbers of the Syrians; they were saved by tlie 
presence of Chaled, with fifteen hundred horse: he blamed the enter- 
prise,, restored the battle^ and rescued his friend, the venerable Serjabil, 
who had vainly invoked the unity of God and the promises of the 
apostle. After a short repose the Moslems performed their ablutions 
with sand instead of water; 51 and the morning prayer was. recited by 
Chaled before they mounted on horseback. Confident in their strength^ 
the people of Bosra threw open their gates, drew Iheir forces into the 
plain, and swore to die in the defence of their religion. But a religion 
of peace was incapable of withstanding the fanatic cry of " Fight, fight! 
Paradise, paradise! " that re-echoed in the ranks of the Saracens; and 
the uproar of the town, the ringing of bells** 2 and the exclamations of 
the priests and monks, increased the dismay and disorder of the Christs 
ians. With the loss of two hundred and thirty men, the Arabs remained 
masters of the field; and the ramparts of Bosra, in expectation of human 
or divine aid, were crowded with holy crosses and consecrated banners. 
The governor Romanus had recommended an early submission: despised 
by the people, and degraded from his office, He still retained the desire 
and opportunity of revenge. In a nocturnal interview be informed the 
enemy of a subterraneous passage from his house under the wall of the 
city; the son of the caliph, with a hundred volunteers, were committed 
to the faith of this, new ally, and their successful intrepidity gave an 
easy entrance to their companions. After Chaled had imposed the 
terms of servitude and tribute, the apostate or convert avowed in the 
assembly of the people his meritorious treason: "I renounce your

And I deny him that was crucified, and whosoever worships him. 
And I choose God for my Lord, Islam for my faith, Mecca for my

in spite of those who join partners with God." 

The conquest of Bosra, four days' journey from Damascus, 58 encour- 
aged the Arabs to besiege the ancient capital of Syria. 54 At some dis- 
tance from the walls they encamped among the groves and fountains of 
that delicious territory, 55 and the usual option, of the Mohammedan 
faith, of tribute, or of war, was proposed to the resolute citizens, who 
had been lately strengthened by a reinforcement of five thousand 
Greeks. In the decline, as in the infancy of the military art, a hostile 
defiance was frequently offered and accepted by the generals them- 
selves: 56 many a lance was shivered in the plain of Damascus, and the 
personal prowess of Chaled was signalised in the first sally of the be- 
sieged. After an obstinate combat he had overthrown and made pris- 
oner one of the Christian leaders, a stout and worthy antagonist. He 
instantly mounted a fresh horse, the gift of the governor of Palmyra, 
and pushed forwards to the front of the battle. " Repose yourself for 
a moment," said his friend Derar, "and permit me to supply your 
place: you are fatigued with fighting with this dog." "0 Derar," 
replied the indefatigable Saracen, " we shall rest in the world to come. 
He that labours to-day shall rest to-morrow." With the same unabated 
ardour Chaled answered, encountered, and vanquished a second cham- 
pion; and the heads of his two captives, who refused to abandon their 
religion, were indignantly hurled into the midst of the city. The event 
of some general and partial actions reduced the Damascenes to a closer

defence: but a messenger, whom they dropped from the walls, returned 
with the promise of speedy and powerful succour, and their tumultuous 
joy conveyed the intelligence to the camp of the Arabs. After some 
debate, it was resolved by the generals to raise, or rather to suspend, 
the siege of Damascus till they had given battle to the forces of the 
emperor. In the retreat Chaled would have chosen the more perilous 
station of the rear-guard; he modestly yielded to the wishes of Abu 
Obeidah. But in (he hour of danger he flew to the rescue of his com- 
panion, who was rudely pressed by a sally of six thousand horse and 
ten thousand foot, and few among the Christians could relate at Damas- 
cus the circumstances of their defeat. The importance of the contest 
required the junction of the Saracens, who were dispersed on the fron- 
tiers of Syria and Palestine; and I shall transcribe one of the circular 
mandates which was addressed to Amrou, the future conqueror of 
Egypt: " In the name of the most merciful God: from Chaled to 
Amrou, health and happiness. Know that thy brethren the Moslems 
design to march to Aiznadin, where there is an army of seventy thou- 
sand Greeks, who purpose to come against us, that they may extinguish 
the light of God with their mouths; but God preseroeth his light in spite 
of the infidels. As soon therefore as this letter of mine shall be deliv- 
ered to thy hands, come with those that are with thee to Aiznadin, 
where thou shalt find us if it please the most high God." The summons 
was cheerfully obeyed, and the forty-five thousand Moslems, who met 
on the same day, on the same spot, ascribed to the blessing of Provi- 
dence the effects of their activity and zeal. 

About four years after the triumphs of the Persian war the repose 
of Heraclius and the empire was again disturbed by a new enemy, the 
power of whose religion was more strongly felt than it was clearly under- 
stood by the Christians of the East. In his palace of Constantinople 
or Antioch he was awakened by the invasion of Syria, the loss of Bosra, 
and the danger of Damascus. An army of seventy thousand veterans, 
or new levies, was assembled at Hems or Emesa, under the command 
of his general Werdan: 58 and these troops, consisting chiefly of cavalry, 
might be indifferently styled either Syrians, or Greeks, or Romans: 
Syrians, from the place of their birth or warfare; Greeks, from the 
religion and language of their sovereign; and Romans, from the proud 
appellation which was still profaned by the successors of Constantine. 

OT These words are a text of the Koran, c. ix. 32, Ixi. 8. Like our fanatics 
of the last century, the Moslems, on every familiar or important ^ occasion, 
spoke the language of their Scriptures a style more natural in their mouths 
than the Hebrew idiom, transplanted into the climate and dialect of Britain. 

w The name of Werdan is unknown to Theophanes; and, though it might 
belong to an Armenian chief, has very little of a Greek aspect or sound. If 
the Byzantine historians have mangled the Oriental names, the Arabs, in this 
instance, likewise have taken ample revenge on their enemies. In transposing 
the Greek character from right to left, might they not produce, from the 
familiar appellation of Andrew, something like the anagram Werdant 



350 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

On the plain of Aiznadin, 59 as Werdan rode on a white mule decorated 
with gold chains, and surrounded with ensigns and standards, he was 
surprised by the near approach of a fierce and naked warrior, who had 
undertaken to view the state of the enemy. The adventurous valour 
of Derar was inspired, and has perhaps been adorned, by the enthusi- 
asm of his age and country. The hatred of the Christians, the love of 
spoil, and the contempt of danger, were the ruling passions of the auda- 
cious Saracen; and the prospect of instant death could never shake his 
religious confidence, or ruffle the calmness of his resolution, or even sus- 
pend the frank and martial pleasantry of his humour. In the most 
hopeless enterprises he was bold, and prudent, and fortunate: after in- 
numerable hazards, after being thrice a prisoner hi the hands of the 
infidels, he still survived to relate the achievements, and to enjoy the 
rewards, of the Syrian conquest. On this occasion his single lance 
maintained a flying fight against thirty Romans, who were detached 
by Werdan; and, after killing or unhorsing seventeen of their number, 
Derar returned in safety to his applauding brethren. When his rash- 
ness was mildly censured by the general, he excused himself with the 
simplicity of a soldier. " Nay," said Derar, " I did not begin first: but 
they came out to take me, and I was afraid that God should see me 
turn my back: and indeed I fought in good earnest, and without doubt 
God assisted me against them; and had I not been apprehensive of dis- 
obeying your orders, I should not have come away as I did; and I per- 
ceive already that they will fall into our hands. 17 In the presence of 
both armies a venerable Greek advanced from the ranks with a liberal 
offer of peace; and the departure of the Saracens would have been pur- 
chased by a gift to each soldier of a turban, a robe, and a piece of 
gold; ten robes and a hundred pieces to their leader; one hundred robes 
and a thousand pieces to the caliph. A smile of indignation expressed 
the refusal of Chaled. " Ye Christian dogs, you know your option; the 
Koran, the tribute, or the sword. We are a people whose delight is in 
war rather than in peace: and we despise your pitiful alms, since we 
shall be speedily masters of your wealth, your families, and your per- 
sons." Notwithstanding this apparent disdain, he was deeply conscious 
of the public danger: those who had been in Persia, and had seen the 
armies of Chosroes, confessed that they never beheld a more formid- 
able array. From the superiority of the enemy the artful Saracen de- 
rived a fresh incentive of courage: " You see before you," said he, " the 
united force of the Romans; you cannot hope to escape, but you may 
conquer Syria hi a single day. The event depends on your discipline 
and patience. Reserve yourselves till the evening. It was in the eve- 
ning that the Prophet was accustomed to vanquish." During two suc- 

* [The exact site of Aiznadin is uncertain, but the place where this great 
battle occurred probably lay between Ramla and Beit Djibrin, the ancient 
Beto-Gabra, in the south of Palestine. With regard to the name Werdan 
which Gibbon seeks to prove may be an anagram of the word u Andrew," it 
is hard to understand what was in Gibbon's mind at this time. The name 
Werdan is of Armenian origin and is akin to Bardanes. O. S.] 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE i$t 

cessive engagements, his temperate firmness sustained the darte of the 
enemy and the murmurs of his troops. At length, when the spirits and 
quivers of the adverse line were almost exhausted, Chaled gave the 
signal of onset and victory. The remains of. the Imperial army fled to 
Antidch, or Caesarea, or Damascus; and the death of four hundred and 
seventy Moslems was compensated by the opinion that they had sent 
to hell above fifty thousand of the infidels. The spoil was inestimable; 
many banners and crosses of gold and silver, precious stones, silver and 
gold chains, and innumerable suits of the richest armour and apparel. 
The general distribution was postponed till Damascus should be taken; 
but the seasonable supply of arms became the instrument of new vic- 
tories. The glorious intelligence was transmitted to the throne of the 
caliph; and the Arabian tribes, the coldest or most hostile to the 
prophet's mission^ were eager and importunate to share the harvest of 
Syria, 

The sad tidings were carried to Damascus by the speed of grief and 
terror; and the inhabitants beheld from their walls the return of the 
heroes of Aiznadin. Amrou led the van at the head of nine thousand 
horse: the bands of the Saracens succeeded each other in formidable 
review; and the rear was closed by Chaled in person, with the standard 
of the black eagle. To the activity of Derar he intrusted the commis- 
sion of patrolling round the city with two thousand horse, of scouring 
the plain, and of intercepting all succour or intelligence. The rest of 
the Arabian chiefs were fixed in their respective stations before the 
seven gates of Damascus; and the siege was renewed with fresh vigour 
and confidence. The art, the labour, the military engines of the Greeks 
and Romans are seldom to be found in the simple, though successful, 
operations of the Saracens: it was sufficient for them to invest a city 
with arms rather than with trenches; to repel the sallies of the besieged; 
to attempt a stratagem or an assault; or to expect the progress of 
famine and discontent. Damascus would have acquiesced in the trial 
of Aiznadin, as a final and peremptory sentence between the emperor 
and the caliph: her courage was rekindled by the example and authority 
of Thomas, a noble Greek, illustrious in a private condition by the 
alliance of Heradius. 60 The tumult and illumination of the night pro- 
claimed the design of the morning sally; and the Christian hero, who 
affected to despise the enthusiasm of the Arabs, employed the resource 
of a similar superstition. At the principal gate, in the sight of both 
armies, a lofty crucifix was erected; the bishop, with his clergy, accomr 
panied the march, and laid the volume of the New Testament before 
the image of Jesus; and the contending parties were scandalised or 
edified by a prayer that the Son of God would defend his servants and 

00 Vanity prompted the Arabs to believe that Thomas was the son-in-law of 
the emperor. We know the children of Heraclius by his two wives ; and his 
august daughter would not have married in exile at Damascus (see Ducange, 
Fam. Byzantin. p. 118, 119). Had he been less religious, I might only suspect 
the legitimacy of the damseL

vindicate his truth. The battle raged with incessant fury; and the 
dexterity of Thomas, 01 an incomparable archer, was fatal to the boldest 
Saracens, till their death was revenged by a female heroine. The wife 
of Aban, who had followed him to the holy war, embraced her expiring 
husband. if Happy," said she, "happy art thou, my dear: thou art 
gone to thy Lord, who first joined us together, and then parted us 
asunder. I will revenge thy death, and endeavour to the utmost of my 
power to come to the place where thou art, because I love thee. Hence- 
forth shall no man ever touch me more, for I have dedicated myself to 
the service of God." Without a groan, without a tear, she washed the 
corpse of her husband, and buried him with the usual rites. Then 
grasping the manly weapons, which in her native land she was accus- 
tomed to wield, the intrepid widow of Aban sought the place where his 
murderer fought in the thickest of the battle. Her first arrow pierced 
the hand of his standard-bearer; her second wounded Thomas in the 
eye; and the fainting Christians no longer beheld their ensign or their 
leader. Yet the generous champion of Damascus refused to withdraw 
to his palace: his wound was dressed on the rampart; the fight was 
continued till the evening; and the Syrians rested on their arms. In 
the silence of the night, the signal was given by a stroke on the great 
bell; the gates were thrown open, and each gate discharged an impet- 
uous column on the sleeping camp of the Saracens. Chaled was the 
first in arms: at the head of four hundred horse he flew to the post of 
danger, and the tears trickled down his iron cheeks as he uttered a 
fervent ejaculation: " O God, who never sleepest, look upon thy servants, 
and do not deliver them into the hands of their enemies." The valour 
and victory of Thomas were arrested by the presence of the Sword of 
God; with the knowledge of the peril, the Moslems recovered their 
ranks, and charged the assailants in the flank and rear. After the loss 
of thousands, the Christian general retreated with a sigh of de&amp;pair, 
and the pursuit of the Saracens was checked by the military engines 
of the rampart. 

After a siege of seventy days, 62 the patience, and perhaps the provi- 
sions, of the Damascenes were exhausted; and the bravest of their 
chiefs submitted to the hard dictates of necessity. In the occurrences 
of peace and war, they had been taught to dread the fierceness of 

"Al Wakidi (Ockley, p. 101) says, "with poisoned arrows; " but this savage 
invention is so repugnant to the practice of the Greeks and Romans, that I 
must suspect on this occasion the malevolent credulity of the Saracens. 

w Abulfeda allows only seventy days for the siege of Damascus (AnnaL 
Moslem, p. 67, vers. Reiske) ; but Elmacin, who mentions this opinion, prolongs 
the term to six months, and notices the use of balistce by the Saracens (Hist. 
Saracen, p. 25, 32). Even this longer period is insufficient to fill the interval 
between the battle of Aiznadin (July, A.D. 633) and the accession of Omar 
(24th July. A.D. 634), to whose reign the conquest of Damascus is unanimously 
ascribed (Al Wakidi, apud Ockley, vol. i. p. 115; Abulpharagius, Dynast, 
p. 112, vers. Pocock). Perhaps, as in the Trojan war, the operations were 
interrupted by excursions and detachments till the last seventy days of the 
siege.

dialed and to revere the mild virtues of Abu Obeidah. At the hour 
of midnight one hundred chosen deputies of the clergy and people were 
introduced to the tent of that venerable commander. He received and 
dismissed them with courtesy. They returned with a written agree- 
ment, on the faith of a companion of Mohammed, that all hostilities 
should cease; that the voluntary emigrants might depart in safety, with 
as much as they could carry away of their effects; and that the tributary 
subjects of the caliph should enjoy their lands and houses, with the 
use and possession of seven churches. On these terms, the most respect- 
able hostages, and the gate nearest to his camp, were delivered into his 
hands: his soldiers imitated the moderation of their chief; and he 
enjoyed the submissive gratitude of a people whom he had rescued 
from destruction. But the success of the treaty had relaxed their vigi- 
lance, and in the same moment the opposite quarter of the city was 
betrayed and taken by assault. A party of a hundred Arabs had opened 
the eastern gate to a more inexorable foe. " No quarter," cried the 
rapacious and sanguinary Chaled, " no quarter to the enemies of the 
Lord:" his trumpets sounded, and a torrent of Christian blood was 
poured down the streets of Damascus. When he reached the church of 
St. Mary, he was astonished and provoked by the peaceful aspect of 
his companions; their swords were in the scabbard, and they were sur- 
rounded by a multitude of priests and monks. Abu Obeidah saluted 
the general: " God," said he, " has delivered the city into my hands 
by way of surrender, and has saved the believers the trouble of fight- 
ing." " And am 7 not," replied the indignant Chaled, "am I not the 
lieutenant of the commander of the faithful? Have I not taken the city 
by storm? The unbelievers shall perish by the sword. Fall on." The 
hungry and cruel Arabs would have obeyed the welcome command; and 
Damascus was lost, if the benevolence of Abu Obeidah had not been 
supported by a decent and dignified firmness. Throwing himself be- 
tween the trembling citizens and the most eager of the barbarians, he 
adjured them, by the holy name of God, to respect his promise, to sus- 
pend their fury, and to wait the determination of their chifefs. The 
chiefs retired into the church of St. Mary; and after a vehement debate, 
Chaled submitted in some measure to the reason and authority of his 
colleague; who urged the sanctity of a covenant, the advantage as well 
as the honour which the Moslems would derive from the punctual per- 
formance of their word, and the obstinate resistance which they must 
encounter from the distrust and despair of the rest of the Syrian cities, 
It was agreed that the sword should be sheathed, that the part of 
Damascus which had surrendered to Abu Obeidah should be immedi- 
ately entitled to the benefit of his capitulation, and that the final deci- 
sion should be referred to the justice and wisdom of the caliph. 68 A 

*It appears from Abulfeda (p. 125) and Elmacin (p. 32) that this distinc- 
tion of the two parts of Damascus was long remembered, though not always 
respected, by the Mohammedan sovereigns. See likewise Eutychius (Anna! 
torn. ii. p. 379, 380, 383)- 



154 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

.arge majority of the people accepted the terms of toleration and tribute; 
md Damascus is still peopled by twenty thousand Christians. But 
the valiant Thomas, and the free-born patriots who had fought under 
his banner, embraced the alternative of poverty and exile. In the 
adjacent meadow a numerous encampment was formed of priests and 
laymen, of soldiers and citizens, of women and children: they collected, 
with haste and terror, their most precious movables; and abandoned, 
with loud lamentations or silent anguish, their native homes and the 
pleasant banks of the Pharpar. The inflexible soul of Chaled was not 
touched by the spectacle of their distress: he disputed with the Damas- 
cenes the property of a magazine of corn; endeavoured to exclude the 
garrison from the benefit of the treaty; consented, with reluctance, that 
each of the fugitives should arm himself with a sword, or a lance, or a 
bow; and sternly declared, that, after a respite of three days, they 
might be pursued and treated as the enemies of the Moslems. 

The passion of a Syrian youth completed the ruin of the exiles of 
Damascus. A nobleman of the city, of the name of Jonas, 64 was be- 
trothed to a wealthy maiden; but her parents delayed the consumma- 
tion of his nuptials, and their daughter was persuaded to escape with 
the man whom she had chosen. They corrupted the nightly watchmen 
of the gate Keisan; the lover, who led the way, was encompassed by a 
squadron of Arabs; but his exclamation in the Greek tongue, " the 
bird is taken," admonished his mistress to hasten her return. In the 
presence of Chaled, and of death, the unfortunate Jonas professed his 
belief in one God and his apostle Mohammed; and continued, till the 
season of his martyrdom, to discharge the duties of a brave and sincere 
Musulman. When the city was taken, he flew to the monastery where 
Eudocia had taken refuge; but the lover was forgotten; the apostate was 
scorned; she preferred her religion to her country; and the justice of 
Chaled, though deaf to mercy, refused to detain by force a male or female 
inhabitant of Damascus. Four days was the general confined to the city 
by the obligation of the treaty and the urgent cares of his new conquest. 
His appetite for blood and rapine would have been extinguished by the 
hopeless computation of time and distance; but he listened to the im- 
portunities of Jonas, who assured him that the weary fugitives might yet 
be overtaken. At the head of four thousand horse, in the disguise of 
Christian Arabs, Chaled undertook the pursuit. They halted only for the 
moments of prayer; and their guide had a perfect knowledge of the

Hughes has built the Siege of Damascus, one of our most popular tragedies, 
and which possesses the rare merit of blending nature and history, the man- 
ners of the times and the feelings of the heart The foolish delicacy of the 
players compelled him' to soften the guilt of the hero and the despair of the 
heroine. Instead of a base renegade, Phocyas serves the Arabs as an hon- 
ourable ally; instead of prompting their pursuit, he flies to the succour of his 
countrymen, and, after killing Caled and Derar, is himself mortally wounded, 
and expires in the presence of Eudocia, who professes her resolution to take 
th* veil at Constantinople. A frigid catastrophe 1

country. For a long way the footsteps of the Damascenes were plain 
and conspicuous: they vanished on a sudden; but the Saracens were 
comforted by the assurance that the caravan had turned aside into 
the mountains, and must speedily fall into their hands. In traversing 
the ridges of the Libanus they endured intolerable hardships, and 
the sinking spirits of the veteran fanatics were supported and cheered 
by the unconquerable ardour of a lover. From a peasant of the coun- 
try they were informed that the emperor had sent orders to the colony 
of exiles to pursue without delay the road of the sea-coast and of Con- 
stantinople, apprehensive, perhaps, that the soldiers and people of An- 
tioch might be discouraged by the sight and the story of their suffer- 
ings. The Saracens were conducted through the territories of Gabala** 
and Laodicea, at a cautious distance from the walls of the cities; the 
rain was incessant, the night was dark, a single mountain separated them 
from the Roman army; and Chaled, ever anxious for the safety of his 
brethren, whispered an ominous dream in the ear of his companion. 
With the dawn of day the prospect again cleared, and they saw before- 
them, in a pleasant valley, the tents of Damascus. After a short in- 
terval of repose and prayer Chaled divided his cavalry into four squad- 
rons, committing the first to his faithful Derar, and reserving the last 
for himself. They successively rushed on the promiscuous multitude, 
insufficiently provided with arms, and already vanquished by somyw 
and fatigue. Except a captive, who was pardoned and dismissed, the 
Arabs enjoyed the satisfaction of believing that not a Christian of either 
sex escaped the edge of their scimitars. The gold and silver of Damas- 
cus was scattered over the camp, and a royal wardrobe of three hundred 
load of silk might clothe an army of naked barbarians. In the tumult 
of the battle Jonas sought and found the object of his pursuit: but her 
resentment was inflamed by the last act of his perfidy; and as Eudocia 
struggled in his hateful embraces,- she struck a dagger to her heart. 
Another female, the widow of Thomas, and the real or supposed daugh- 
ter of Heradius, was spared and released without a ransom; but the 
generosity of Chaled was the effect of his contempt; and the haughty 
Saracen insulted, by a message, of defiance, the throne of the Caesais* 
Chaled had penetrated above a hundred and fifty miles into the heart of 
the Roman province: he returned to Damascus with the same secrecy 
and speed On the accession of Omar, the Sword of God was removed 
from the command; but the caliph, who blamed the rashness, was com- 
pelled to applaud the vigour and conduct of the enterprise. 

Another expedition of the conquerors of Damascus will equally dis- 
play their avidity and their contempt for the riches of the present world* 

"The towns of Gabak and Laodicea, which the Arabs passed, still exist 
in a state of decay (Maundrell, p. 11, 12; Pocock, vol. ii. p. 13). Had not 
the Christians been overtaken, they must have crossed the Orontes on some 
bridge in tiie sixteen miles between Antioch and the sea, and might have re- 
joined the high road of Constantinople at Alexandria. The Itineraries will 
represent the directions and distances (p. 146, 148, 581, 582, edit Wesseling).

They were informed that the produce and manufactures of the country 
were annually collected in the fair of Abyla, 66 about thirty miles from the 
city; that the cell of a devout hermit was visited at the same time by a 
multitude of pilgrims; and that the festival of trade and superstition 
would be ennobled by the nuptials of the daughter of the governor of 
Tripoli. Abdallah, the son of Jaafar, a glorious and holy martyr, under- 
took, with a banner of five hundred horse, the pious and profitable com- 
mission of despoiling the infidels. As he approached the fair of Abyla, he 
was astonished by the report of the mighty concourse of Jews and Chris- 
tians, Greeks and Armenians, of natives of Syria and of strangers of 
Egypt, to the number of ten thousand, besides a guard of five thousand 
horse that attended the person of the bride. The Saracens paused: " For 
my own part," said Abdallah, " I dare not go back: our foes are many, 
our danger is great, but our reward is splendid and secure, either in this 
life or in the life to come. Let every man, according to his inclination, ad- 
vance or retire." Not a Musulman deserted his standard. " Lead the 
way," said Abdallah to his Christian guide, " and you shall see what the 
companions of the prophet can perform." They charged in five squad- 
rons; but after the first advantage of the surprise they were encompassed 
and almost overwhelmed by the multitude of their enemies; and their 
valiant band is fancifully compared to a white spot in the skin of a black 
camel. 67 About the hour of sunset, when their weapons dropped from 
their hands, when they panted on the verge of eternity, they discovered 
an approaching cloud of dust, they heard the welcome sound of the 
tecbir** and they soon perceived the standard of Chaled, who flew to 
their relief with the utmost speed of his cavalry. The Christians were- 
broken by his attack, and slaughtered in their fig!:;, as far as the river 
of Tripoli. They left behind them the various riches of the fair; the 
merchandises that were exposed for sale, the money that was brought 
for purchase, the gay decorations of the nuptials, and the governor's 
daughter, with forty of her female attendants. The fruits, provisions, 
and furniture, the money, plate, and jewels, were diligently laden on the 
backs of horses, asses, and mules; and the holy robbers returned in 
triumph to Damascus. The hermit, after a short and angry controversy

with Chaled, declined the crown of martyrdom, and was left alive in the 
solitary scene of blood and devastation. 

Syria, 60 one of the countries that have been improved by the most 
early cultivation, is not unworthy of the preference. 70 The heat of the 
climate is tempered by the vicinity of the sea and mountains, by the 
plenty of wood and water; and the produce of a fertile soil affords the 
subsistence, and encourages the propagation, of men and animals. From 
the age of David to that of Heradius, the country was overspread with 
ancient and flourishing cities: the inhabitants were numerous and 
wealthy; and, after the slow ravage of despotism and superstition, after 
the recent calamities of the Persian war, Syria could still attract and 
reward the rapacious tribes of the desert. A plain, of ten days' journey, 
from Damascus to Aleppo and Antioch, is watered, on the western side, 
by the winding course of the Orontes. The hills of Libanus and Anti- 
Libanus are planted from north to south, between the Orontes and the 
Mediterranean; and the epithet of hollow (Ccdesyria) was applied to a 
long and fruitful valley, which is confined in the same direction by the 
two ridges of snowy mountains. 71 Among the cities which are enu- 
merated by Greek and Oriental names in the geography and conquest of 
Syria, we may distinguish Emesa or Hems, Hdiopolis or Baalbec, the 
former as the metropolis of the plain, the latter as the capital of the 
valley. Tinder the last of the Caesars they were strong and populous; 
the turrets glittered from afar: an ample space was covered with public 
and private buildings; and the citizens were illustrious by their spirit,, 
or at least by their pride; by their riches, or at least by their luxury. 
In the days of paganism, both Emesa and Heliopolis were addicted tc 
the worship of Baal, or the sun; but the decline of their superstition 
and splendour has been marked by a singular variety of fortune. Not 

* In the Geography of Abulf eda, the description of Syria, his native country, 
is the most interesting and authentic portion. It was published in Arabic 
and Latin, Lipsiae, 1760, in quarto, with the learned notes of Kochler and 
Reiske, and some extracts of geography and natural history from Ibn Ol 
Wardii. Among the modern travels, Pocock's Description of the East (of 
Syria and Mesopotamia, vol. ii. p. 88-209) is a work of superior learning 
and dignity; but the author too often confounds what he had seen and what 
he had read.

a vestige remains of the temple of Emesa, which was equalled in poetic 
style to the summits of Mount. Libanus, 72 while the ruins of Baalbec, 
invisible to the writers of antiquity, excite the curiosity and wonder of 
the European traveller. 78 The measure of the temple is two hundred 
feet in length and one hundred in breadth: the front is adorned with a 
double portico of eight columns; fourteen may be counted on either 
side; and each column, forty-five feet in height, is composed of three 
massy blocks of stone or marble. The proportions and ornaments of 
the Corinthian order express the architecture of the Greeks: but as 
Baalbec has never been the seat of a monarch, we are at a loss to con- 
ceive how the expense of these .magnificent structures could be supplied 
by private or municipal liberality. 74 From the conquest of Damascus 
the Saracens proceeded to Heliopolis and Emesa: but I shall decline the 
repetition of the sallies and combats which have been already shown 
on a larger scale. In the prosecution of the war their policy was not 
less effectual than their sword. By short and separate truces they dis- 
solved the union of the enemy; accustomed the Syrians to compare their 
friendship with their enmity; familiarised the idea of their language, 
religion, and manners; and exhausted, by clandestine purchase, the 
magazines and arsenals of the cities which they returned to besiege. 
They aggravated the ransom of the more wealthy or the more obstinate; 
and Chalcis alone was taxed at five thousand ounces of gold, five thou- 
sand ounces of silver, two thousand robes of silk, and as many figs and 
olives as would load five thousand asses. But the terms of truce or 
capitulation, were faithfully observed; and the lieutenant of the caliph, 
who had promised not to enter the walls of the captive Baalbec, re- 
mained tranquil and immovable in his tent till the jarring factions 
solicited the interposition of a foreign master. The conquest of the

THE ROMAN EMPIRE 159 

plain and valley of Syria was achieved in less than two years. Yet the 
commander of the faithful reproved the slowness of their progress; and 
the Saracens, bewailing their fault with tears of rage and repentance, 
called aloud on their chiefs to lead them forth to fight the battles of 
tiie Lord. In a recent action, under the walls of Emesa, an Arabian 
youth, the cousin of Chaled, was heard aloud to exclaim, " Methinks I 
see the black-eyed girls looking upon me; one of whom, should sh 
appear in this world, all mankind would die for love of her. And I see 
in the hand of one of them a handkerchief of green silk and a cap of 
precious stones, and she beckons me, and calls out, Come hither quickly, 
for I love thee." With these words, charging the Christians, he made 
havoc wherever he went, till, observed at length by the governor of 
Hems, he was struck through with a javelin. 

It was incumbent on the Saracens to exert the full powers of their 
valour and enthusiasm against the forces of the emperor, who was 
taught, by repeated losses, that the rovers of the desert had undertaken, 
and would speedily achieve, a regular and permanent conquest. From 
the provinces of Europe and Asia, fourscore thousand soldiers were 
transported by sea and land to Antioch and Caesarea: the light troops 
of the army consisted of sixty thousand Christian Arabs of the tribe of 
Gassan. Under the banner of Jabalah, the last of their princes, they 
marched in the van; and it was a maxim of the Greeks, that, for the 
purpose of cutting diamond, a diamond was the most effectual. Hera- 
clius withheld his person from the dangers of the field; but Iris pre- 
sumption, or perhaps his despondency, suggested a peremptory order r 
that the fate of the province and the war should be decided by a single 
battle. The Syrians were attached to the standard of Rome and of the 
cross; but the noble, the citizen, the peasant, were exasperated by the 
injustice and cruelty of a licentious host, who oppressed them as sub- 
jects and despised them as strangers and aliens. 75 A report of these 
mighty preparations was conveyed to the Saracens in their camp of 
Emesa; and the chiefs, though resolved to fight, assembled a council: 
the faith of Abu Obeidah would have expected on the same spot the 
glory of martyrdom; the wisdom of Chaled advised an honourable re- 
treat to the skirts of Palestine and Arabia, where they might await the 
succours of their friends and the attack of the unbelievers. A speedy 
messenger soon returned from the throne of Medina, with the blessings 
of Omar and Ali, tne prayers of the widows of the prophet, and a re- 
inforcement of eight thousand Moslems. In their way they overturned 
a detachment of Greeks; and when they joined at Yermuk the camp- 
of their brethren, they found the pleasing intelligence that Chaled had. 
already defeated and scattered the Christian Arabs of the tribe of Gas- 
san. In the neighbourhood of Bosra, the springs of Mount Hermon

descend in a torrent to the plain of Decapolis, or ten cities; and the 
Hieromax, a name which has been corrupted to Yermuk, is lost, after 
a short course, in the lake of Tiberias. 76 The banks of this obscure 
stream were illustrated by a long and bloody encounter. On this momen- 
tous occasion the public voice and the modesty of Abu Obeidah restored 
the command to the most deserving of the Moslems. Chaled assumed 
his station in the front, his colleague was posted in the rear, that the 
disorder of the fugitives might be checked by his venerable aspect, and 
the sight of the yellow banner which Mohammed had displayed before 
the walls of Chaibar. The last line was occupied by the sister of Derar, 
with the Arabian women who had enlisted in this holy war, who were 
accustomed to wield the bow and the lance, and who in a moment of 
captivity had defended, against the uncircumcised ravishers, their 
chastity and religion. 77 The exhortation of the generals was brief and 
forcible: " Paradise is before you, the devil and hell-fire in your rear." 
Yet such was the weight of the Roman cavalry, that the right wing of 
the Arabs was broken and separated from the main body. Thrice did 
they retreat in disorder, and thrice were they driven back to the charge 
by the reproaches and blows of the women. In the intervals of action, 
Abu Obeidah visited the tents of his brethren, prolonged their repose 
by repeating at once the prayers of two different hours; bound up their 
wounds with his own hands, and administered the comfortable reflec- 
tion that the infidels partook of their sufferings without partaking of 
their reward. Four thousand and thirty of the Moslems were buried 
in the field of battle; and the skill of the Armenian archers enabled seven 
hundred to boast that they had lost an eye in that meritorious service. 
The veterans of the Syrian war acknowledged that it was the hardest 
and most doubtful of lie days which they had seen. But it was likewise 
the most decisive: many thousands of the Greeks and Syrians fell by 
the swords of the Arabs; many were slaughtered, after the defeat, in 
the woods and mountains; many, by mistaking the ford, were drowned 
in the waters of the Yermuk; and however the loss may be magnified, 78 
the Christian writers confess and bewail the bloody punishment of their 
sins. 79 Manuel, the Roman general, was either killed at Damascus, or 

n See Reland, Palestin. torn. i. p. 272, 283, torn. ii. p. 773, 775. This learned 
professor was equal to the task of describing the Holy Land, since he was 
alike conversant with Greek and Latin, with Hebrew and Arabian literature. 
The Yermuk, or Hieromax, is noticed by Cellarius (Geograph. Antiq. torn. ii. 
p. 392) and D'Anville (Geographic Ancienne, torn. ii. p. 185). The Arabs, 
and even Abulfeda himself, do not seem to recognise the scene of their victory. 

" These women were of the tribe of the Hamyarites, who derived their 
origin from the ancient Amalekites. Their females were accustomed to ride 
on horseback, and to fight like the Amazons of old (Ockley, vol. i. p. 67). 

* We killed of them, says Abu Obeidah to the caliph, one hundred and fifty 
thousand, and made prisoners of forty thousand (Ockley, vol. i. p. 241). As 
I cannot doubt his veracity, nor believe his computation, I must suspect that 
the Arabic historians indulged themselves in the practice of composing speeches 
and letters for their heroes. 

"After deploring the sins of the Christians, Theophanes adds ( Chronograph. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 161 

took refuge in the monastery of Mount Sinai. An exile in the Byzantine 
court, Jabalah lamented the manners of Arabia, and his unlucky prefer- 
ence of the Christian cause. 80 He had once inclined to the profession 
of Islam; but in the pilgrimage of Mecca, Jabalah was provoked to 
strike one of his brethren, and fled with amazement from the stern 
and equal justice of the caliph. The victorious Saracens enjoyed at 
Damascus a month of pleasure and repose: the spoil was divided by 
the discretion of Abu Obeidah: an equal share was allotted to a soldier 
and to his horse, and a double portion was reserved for the noble 
coursers of the Arabian breed. 

After the battle of Yermuk the Roman army no longer appeared in 
the field; and the Saracens might securely choose among the fortified 
towns of Syria the first object of their attack. They consulted the caliph 
whether they should march to Caesarea or Jerusalem; and the advice of 
Ali determined the immediate siege of the latter. To a profane eye 
Jerusalem was the first or second capital of Palestine; but after Mecca 
and Medina, it was revered and visited by the devout Moslems as the 
temple of the Holy Land, which had been sanctified by the revelation 
of Moses, of Jesus, and of Mohammed himself. The son of Abu Sophian 
was sent with five thousand Arabs to try the first experiment of surprise 
or treaty; but on the eleventh day the town was invested by the whole 
force of Abu Obeidah. He addressed he customary summons to the 
chief commanders and people of Mtia.** "Health and happiness to 
every one that follows the right wayl We require of you to testify 
that there is but one God, and that Mohammed is his apostle. If you 
refuse this, consent to pay tribute, and be under us forthwith. Other- 
wise I shall bring men against you who love death better than you da 
the drinking of wine or eating hog's flesh. Nor will I ever stir from 
you, if it please God, till I have destroyed those that fight for you, 
and made slaves of your children." But the city was defended on every 
side by deep valleys and steep ascents; since the invasion of Syria the

n In the name of the city, the profane prevailed over the sacred: Jerusalem 
was known to the devout Christians (Euseb. de Martyr. Palest c. xi.) ; but the 
legal and popular appellation of JEKa (the colony of JElius Hadrianus) has 
passed from the Romans to the Arabs. (Reland, Palestin. torn. i. p. 207, tom.^

walls and towers had been anxiously restored; the bravest of the fugi- 
tives of Yermuk had stopped in the nearest place of refuge; and in the 
defence of the sepulchre of Christ the natives and strangers might feel 
some sparks of the enthusiasm which so fiercely glowed in the bosoms 
of the Saracens. The siege of Jerusalem lasted four months; not a day 
was lost without some action of sally or assault; the military engines 
incessantly played from the ramparts; and the inclemency of the winter 
was still more painful and destructive to the Arabs. The Christians 
yielded at length to the perseverance of the besiegers. The patriarch 
Sophronius appeared on the walls, and by the voice of an interpreter 
demanded a conference. After a vain attempt to dissuade the lieutenant 
of the caliph from his impious enterprise, he proposed, in the name of 
the people, a fair capitulation, with this extraordinary clause, that the 
articles of security should be ratified by the authority and presence of 
Omar himself. The question was debated in the council of Medina; 
the sanctity of the place, and the advice of Ali, persuaded the caliph 
to gratify the wishes of his soldiers and enemies; and the simplicity 
of his journey is more illustrious than the royal pageants of vanity 
apd oppression. The conqueror of Persia and Syria was mounted on a 
red camel, which carried, besides his person, a bag of corn, a bag of 
&lt;lates, a wooden dish, and a leathern bottle of water. Wherever he 
halted, the company, without distinction, was invited to partake of 
his homely fare, and the repast was consecrated by the prayer and 
exhortation of the commander of the faithful. 82 But in this expedition 
or pilgrimage his power was exercised in the administration of justice: 
he reformed the licentious polygamy of the Arabs, relieved the tribu- 
taries from extortion and cruelty, and chastised the luxury of the 
Saracens by despoiling them of their rich silks, and dragging them on 
their faces in the dirt. When he came within sight of Jerusalem, the 
caliph cried with a loud voice, " God is victorious: Lord, give us an 
easy conquest 1 " and, pitching his tent of coarse hair, calmly seated 
himself on the ground. After signing the capitulation, he entered the 
city without fear or precaution, and courteously discoursed with the 
patriarch concerning its religious antiquities. 88 Sophronius bowed before 
his new master, and secretly muttered, in the words of Daniel, " The 
abomination of desolation is in the holy place." 84 At the hour of 

"The singular journey and equipage of Omar are described (besides 
Ockley, vol. i. p. 250) by Murtadi (Merveilles de 1'Egypte, p. 260-202). 

* The Arabs boast of an old prophecy preserved at Jerusalem, and describ- 
ing the name, the religion, and the person of Omar, the future conqueror. By 
such arts the Jews are said to have soothed the pride of their foreign 
masters, Cyrus and Alexander (Joseph. Ant. Jud. L xi. c. I [ I, 2], 8 
[ S], P- 547, 579-582).

diction, which had already served for Antiochus and the Romans, was again

&lt;*eeoest theologians of the Monothelite controversy.

prayer they stood together in the church of the Resurrection; but tfte 
caliph refused to perform his devotions, and contented himself -with 
praying on the steps of the church of Constantine. To the patriarch he 
disclosed his prudent and honourable motive. " Had I yielded." said 
Omar, " to your request, the Moslems of a future age would have in- 
fringed the treaty under colour of imitating my example." By his 
command the ground of the temple of Solomon was prepared for the 
foundation of a mosch ; 8B and, during a residence of ten days, he regu- 
lated the present and future state of his Syrian conquests. Medina 
might be jealous lest the caliph should be detained by the sanctity of 
Jerusalem or the beauty of Damascus; her apprehensions were dispelled 
by his prompt and voluntary return to the tomb of the apostle. 86 

To achieve what yet remained of the Syrian war, the caliph had 
formed two separate armies; a chosen detachment, under Amrou and 
Yezid, was left in the camp of Palestine; while the larger division, under 
the standard of Abu Obeidah and Chaled, marched away to the north 
against Antioch and Aleppo. The latter of these, the Beroea of the 
Greeks, was not yet illustrious as the capital of a province or a kingdom; 
and the inhabitants, by anticipating their submission and pleading their 
poverty, obtained a moderate composition for their lives and religion. 
But the castle of Aleppo, 87 distinct from the city, stood erect on a lofty 
artificial mound: the sides were sharpened to a precipice, and faced 
with freestone; and the breadth of the ditch might be filled with water 
from the neighbouring springs. After the loss of three thousand men, 
the garrison was still equal to the defence; and Youkinna, their valiant 
and hereditary chief, had murdered his brother, a holy monk, for daring 
to pronounce the name of peace. In a siege of four or five months, the 
hardest of the Syrian war, great numbers of the Saracens were killed 
and wounded: their removal to the distance of a mile could not seduce 
the vigilance of Youkinna; nor could the Christians be terrified by the 
execution of three hundred captives, whom they beheaded before the 
castle wall. The silence, and at length the complaints, of Abu Obeidah 

88 According to the accurate survey of D'Anville (Dissertation sur rancJerme 
Jerusalem, p. 42-54), the mosch of Omar, enlarged and embellished by suc- 
ceeding caliphs, covered the ground of the ancient temple (v6Xaiov rev p*ykov 
vdov 5dire5oy, says Phocas), a length of 215, a breadth of 172, irises. The 
Nubian geographer declares that this magnificent structure was second only in 
size and beauty to the great mosch of Cordova (p. 113), whose present state 
Mr. Swinburne has so elegantly represented (Travels into Spain, p. 296-302). 

M Of the many Arabic . tarikhs or chronicles of Jerusalem (D'Herbelot, 
p. 867), Ockley found one among the Pocock MSS. of Oxford (vol. i. p. 257), 
which he has used to supply the defective narrative of Al Wakidi. 

87 The Persian historian of Timur (torn. iii. L v. c. 21, p. 300) describes the 
castle of Aleppo as founded on a rock one hundred cubits in height; a proof, 
says the French translator, that he had never visited the place. It is now in 
the midst of the city, of no strength, with a single gate, the circuit is about 
500 or 600 paces, and the ditch half full of stagnant water (Voyages de Taver- 
nier, torn. i. p. 149; Pocock, voL ii. part L p. 150)* The fortresses of the East 
are contemptible to a European eye. 



164 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

informed the caliph that their hope and patience were consumed at the 
foot of this impregnable fortress. " I am variously affected," replied 
Omar, " by the difference of your success; but I charge you by no means 
to raise the siege of the castle. Your retreat would diminish the reputa- 
tion of our arms, and encourage the infidels to fall upon you on all sides. 
Remain before Aleppo till God shall determine the event, and forage 
with your horse round the adjacent country." The exhortation of the 
commander of the faithful was fortified by a supply of volunteers from 
all the tribes of Arabia, who arrived in the camp on horses or camels. 
Among these was Dames, of a servile birth, but of gigantic size and 
intrepid resolution. The forty-seventh day of his service he proposed, 
with only thirty men, to make an attempt on the castle. The experience 
and testimony of Chaled recommended his offer; and Abu Obeidah 
admonished his brethren not to despise the baser origin of Dames, since 
he himself, could he relinquish the public care, would cheerfully serve 
under the banner of the slave. His design was covered by the appear- 
ance of a retreat; and the camp of the Saracens was pitched about a 
league from Aleppo. The thirty adventurers lay in ambush at the foot 
of the hill; and Dames at length succeeded in his inquiries, though he 
was provoked by the ignorance of his Greek captives. " God curse these 
dogs," said the illiterate Arab, "what a strange barbarous language 
they speak! " At the darkest hour of the night he scaled the most 
accessible height, which he had diligently surveyed, a place where the 
stones were less entire, or the slope less perpendicular, or the guard 
less vigilant. Seven of the stoutest Saracens mounted on each other's 
shoulders, and the weight of the column was sustained on the broad and 
sinewy back of the gigantic slave. The foremost in this painful ascent 
could grasp and climb the lowest part of the battlements; they silently 
stabbed and cast down the sentinels; and the thirty brethren, repeating 
a pious ejaculation, " apostle of God, help and deliver us! " were 
successively drawn up by the long folds of their turbans. With bold 
and cautious footsteps Dames explored the palace of the governor, who 
celebrated, in riotous merriment, the festival of his deliverance. From 
thence, returning to his companions, he assaulted on the inside the 
entrance of the castle. They overpowered the guard, unbolted the 
gate, let down the drawbridge, and defended the narrow pass, till the 
arrival of Chaled, with the dawn of day, relieved their danger and 
assured their conquest. Youkinna, a formidable foe, became an active 
and useful proselyte; and the general of the Saracens expressed his 
regard for the most humble merit, by detaining the army at Aleppo 
till Dames was cured of his honourable wounds. The capital of Syria 
was still covered by the castle of Aazaz and the iron bridge of the 
Orontes. After the loss of those important posts, and the defeat of the 
last of the Roman armies, the luxury of Antioch 88 trembled and obeyed. 

* The date of the conquest of Antioch by the Arabs is of some importance.

Her safety -was ransomed with three hundred thousand pieces of gold; 
but the throne of the successors of Alexander, the seat of the Roman 
government in the East, which had been decorated by Caesar with the 
titles of free, and holy, and inviolate, was degraded under the yoke of 
the caliphs to the secondary rank of a provincial town. 89 

In the life of Heradius the glories of the Persian war are clouded on 
either hand by the disgrace and weakness of his more early and his 
later days. When the successors of Mohammed unsheathed the sword 
of war and religion, he was astonished at the boundless prospect of toil 
and danger; his nature .was indolent, nor could the infirm and frigid 
age of the emperor be kindled to a second effort. The sense of shame, 
and the importunities of the Syrians, prevented his hasty departure from 
the scene of action; but the hero was no more; and the loss of Damascus 
and Jerusalem, the bloody fields of Aiznadin and Yermuk, may be im- 
puted in some degree to the absence or misconduct of the sovereign. 
Instead of defending the sepulchre of Christ, he involved the church and 
state in a metaphysical controversy for the unity of his will; and while 
Heradius crowned the offspring of his second nuptials, he was tamely 
stripped of the most valuable part of their inheritance. In the cathedral 
of Antioch, in the presence of the bishops, at the foot of the crucifix, he 
bewailed the sins of the prince and people; but his confession instructed 
the world that it was vain, and perhaps impious, to resist the judgment 
of God. The Saracens were invincible in fact, since they were invincible 
in opinion; and the desertion of Youkinna, his false repentance and 
repeated perfidy, might justify the suspicion of the emperor that he 
was encompassed by traitors and apostates who conspired to betray 
his person and their country to the enemies of Christ In the hour of 
adversity his superstition was agitated by the omens and dreams of a 
falling crown; and after bidding an eternal farewell to Syria, he secretly 
embarked with a few attendants, and absolved the faith of his subjects. 9 * 
Constantine, his eldest son, had been stationed with forty thousand men 
at Caesarea, the civil metropolis of the three provinces of Palestine. But

vol. i. p. 314) assigns that event to Tuesday, August 2ist, an inconsistent date; 
since Easter fell that year on April 5th, the 21 st of August must have been a 
Friday (see the Tables of the Art de Verifier les Dates).

his private interest recalled him to the Byzantine court; and, after 
the flight of his father, he felt himself an unequal champion to the united 
force of the caliph. His vanguard was boldly attacked by three hundred 
Arabs and a thousand black slaves, who, in the depth of winter, had 
climbed the snowy mountains of Libanus, and who were speedily 
followed by the victorious squadrons of Chaled himself. From the 
north and south the troops of Antioch and Jerusalem advanced along 
the seashore till their banners were joined under the walls of the Phoeni- 
cian cities: Tripoli and Tyre were betrayed; and a fleet of fifty trans- 
ports, which entered without distrust the captive harbours, brought a 
seasonable supply of arms and provisions to the camp of the Saracens. 
Their labours were terminated by the unexpected surrender of Caesarea: 
the Roman prince had embarked in the night; 91 and the defenceless 
citizens solicited their pardon with an offering of two hundred thousand 
pieces of gold. The remainder of the province, Ramlah, Ptolemais or 
Acre, Sichem or Neapolis, Gaza, Ascalon, Berytus, Sidon, Gabala, 
Laodicea, Apamea, Hierapolis, no longer presumed to dispute the will 
of the conqueror; and Syria bowed under the sceptre of the caliphs 
seven hundred years after Pompey had despoiled the last of the Mace- 
donian kings. 92 

The sieges and battles of six campaigns had consumed many thousands 
of the Moslems. They died with the reputation and the cheerfulness of 
martyrs; and the simplicity of their faith may be expressed in the words 
of an Arabian youth, when he embraced, for the last time his sister and 
mother: '* It is not," said he, " the delicacies of Syria, or the fading 
delights of this world, that have prompted me to devote my life in the 
cause of religion. But I seek the favour of God and his apostles; and 
I have heard, from one of the companions of the prophet, that the spirits 
of the martyrs! will be lodged in the crops of green birds, who shall taste 
the fruits, and drink of the rivers, of paradise. Farewell: we shall meet 
again among the groves and fountains which God has provided for. his 
elect." The faithful captives might exercise a passive and more arduous 
resolution; and a cousin of Mohammed is celebrated for refusing, after 
an abstinence of three days, the wine and pork, the only nourishment 
that was allowed by the malice of the infidels. The frailty of some 
weaker brethren exasperated the implacable spirit of fanaticism; and 
the father of Amer deplored, in pathetic strains, the apostasy and

Constantinople ; that January i, A.D. 639, the .royal procession visited the great

damnation of a son, who had renounced the promises of God and the 
intercession of the prophet, to occupy, with the priests and deacons, the 
lowest mansions of hell. The more fortunate Arabs who survived the 
war and persevered in the faith were restrained by their abstemious 
leader from the abuse of prosperity. After a refreshment of three days 
Abu Obeidah withdrew his troops from the pernicious contagion of the 
luxury of Antioch, and assured the caliph that their religion and virtue 
could only be preserved by the hard discipline of poverty and labour. 
But the virtue of Omar, however rigorous to himself, was kind and 
liberal to his brethren. After a just tribute of praise and thanksgiving, 
he dropped a tear of compassion; and sitting down on the ground wrote 
an answer in which he mildly censured the severity of his lieutenant: 
" God," said the successor of the prophet, " has not forbidden the use 
of the good things of this world to faithful men, and such as have per- 
formed good works. Therefore you ought to have given them leave to 
rest themselves, and partake freely of those good things which the 
country affordeth. If any of the Saracens have no family in Arabia, they 
may marry in Syria; and whosoever of them wants any female slaves, 
he may purchase as many as he hath occasion for." The conquerors 
prepared to use, or to abuse, this gracious permission; but the year of 
their triumph was marked by a mortality of men and cattle, and twenty" 
five thousand Saracens were snatched away from the possession of 
Syria. The death of Abu Obeidah might be lamented by the Christians ; 
but his brethren recollected that he was one of the ten elect whom the 
prophet had named as the heirs of paradise. 83 Chaled survived his 
brethren about three years; and the tomb of the Sword of God is 
shown in the neighbourhood of Emesa. His valour, which founded in 
Arabia and Syria the empire of the caliphs, was fortified by the opinion 
of a special providence; and as long as he wore a cap which had been, 
blessed by Mohammed, he deemed himself invulnerable amidst ths 
darts of the infidels. 9 * 

The place of the first conquerors was supplied by a new generation of 
their children and countrymen: Syria became the $eat and support of 
the house of Ommiyah; and the revenue, the soldiers, the ships of that 
powerful kingdom were consecrated to enlarge on every side the empire 
of the caliphs. But the Saracens despise a superfluity of fame; and 
their historians scarcely condescend to mention the subordinate con- 
quests which are lost in the splendour and rapidity of their victorious

praises of his disciples. Of Omar he was accustomed to say, that, if a prophet 
could arise after himself, it would be Omar, and that in a general calamity 
Omar would be accepted by the divine justice (Ockley, vol. L p. 221.)

career. To the north of Syria they passed Mount Taurus, and reduced 
to their obedience the province of Cilicia, with its capital Tarsus, the 
ancient monument of the Assyrian kings. Beyond a second ridge of the 
same mountains, they spread the flame of war, rather than the light of 
religion, as far as the shores of the Euxine and the neighbourhood of 
Constantinople. To the east they advanced to the banks and sources 
of the Euphrates and Tigris: 05 the long-disputed barrier of Rome and 
Persia was for ever confounded; the walls of Edessa and Amida, of 
Dara and Nisibis, which had resisted the arijis and engines of Sapor 
or Nushirvan, were levelled in the dust; and the holy city of Abgarus 
might vainly produce the epistle or the image of Christ to an unbeliev- 
ing conqueror. To the west the Syrian kingdom is bounded by the sea: 
and the ruin of Aradus, a small island or peninsula on the coast, was 
postponed during ten years. But the hills of Libanus abounded in 
timber; the trade of Phoenicia, was populous in mariners: and a fleet of 
seventeen hundred barks was equipped and manned by the natives 
of the desert. The Imperial navy of the Romans fled before them from 
the Pamphylian rocks to the Hellespont; but the spirit of the emperor, 
a grandson of Heraclius, had been subdued before the combat by a 
dream and a pun. 00 The Saracens rode masters of the sea; and the 
islands of Cyprus, Rhodes, and the Cyclades were successively exposed 
to their rapacious visits. Three hundred years before the Christian era, 
ttie memorable though fruitless siege of Rhodes, 97 by Demetrius, had 
furnished that maritime republic with the materials and the subject 
of a trophy. A gigantic statue of Apollo, or the sun, seventy cubits in 
height, was erected at the entrance of the harbour, a monument of the 
freedom and the arts of Greece. After standing fifty-six years, the 
colossus of Rhodes was overthrown by an earthquake; but the massy 
trunk, and huge fragments, lay scattered eight centuries on the ground, 
and are often described as one of the wonders of the ancient world. 

* a Al Wakidi had likewise written a history of the conquest of Diarbekir, 
or Mesopotamia (Ockley, at the end of the second vol.), which our inter- 
preters do not appear* to have seen. The Chronicle of Dionysius of Telmar, 
the Jacobite patriarch, records the taking of Edessa A.D. 637, and of Dara 
A.D. 641 (Asseman. Biblioth. Orient, torn. ii. p. 103) ; and the attentive may 
glean some doubtful information from the Chronography of Theophanes 
(p. 285-287 [t i. p. 526, sqq. ed. Bonn]). Most of the towns of Mesopotamia 
yielded by surrender (Abulpharag. p. 112). 

86 He dreamt that he was at Thessalonica, a harmless and unmeaning vision; 
but his soothsayer, or his cowardice, understood the sure omen of a defeat 
concealed in that inauspicious word Ob d\Xg vl^v, Give to another the victory 
(Theoph. p. 287 [vol. i. p. 529, ed Bonn.] ; Zonaras, torn. ii. 1. xiv. [c. 19] p. 88). 
Every passage and every fact that relates to the isle, the city, and the 
colossus of Rhodes, are compiled in the laborious treatise of Meursius, who 
has bestowed the same diligence on the two larger islands of Crete arid Cyprus. 
See, in the third vol. of his works, the Rhodus of Meursius (1. i. c. 15, p. 715- 
719). The Byzantine writers, Theophanes and Constantine, have ignorantly 
prolonged the term to 1360 years, and ridiculously divide *he weight among 
.40,000 camels.

They were collected by the diligence of the Saracens, and sold to a 
Jewish merchant of Edessa, who is said to have laden nine hundred 
camels with the weight of the brass metal: an enormous weight, though 
we should include the hundred colossal figures, 98 and the three thousand 
statues, which adorned the prosperity of the city of the sun. 

III. The conquest of Egypt may be explained by the character of 
the victorious Saracen, one of the first of his nation, in an age when the 
meanest of the brethren was exalted above his nature by the spirit 
of enthusiasm. The birth of Amrou was at once base and illustrious; 
his mother, a notorious prostitute, was unable to decide among the five 
of the Koreish; but the proof of resemblance adjudged the child to 
Aasi, the oldest of her lovers. 98 The youth of Amrou was impelled by 
the passions and prejudices of his kindred: his poetic genius was exer- 
cised in satirical verses against the person and doctrine of Mohammed; 
his dexterity was employed by the reigning faction to pursue the religious 
exiles who had taken refuge in the court of the ^Ethiopian king. 100 
Yet he returned from this embassy a secret proselyte; his reason or his 
interest determined him to renounce the worship of idols; he escaped 
from Mecca with his friend Chaled; and the prophet of Medina enjoyed 
at the same moment the satisfaction of embracing the two firmest cham- 
pions of his cause. The impatience of Amrou to lead the armies of the 
faithful was checked by the reproof of Omar, who advised him not to 
seek power and dominion, since he who is a subject to-day may be a 
prince to-morrow. Yet his merit was not overlooked by the two first 
successors of Mohammed; they were indebted to his arms for the con- 
quest of Palestine; and in all the battles and sieges of Syria he united 
with the temper of a chief the valour of an adventurous soldier. In a 
visit to Medina the caliph expressed a wish to survey the sword which 
had cut down so many Christian warriors: the son of Aasi unsheathed 
a short and ordinary scimitar; and as he perceived the surprise of 
Omar, "Alas," said the modest Saracen, " the sword itself, without the 
arm of its master, is neither sharper nor more weighty than the sword 
of Pharezdak the poet" 101 After the conquest of Egypt he was recalled 
by the jealousy of the caliph Othman; but in the subsequent troubles, 
the ambition of a soldier, a statesman, and an orator, emerged from 
a private station. His powerful support, both in council and in the 
field, established the throne of the Ommiades; the administration and 
revenue of Egypt were restored by the gratitude of Moawiyah to a

Hist. Natur. xxxiv. 18. 

"We learn this anecdote from a spirited old woman, who reviled to their 
faces the caliph and his friend. She was encouraged by the silence of Amrou 
and the liberality of Moawiyah (Abulfeda, Annal. Moslem, p. in).

faithful friend who had raised himself above the rank of a subject; and 
A.mrou ended his days in the palace and city which he had founded on 
the banks of the Nile. His dying speech to his children is celebrated 
by the Arabians as a model of eloquence and wisdom: he deplored the 
errors of his youth; but if the penitent was still infected by the vanity 
of a poet, he might exaggerate the venom and mischief of his impious 
compositions. 102 

From his camp in Palestine Amrou had surprised or anticipated the 
caliph's leave for the invasion of Egypt. 103 The magnanimous Omar 
trusted in his God and his sword, which had shaken the thrones of 
Chosroes and Caesar: but when he compared the slender force of the 
Moslems with the greatness of the enterprise, he condemned his own 
rashness, and listened to his timid companions. The pride and the 
greatness of Pharaoh were familiar to the readers of the Koran; and a 
tenfold repetition of prodigies had been scarcely sufficient to effect, 
not the victory, but the flight, of six hundred thousand of the children 
of Israel: the cities of Egypt were many and populous; their architec- 
ture was strong and solid; the Nile, with its numerous branches, was 
alone an insuperable barrier ; and the granary of the Imperial city would 
be obstinately defended by the Roman powers. In this perplexity the 
commander of the faithful resigned himself to the decision of chance, 
or, in his opinion, of Providence. At the head of only four thousand 
Arabs, the intrepid Amrou had marched away from his station of Gaza 
when he was overtaken by the messenger of Omar. " If you are still 
in Syria," said the ambiguous mandate, " retreat without delay; but if, 
at the receipt of this epistle, you have already reached the frontiers of 
Egypt, advance with confidence, and depend on the succour of God 
and of your brethren." The experience, perhaps the secret intelligence, 
of Amrou had taught him to suspect the mutability of courts; and he 
continued his march till his tents were unquestionably pitched on 
Egyptian ground. He there assembled his officers, broke the seal, 
perused the epistle, gravely inquired the name and situation of the place, 
and declared his ready obedience to the commands of the caliph. After 
a siege of thirty days he took possession of Farmah or Pelusium; and 
that key of Egypt, as it has been justly named, unlocked the entrance 

**For the life and character of Amrou, see Ockley (Hist of the Saracens, 
vol. i. p. 28, 63, 94, 328, 342, 344, and to the end of the volume; vol. ii. p. 51, 
55, 57, 74, 110-112, 162) and Otter (Mem. de I* Academic des Inscriptions, torn. 
xxi. p. 131, 132). The readers of Tacitus may aptly compare Vespasian and 
Mucianus with Moawiyah and Amrou. Yet the resemblance is still more in 
the situation, than in the characters, of the men. 

108 Al Wakidi had likewise composed .a separate history ,of the conquest of 
Egypt, which Mr. Ockley could never procure; and his own inquiries (vol. i 
p. 344-362) have added very little to the original text of Eutychius (Annal. 
torn. ii. p. 296-323, vers. Pocock), the Melchite patriarch of Alexandria, who 
lived three hundred years after the revolution.

of the country as far as the ruins of Heliopolis and .the neighbourhood 
Df the modern Cairo. 

On the western side of the Nile, at a small distance to the east of the 
Pyramids, at a small distance to the south of the Delta, Memphis, one 
hundred and fifty furlongs in circumference, displayed the magnificence 
of ancient kings. Under the reign of the Ptolemies and Caesars, the seat 
of government was removed to the sea-coast; the ancient capital was 
eclipsed by the arts and opulence of Alexandria; the palaces, and at 
length the temples, were reduced to a desolate and ruinous condition: 
yet, in the age of Augustus, and even in that of Constantine, Memphis 
was still numbered among the greatest and most populous of the pro- 
vincial cities. 104 The banks of the Nile, in this place of the breadth 
of three thousand feet, were united by two bridges of sixty and of thirty 
boats, connected in the middle stream by the small island of Rouda, 
which was covered with gardens and habitations. 105 The eastern ex- 
tremity of the bridge was terminated by the town of Babylon and the 
camp of a Roman legion, which protected the passage of the river and 
the second capital of Egypt. This important fortress, which might 
fairly be described as a part of Memphis or Misrah, was invested by the 
arms of the lieutenant of Omar: a reinforcement of four thousand Sara- 
cens soon arrived in his camp; and the military engines, which battered 
the walls, may be imputed to the art and labour of his Syrian allies- 
Yet the siege was protracted to seven months; and the rash invaders 
were encompassed and threatened by the inundation of the Nile. 10 * 
Their last assault was bold and successful: they passed the ditch, which 
had been fortified with iron spikes, applied their scaling-ladders, entered 
the fortress with the shout of " God is victorious! " and drove the 
remnant of the Greeks to their boats and the isle of Rouda. The spot 
was afterwards recommended to the conqueror by the easy communi- 
cation with the gulf and the peninsula of Arabia; the remains of Mem- 
phis were deserted; the tents of the Arabs were converted into permanent

enumerates Memphis among the four cities, maximus urbibus quibus provincia 
nitet (xxii. 16) ; and the name of Memphis appears with distinction in the 
Roman Itinerary and episcopal lists.

the Nile, are only to be found in the Danish traveller and the Nubian geog-

becomes strong and visible in the moon after the summer solstice (Plin. Hist. 
Nat: v. 10), and is usually proclaimed at Cairo on St Peter's day (June 
29). A register of thirty successive years marks the greatest height of the 
waters between July 25 and August 18 (Maillet, Description de TEgypte,

habitations; and the first mosch was blessed by the presence of fourscore 
companions of Mohammed. 107 A new city arose in their camp on the 
eastward bank of the Nile; and the contiguous quarters of Babylon 
and Fostat are confounded in their present decay by the appellation 
of Old Misrah, or Cairo, of which they form an extensive suburb. But 
the name of Cairo, the town of victory, more strictly belongs to the 
modern capital, which was founded in the tenth century by the Fatimite 
caliphs. 108 It has gradually receded from the river; but the continuity 
of buildings may be traced by an attentive eye from the monuments 
of Sesostris to those of Saladin. 100 

Yet the Arabs, after a glorious and profitable enterprise, must have 
retreated to the desert, had they not found a powerful alliance in the 
heart of the country. The rapid conquest of Alexander was assisted by 
the superstition and revolt of the natives; they abhorred their Persian 
oppressors, the disciples of the Magi, who had burnt the temples of 
Egypt, and feasted with sacrilegious appetite on the flesh of die god 
Apis. 110 After a period of ten centuries the same revolution was renewed 
by a similar cause; and in the support of an incomprehensible creed 
the zeal of the Coptic Christians was equally ardent. I have already 
explained the origin and progress of the Monophysite controversy, and 
the persecution of the emperors, which converted a sect into a nation, 
and alienated Egypt from their religion and government. The Saracens 
were received as the deliverers of the Jacobite church; anil a secret and 
effectual treaty was opened during the siege of Memphis between a 
victorious army and a people of slaves. A rich and noble Egyptian, 
of the name of Mokawkas, had dissembled his faith to obtain the admin- 
istration of his province: in the disorders of the Persian war he aspired 
to independence: the embassy of Mohammed ranked him among princes; 
but he declined, with rich gifts and ambiguous compliments, the pro- 
posal of a new religion. 111 The abuse of his trust exposed him to the

" The position of New and Old Cairo is well known, and has been often 
described. Two writers who were intimately acquainted with ancient and 
modern Egypt have fixed, after a learned inquiry, the city of Memphis at 
Gtzeh, directly opposite the Old Cairo (Sicard, Nouyeaux Memoires des Mis- 
sions du Levant, torn. vi. p. 5, 6 ; Shaw's Observations and Travels, p. 296- 
304). Yet we may not disregard the authority or the arguments of Pocock 
(vol. i. p. 25-41), Niebuhr (Voyage, torn. i. p. 77-106}, and, above all, of 
D'Anville (Description de TEgypte, p. in, 112, 130-149;, who have removed 
Memphis towards the village of Mohannah, some miles farther to the south. 
In their heat the disputants have forgot that the ample space of a metropolis 
covers and annihilates the far greater part of the controversy.

resentment of Heraclius: his submission was delayed by arrogance and 
fear; and his conscience was prompted by interest to throw himself on 
the favour of the nation and the support of the Saracens. In his first 
conference with Amrou he heard without indignation the usual option, 
of the Koran, the tribute, or the sword. " The Greeks," replied Mo- 
kawkas, "are determined to abide the determination of the sword; but 
with the Greeks I desire no communion, either in this world or in the 
next, and I abjure for ever the Byzantine tyrant, his synod of Chalcedon, 
and his Mdchite slaves. For myself and my brethren, we are resolved 
to live and .die in the profession of the gospel and unity of Christ. It is 
impossible for us to embrace the revelations of your prophet; but we 
are desirous of peace, and cheerfully submit to pay tribute and obedience 
to his temporal successors." The tribute was ascertained at two pieces 
of gold for the head of every Christian; but old men, monks, women, 
and children of both sexes under sixteen years of age, were exempted 
from this personal assessment: the Copts above and below Memphis 
swore allegiance to the caliph, and promised an hospitable entertain- 
ment of three days to every Musulman who should travel through thei: 
country. By this charter of security the ecclesiastical and civil tyranny 
of the Melchites was destroyed: 112 the anathemas of St. Cyril were 
thundered from every pulpit; and the sacred edifices, with the patrimony 
of the church, were restored to the national communion of the Jacobites, 
who enjoyed without moderation the moment of triumph and revenge. 
At the pressing summons of Amrou, their patriarch Benjamin emerged 
from his desert; and, after the first interview, the courteous Arab affected 
to declare that he had never conversed with a Christian priest of more 
innocent manners and a more venerable aspect 118 In the march from 
Memphis to Alexandria the lieutenant of Omar intrusted his safety to 
the zeal and gratitude of the Egyptians: the roads and bridges were 
diligently repaired; and in every step of his progress he could depend 
on a constant supply of provisions and intelligence* The Greeks of 
Egypt, whose numbers could scarcely equal a tenth of the natives, were 
overwhelmed by the universal defection: they had ever been hated, 
they were no longer feared: the magistrate fled from his tribunal, the 

white linen of Egypt, with a horse, a mule, and an ass, distinguished by their 
respective qualifications. The embassy of Mohammed was despatched from 
Medina in the seventh year of the Hegira (A.D. 628). See Gagnier (Vie de 
Mahomet, torn. ii. p. 255, 256, 303), from Al Jannabi. 

^The prefecture of Egypt, and the conduct of the war, had been trusted 
by Heraclius to the patriarch Cyrus (Theophan. p. 280, 281 [t i. p. 518. 
519, ed. Bonn.]). "In Spain," said James II., "do you not consult your 
priests ? " " We do," replied the Catholic ambassador, " and our affairs succeed 
accordingly." I know not how to relate the plans of Cyrus, of paying 
tribute without impairing lie revenue, and of converting Omar by his mar- 
riage with the emperor's daughter (Nicephor. Breviar. p. 17, 18 [ed. Par. 
1648]).

bishop from his altar ; and the distant garrisons were surprised or starved 
by the surrounding multitudes. Had not the Nile afforded a safe and 
ready conveyance to the sea, not an individual could have escaped who 
by birth, or language, or office, or religion, was connected with their 
odious name. 

By the retreat of the Greeks from the provinces of Upper Egypt a con- 
siderable force was collected in the island of Delta; the natural and 
artificial channels of the Nile afforded a succession of strong and de- 
fensible posts; and the road to Alexandria was laboriously cleared by 
the victory of the Saracens in two-and-twenty days of general or partial 
combat. In their annals of conquest the siege of Alexandria 114 is perhaps 
the most arduous and important enterprise. The first trading city in 
the world was abundantly replenished with the means of subsistence 
and defence. Her numerous inhabitants fought for the dearest of human 
rights, religion and property; and the enmity of the natives seemed to 
exclude them from the common benefit of peace and toleration. The sea 
was continually open; and if Heraclius had been awake to the public 
distress, fresh armies of Romans and barbarians might have been poured 
into the harbour to save the second capital of the empire. A circum- 
ference of ten miles would have scattered the forces of the Greeks, and 
favoured the stratagems of an active enemy; but the two sides of an 
oblong square were covered by the sea and lie lake Maraeotis, and each 
of the narrow ends exposed a front of no more than ten furlongs. The 
efforts of the Arabs were not inadequate to the difficulty of the attempt 
and value of the prize. From the throne of Medina the eyes of Omar 
were fixed on the camp and city: his voice excited to arms the Arabian 
tribes and the veterans of Syria; and the merit of a holy war was recom- 
mended by the peculiar fame and fertility of Egypt. Anxious for the 
ruin or expulsion of their tyrants, the faithful natives devoted their 
labours to the service of Amrou; some sparks of martial spirit were 
perhaps rekindled by the example of their allies; and the sanguine hopes 
of Mokawkas had fixed his sepulchre in the church of St. John of Alex- 
andria. Eutychius, the patriarch, observes that the Saracens fought with 
the courage of lions; they repulsed the frequent and almost daily sallies 
of the besieged, and soon assaulted in their turn the walls and towers 
of the city. In every attack the sword, the banner of Amrou, glittered 
in the van of the Moslems. On a memorable day he was betrayed by 
his imprudent valour: his followers who had entered the citadel were 
driven back; and the general, with a friend and a slave, remained a 
prisoner in the hands of the Christians. When Amrou was conducted 
before the prefect, he remembered his dignity, and forgot hi$ situation: 

114 The local description of Alexandria is perfectly ascertained by the 
master-hand of the first of geographers (D'Anville, Meraoire sur 1'Egypte, 
p. 52-63); but we may borrow the eyes of the modern travellers, more 
especially of Thevenot (Voyage an Levant, part i. p. 381-395), Pocock (vol. i. 
p. 2-13), and Niebuhr (Voyage en Arabic, torn. i. p. 34-43). Of the two

a lofty demeanour and resolute language revealed the lieutenant of the 
caliph, and the battle-axe of a soldier was already raised to strike off 
the head of the audacious captive. His life was saved by the readiness 
of his slave, who instantly gave his master a blow on the face, and com- 
manded him with an angry tone to be silent in the presence of his 
superiors. The credulous Greek was deceived: he listened to the ofier 
of a treaty, and his prisoners were dismissed in the hope of a more 
respectable embassy, till the joyful acclamations of the camp announced 
the return of their general, and insulted the folly of the infidels. At 
length, after a siege of fourteen months, 115 and the loss of three-and- 
twenty thousand men, the Saracens prevailed: the Greeks embarked their 
dispirited and diminished numbers, and the standard of Mohammed was 
planted on the walls of the capital of Egypt. " I have taken," said Amrou 
to the caliph, " the great city of the West. It is impossible for me to 
enumerate the variety of its riches and beauty; and I ^Ml content 
myself with observing that it contains four thousand palaces, four thou- 
sand baths, four hundred theatres or places of amusement, twelve 
thousand shops for the sale of vegetable food, and forty thousand tribu- 
tary Jews. The town has been subdued by force of arms, without treaty 
or capitulation, and the Moslems are impatient to seize the fruits of their 
victory." 11C The commander of the faithful rejected witli firmness the 
idea of pillage, and directed his lieutenant to reserve the wealth and 
revenue of Alexandria for the public service and the propagation of the 
faith: the inhabitants were numbered; a tribute was imposed; the zeal 
and resentment of the Jacobite were curbed, and the Melchites who 
submitted to the Arabian yoke were indulged in the obscure but tranquil 
exercise of their worship. The intelligence of this disgraceful and calami- 
tous event afflicted the declining health of the emperor; and Heraclms 
died of a dropsy about seven weeks after the loss of Alexandria. 117 
Under the minority of his grandson the clamours of the people deprived 
of their daily sustenance compelled the Byzantine court to undertake

p. 28) concur in fixing the taking of Alexandria to Friday of the new moon 
of Moharram of the twentieth year of the Hegira (December 22, A.D. 640). 
In reckoning backwards fourteen months spent before Alexandria, seven 
months before Babylon, etc., Amrou might have invaded Egypt about the 
end of the year 638: but we are assured that he entered the country the I2th 
of Bayni* 6th of June (Murtardi, Merveilles de 1'Egypte, p* 164; Severus, 
apud Renaudot, p. 162). The Saracen, and, afterwards Lewis IX. of France, 
halted at Pelusium, or Damietta, during the season of the inundation of the 
Nile.

the Chronicon Orientale the true date of the death of Heraclms, February 
nth, A.D. 641, fifty 'days after the loss of Alexandria, A fourth of that 
time was sufficient to convey the intelligence.

the recovery of the capital of Egypt. In the space of four years the 
harbour and fortifications of Alexandria were twice occupied by a fleet 
and army of Romans. They were twice expelled by the valour of Amrou, 
who was recalled by the domestic peril from the distant wars of Tripoli 
and Nubia. But the facility of the attempt, the repetition of the insult, 
and the obstinacy of the resistance, provoked him to swear that, if a 
third time he drove the infidels into the sea, he would render Alexandria 
as accessible on all sides as the house of a prostitute. Faithful to his 
promise, he dismantled several parts of the walls and towers; but the 
people was spared in the chastisement of the city, and the mosch of 
Mercy was erected on the spot where the victorious general had stopped 
the fury of his troops. 

I should deceive the expectation of the reader if I passed in silence 
the fate of the Alexandrian library, as it is described by the learned 
Abulpharagius. The spirit of Amrou was more curious and liberal than 
that of his brethren, and in his leisure hours the Arabian chief was 
pleased with the conversation of John, the last disciple of Ammonius, 
and who derived the surname of Philoponus from his laborious studies 
of grammar and philosophy. 118 Emboldened by this familiar intercourse, 
Philoponus presumed to solicit a gift, inestimable in his opinion, con- 
temptible in that of the barbarians the royal library, which alone, 
among the spoils of Alexandria, had not been appropriated by the visit 
and the seal of the conqueror. Amrou was inclined to gratify the wish 
of the grammarian, but his rigid integrity refused to alienate the minutest 
object without the consent of the caliph: and the well-known answer of 
Omar was inspired by the ignorance of a fanatic. " If these writings of 
the Greeks agree with the book of God, they are useless and need not 
he preserved: if they disagree, they are pernicious and ought to be 
destroyed." The sentence was executed with blind obedience: the vol- 
umes of paper or parchment were distributed to the four thousand baths 
of the city; and such was their incredible multitude, that six months 
were barely sufficient for the consumption of this precious fuel. Since 
the Dynasties of Abulpharagius lig have been given to the world in a 
Latin version, the tale has been repeatedly transcribed; and every 
scholar, with pious indignation, has deplored the irreparable shipwreck 
of the learning, the arts, and the genius of antiquity. For my own part,

commentaries, one of which is dated as early as May loth, A.D. 617 (Fabric. 
Biblioth. Graec. torn. ix. p. 458-468). A modern (John Le Clerc), who some- 
times assumed the same name, was equal to old Philoponus in diligence, and 
far superior in good sense and real knowledge.

I am strongly tempted to deny both the fact and the consequences. The 
fact is indeed marvellous. " Read and wonder! " says the historian 
himself: and the solitary report of a stranger who wrote at the end of 
six hundred years on the confines of Media is overbalanced by the 
silence of two annalists of a more early date, both Christians, both 
natives of Egypt, and the most ancient of whom, the patriarch Euty- 
chius, has amply described the conquest of Alexandria. 120 The rigid 
sentence of Omar is repugnant to the sound and orthodox precept of the 
Mohammedan casuists: they expressly declare that the religious books 
of the Jews and Christians, which are acquired by the right of war, 
should never be committed to the flames; and that the works of pro- 
fane science, historians or poets, physicians or philosophers, may be 
lawfully applied to the use of the faithful. 131 A more destructive zeal 
may perhaps be attributed to the first successors of Mohammed; yet 
in this instance the conflagration would have speedily expired in the 
deficiency of materials. I shall not recapitulate the disasters of the 
Alexandrian library, the involuntary flame that was kindled by Caesar 
in his own defence, 122 or the mischievous bigotry of the Christians, who 
studied to destroy the monuments of idolatry. 128 But if we gradually 
descend from the age of the Antonines to that of Theodosius, we shall 
learn from a chain of contemporary witnesses that the royal palace and 
the temple of Serapis no longer contained the four, or the seven, hundred 
thousand volumes which had been assembled by the curiosity and mag- 
nificence of the Ptolemies. 12 * Perhaps the church and seat of the patri- 

130 This curious anecdote will be vainly sought in the annals of Eutychius, 
and the Saracenic history of Elmaciru The silence of Abulfeda, Murtadi, and 
a crowd of Moslems, is less conclusive, from their ignorance of Christian 
literature. 

121 See Reland, de Jure Militari Mohammedanorum, in his third volume of 
Dissertations, p. 37. The reason for not burning the religious books of the 
Jews or Christians is derived from the respect that is due to the name of God. 

[There seems now to be grave doubt thrown upon the story of the burning 
of the Alexandrian library. Prof. Bury here states a circumstance that must 
weigh strongly with all who wish to reach the truth in regard to this matter. 
The origin of the story^ is perhaps to be sought in the actual dtstruction of 
religious books in Persia. Ibn Khaldum, as quoted by Hajji Khalifa, states 
that Omar authorised some Persian books to be thrown into the water, basing 
his decision on the same dilemma which, according to Abulpharagius, he 
enunciated to Amrou. It is quite credible that books of the fire worshippers 
were destroyed by Omar's orders; and this incident might have originated 
legends of the destruction of books elsewhere. O. S.]

Usher (AnnaL p. 469). Livy himself had styled the Alexandrian Horary, 
elegantise regum curaeque egregium opus a liberal encomium, for which he is 
pertly criticised by the narrow stoicism of Seneca (De Tranquillitate Animi, 
c. 9), whose wisdom on this occasion deviates into nonsense.

archs might be enriched with a repository of books; but if the ponderous 
mass of Arian and Monophysite controversy were indeed consumed in 
the public baths, 125 a philosopher may allow, with a smile, that it was 
ultimately devoted to the benefit of mankind. I sincerely regret the 
more valuable libraries which have been involved in the ruin of the 
Roman empire; but when I seriously compute the lapse of ages, the 
waste of ignorance, and the calamities of war, our treasures, rather than 
our losses, are the object of my surprise. Many curious and interesting 
facts are buried in oblivion: the three great historians of Rome have 
been transmitted to our hands in a mutilated state; and we are deprived 
.of many pleasing compositions of the lyric, iambic, and dramatic poetry 
of the Greeks. Yet we should gratefully remember that the mischances of 
time and accident have spared the classic works to which the suffrage 
of antiquity 128 had adjudged the first place of genius and glory: the 
teachers of ancient knowledge, who are still extant, had perused and 
compared the writings of their predecessors; 127 nor can it fairly oe 
presumed that any important truth, any useful discovery in art DT nature, 
has been snatched away from the curiosity of modern ages. 

In the administration of Egypt, 128 Amrou balanced the demands of 
justice and policy; the interest of the people of the law, who were de- 
fended by God; and of the people of tibfe alliance, who were protected 
by man. In the recent tumult of conquest and deliverance, the tongue 
of the Copts and the sword of the Arabs were most adverse to the tran- 
quillity of the province. To the former, Amrou declared that faction 
and falsehood would be doubly chastised by the punishment of the 
accusers, whom he should detest as his personal enemies, j,nd by the 
promotion of their innocent brethren, whom their envy hac 3 laboured 
to injure and supplant. He excited the lattei :&gt;y the motives of religion 
and honour to sustain the dignity of their character, to endear them- 
selves by a modest and temperate conduct ,o God and the caliph, to 
spare and protect a people who had trusted :c their faith, and to content 
themselves with the legitimate and splendid rewards of their victory. 
In the management of the revenue he disapproved the simple out oppres-

real loss from their exclusion.

sive mode of a capitation, and preferred with reason a proportion of 
taxes deducted on every branch from the dear profits of agriculture and 
commerce. A third part of the tribute was appropriated to the annual 
repairs of the dykes and canals, so essential to the public welfare. Under 
his administration the fertility of Egypt supplied the dearth of Arabia; 
and a string of camels, laden with corn and provisions, covered almost 
without an interval the long road from Memphis to Medina. 120 But the 
genius of Amrou soon renewed the maritime communication which had 
been attempted or achieved by the Pharaohs, the Ptolemies, or the 
Casars; and a canal, at least eighty miles in length, was opened from 
the Nile to the Red Sea, This inland navigation, which would have 
joined the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, was soon discontinued 
as useless and dangerous: the throne was removed from Medina to 
Damascus, and the Grecian fleets might have explored a passage to the 
holy cities of Arabia. 180 

Of his new conquest the caliph Omar had an imperfect knowledge 
from the voice of fame and the legends of the Koran. He requested 
that his lieutenant would place before his eyes the realm of Pharaoh and 
the Amalekites; and the answer of Amrou exhibits a lively and not un- 
faithful picture of that singular country. 131 " O commander of the faith- 

"'Eutychius, Annal. torn. ii. p. 320. Elmacin,, Hist Saracen, p. 35. 

"* On these obscure canals the reader may try to satisfy himself from 
D'Anville (Mem. sur 1'Egypte, p. 108-110, 124, 132), and a learned thesis, 
maintained and printed at Strasburg in the year 1770 (Jungendorum marium 
fluviorumque molimina, p. 39-47, 68-70). Even the supine Turks have agitated 
the old project of joining the two seas (M&amp;noires du Baron de Tott, torn. iv.). 

[It is unquestionable that there was anciently a canal following a. line 
something similar to that of the Suez Canal of to-day. Both classical au- 
thority and Arabian tradition unite in testifying to the existence of a canal 
between the Nile and the Red Sea. It was begun by Nechos, the son of 
Psammetichus, but left unfinished till completed by Darius, the son of Hys- 
taspes. This line began a little above Bubastis on the Pelusiac branch of the 
Nile (Herodot. ii. 158). Having become choked with sand, it was restorer! 
by Ptolemy Philadelphus, who, however, placed its head farther north, in 
the neighbourhood df Phacusa. Another fine, derived from the Nile above 
the Delta, seems to have been subsequently added. The canal was evidently 
navigable in the time of Augustus, but it seems to have become useless hi 
the tune of Pliny the elder. It was, however, repaired by Trajan, and we know 
from Lucian that it was navigable in the second century in his time. The 
line, as restored by Amrou, began at Babylon (or Fostat), ran northward to 
Bilbeis, then eastward through the valley of Tomlat, to the ruins of Heroop- 
oHs, whence it took a southerly direction and entered the Red Sea at Kolzum, 
near the spot where Suez has subsequently risen. It must, therefore, have 
followed the same line as in the time of Trajan; and as Amrou succeeded in 
a year or two in rendering it again navigable, we may conclude that the ancient 
works remained in a tolerable degree of preservation. O. SJ 

m A small volume, des Merveilles, etc., de 1'Egypte, composed in the thir- 
teenth century by Murtadi of Cairo, and translated from an Arabic MS. of 
Cardinal Mazarin, was published by Pierre Vatier, Paris, 1666. The an- 
tiquities of Egypt are wild and legendary; but the writer deserves credit and 
esteem for his account of the conquest and geography of his native country 
(see the Correspondence of Amrou and Omar, p. 270-289).

ful, Egypt is a compound of black earth and green plants, between a 
pulverised mountain and a red sand. The distance from Syene to the sea 
is a month's journey for a horseman. Along the valley descends a river, 
on which the blessing of the Most High reposes both in the evening and 
morning, and which rises and falls with the revolutions of the sun and 
moon. When the annual dispensation of Providence unlocks the springs 
and fountains that nourish the earth, the Nile rolls his swelling and 
sounding waters through the realm of Egypt: the fields are overspread 
by the salutary flood; and the villages communicate with each other 
in their painted barks. The retreat of the inundation deposits a fertilising 
mud for the reception of the various seeds: the crowds of husbandmen 
who blacken the land may be compared to a swarm of industrious ants; 
and their native indolence is quickened by the lash of the taskmaster 
and the promise of the flowers and fruits of a plentiful increase. Their 
hope is seldom deceived; but the riches which they extract from the 
wheat, the barley, and the rice, the legumes, the fruit-trees, and the 
cattle, are unequally shared between those who labour and those who 
possess. According to the vicissitudes of the seasons, the face of the 
country is adorned with a silver wave, a verdant emerald, and the deep 
yellow of a golden harvest" 182 Yet this beneficial order is sometimes 
interrupted; and the long delay and sudden swell of the river in the 
first year of the conquest might afford some colour to an edifying fable. 
It is said that the annual sacrifice of a virgin 1SB had been interdicted 
by the piety of Omar; and that the Nile lay sullen and inactive in his 
shallow bed, till the mandate of the caliph was cast into the obedient 
stream, which rose in a single night to the height of sixteen cubits. The 
admiration of the Arabs for their new conquest encouraged the license 
of their romantic spirit. We may read, in the gravest authors, that 
Egypt was crowded with twenty thousand cities or villages: 1S * that, 
exclusive of the Greeks and Arabs, the Copts alone were found, on the

that varying scene the Nile (Lettre ii., particularly p. 70, 75) ; the fertility 
of the land (Lettre ix.). From a college at Cambridge the poetic eye of Gray 
had seen the same objects with a keener glance : 

What wonder in the sultry climes that spread, 
Where Nile, redundant o'er his summer bed, 
From his broad bosom life and verdure flings, 
And broods o'er Egypt with his wat'ry wings, 
If with advent* rous oar, and ready sail,

Or on frail floats to neighbouring cities ride, 
That rise and glitter o'er the ambient tide.

assessment, six millions of tributary subjects, 186 or twenty millions of 
either sex and of every age: that three hundred millions of gold or silver 
were annually paid to the treasury of the caliph. 138 Our reason must be 
startled by these extravagant assertions; and they will become more 
palpable if we assume the compass and measure the extent of habitable 
ground: a valley from the tropic to Memphis seldom broader than twelve 
miles, and the triangle of the Delta, a flat surface of two thousand one 
hundred square leagues, compose a twelfth part of the magnitude of 
France. 187 A more accurate research will justify a more reasonable 
estimate. The three hundred millions, created by the error of a scribe, 
are reduced to the decent revenue of four millions three hundred thousand 
pieces of gold, of which nine hundred thousand were consumed by the 
pay of the soldiers. 188 Two authentic lists, of the present and of the 
twelfth century, are circumscribed within the respectable number of 
two thousand seven hundred villages and towns. 189 After a long resi- 
dence at Cairo, a French consul has ventured to assign about four 
millions of Mohammedans, Christians, and Jews, for the ample, though 
not incredible, scope of the population of Egypt. 140

des Arts, etc. torn. iiL p. 26, etc.) bestows twenty-seven millions on ancient 
Egypt* because the seventeen hundred companions of Sesostris were born 
on the same day.

understand it of the total Coptic population and not (with Eutychius) of the 
male adults alone. In the reign of Nero, A.D. 66, Egypt, exclusive of Alex-

IV. The conquest of Africa, from the Nile to the Atlantic Ocean, 14 * 
was first attempted by the arms of the caliph Othman. The pious design 
was approved by the companions of Mohammed and the chiefs of the 
tribes; and twenty thousand Arabs marched from Medina, with the 
gifts and the blessing of the commander of the faithful. They were 
joined in the camp of Memphis by twenty thousand of their country- 
men; and the conduct of the war was intrusted to Abdallah, 142 the son 
of Said and the foster-brother of the caliph, who had lately supplanted 
the conqueror and lieutenant of Egypt. Yet the favour of the prince, 
and the merit of his favourite, could not obliterate the guilt of his 
apostacy. The early conversion of Abdallah, and his skilful pen, had 
recommended him to the important office of transcribing the sheets of 
the Koran: he betrayed his trust, corrupted the text, derided the errors 
which he had made, and fled to Mecca to escape the justice, and expose 
the ignorance, of the apostle. After the conquest of Mecca he fell pros- 
trate at the feet of Mohammed: his tears, and the entreaties of Othman, 
extorted a reluctant pardon; but the prophet declared that he had so long 
hesitated, to allow time for some zealous disciple to avenge his injury 
in the blood of the apostate. With apparent fidelity and effective merit 
he served the religion which it was no longer his interest to desert: his 
birth and talents gave him an honourable rank among the Koreish; and, 
in a nation of cavalry, Abdallah was renowned as the boldest and most 
dexterous horseman of Arabia. At the head of forty thousand Moslems 
he advanced from Egypt into the unknown countries of the West. The 



with the reading of the French consul. He was ignorant of Greek 
and Latin literature, and his fancy is too much delighted with the fictions 
of the Arabs. Their best knowledge is collected by Abulfeda (Descript. 
JEgypt. Arab, et Lat. 4 Joh. David Michaelis, Gottingae, in 4to, 1776) ; and 
in two recent voyages into Egypt, we are amused by Savary, and instructed 
by Volney. I wish the latter could travel over the globe. 

141 My conquest of Africa is drawn from two French interpreters of Arabic 
literature, Cardonne (Hist, de 1'Afrique et de 1'Espagne sous la Domination 
des Arabes, torn. i. p. 8-55) and Otter (Hist de 1* Academic des Inscriptions, 
tout xxi. p. 111-125 and 136). They derive their principal information from 
Novairi, who composed, A.D. 1331, an Encyclopaedia in more than twenty 
volumes. The five general parts successively treat of, I. Physics; 2. Man; 
3. Animals; 4. Plants; and 5. History; and the African affairs are discussed 
in the sixth chapter of the fifth section of this last part (Reiske, Prodidag- 
mata ad Hagji Chalifse Tabulas, pi 232-234). Among the older historians 
who are quoted by Novairi we may distinguish the original narrative of a, 
soldier who led the van of the Moslems.

sands of Barca might be impervious to a Roman legion; but tie Arabs 
were attended by their faithful camels; and the natives of the desert 
beheld without terror the familiar aspect of the soil and climate. After a 
painful march they pitched their tents before the walls of Tripoli, 143 a 
maritime city in which the name, the wealth, and the inhabitants of the 
province had gradually centred, and which now maintains the third 
rank among the states of Barbary. A reinforcement of Greeks was sur- 
prised and cut in pieces on the sea-shore; but the fortifications of Tripoli 
resisted the first assaults; and the Saracens were tempted by the ap- 
proach of the praefect Gregory 144 to relinquish the labours of the si^ge 
for the perils and the hopes of a decisive action. If his standard was 
followed by one hundred and twenty thousand men, the regular bands 
af the empire must have been lost in the naked and disorderly crowd of 
Africans and Moors, who formed the strength, or rather the numbers, 
of his host. He rejected with indignation, the option of the Koran or 
the tribute; and during several days the two armies were fiercely engaged 
from the dawn of light to the hour of noon, when their fatigue and the 
excessive heat compelled them to seek shelter and refreshment in their 
respective camps. The daughter of Gregory, a maid of incomparable 
beauty and spirit, is said to have fought by his side: from her earliest 
youth she was trained to mount on horseback, to draw the bow, and 
to wield the scimitar; and the richness of her arms and apparel were 
conspicuous in the foremost ranks of the battle. Her hand, with a 
hundred thousand pieces of gold, was offered for the head of the Arabian 
general, and the youths of Africa were excited by the prospect of the 
glorious prize. At the pressing solicitation of his brethren, Abdallah 
withdrew his person from the field; but the Saracens were discouraged 
by the retreat of their leader, and the repetition of these equal or un- 
successful conflicts. 

A noble Arabian, who afterwards became the adversary of AH, aid 
the father of a caliph, had signalised his valour in Egypt, and Zobeir 14 *

Navigatione et Viaggi di Ramusio, torn. i. Venetia, 1550, foL 76 verso) and

was a Moor, a- scholar, and a traveller, who composed or translated his 
African geography in a state of captivity at Rome, where he had assumed 
the name and religion of Pope Leo X. In a similar captivity among the 
Moors, the Spaniard Marmol, a soldier of Charles V., compiled his De- 
scription of Africa, translated by D'Ablancourt into French (Paris, 1667,

On the news of the battle, Zobeir, with twelve companions, cut his way

either food or repose, to partake of the dangers of his brethren. He

said Zobeir, " on the infidels their ungenerous attempt. Proclaim through 
the ranks that the head of Gregory shall be repaid with his captive 
daughter, and the equal sum of one hundred thousand pieces of gold." 
To the courage and discretion of Zobeir the lieutenant of the caliph in- 
trusted the execution of his own stratagem, which inclined the long- 
disputed balance in favour of the Saracens. Supplying by activity and 
artifice the deficiency of numbers, a part of their forces lay concealed 
in their tents, while the remainder prolonged an irregular skirmish with 
the enemy till the sun was high in the heavens. On both sides they 
retired with fainting steps: their horses were unbridled, their armour 
was laid aside, and the hostile nations prepared, or seemed to prepare, 
for the refreshment of the evening, and the encounter of the ensuing 
day. On a sudden the charge was sounded; the Arabian camp poured 
forth a swarm of fresh and intrepid warriors; and the long line of the 
Greeks and Africans was surprised, assaulted, overturned, by new squad- 
rons of the faithful, who, to the eye of fanaticism, might appear as a 
band of angels descending from the sky. The praefect himself was slain 
by the hand of Zobeir: his daughter, who sought revenge and death, was 
surrounded and made prisoner; and the fugitives involved in their 
disaster the town of Sufetula, to which they escaped from the sabres 
and lances of the Arabs. Sufetula was built one hundred and fifty miles 
to the south of Carthage: a gentle declivity is watered by a running 
stream, and shaded by a grove of juniper-trees; and, in the ruins of a 
triumphal arch,. a portico, and three temples of the Corinthian order, 
curiosity may yet admire the magnificence of the Romans. 146 After the 
fall of this opulent city, the provincials and barbarians implored on all 
sides the mercy of the conqueror. His vanity or his zeal might be flattered 
by offers of tribute or professions of faith: but his losses, his fatigues, 
and the progress of an epidemical disease prevented a solid establish- 
ment; and the Saracens, after a campaign of fifteen months, retreated 
to the confines of Egypt, with the captives and the wealth of their 
African expedition. The caliph's fifth was granted to a favourite, on the 
nominal payment of five hundred thousand pieces of gold; 147 but the

state was doubly injured by this fallacious transaction, if each foot- 
soldier had shared one thousand, and each horseman three thousand 
pieces, in the real division of the plunder. The author of the death of 
Gregory was expected to have claimed the most precious reward of the 
victory: from his silence it might be presumed that he had fallen in 
the battle, till the tears and exclamations of the prefect's daughter at 
the sight of Zobeir revealed the valour and modesty of that gallant 
soldier. The unfortunate virgin was offered, and almost rejected, as a 
slave, by her father's murderer, who coolly declared that his sword was 
consecrated to the service of religion; and that he laboured for a recom- 
pense far above the charms of mortal beauty or the riches of this transi- 
tory life. A reward congenial to his temper was the honourable com- 
mission of announcing to the caliph Othman the success of his arms. 
The companions, the chiefs, and the people were assembled in the mosch 
of Medina, to hear the interesting narrative of Zobeir; and, as the orator 
forgot nothing except the merit of his own counsels and actions, the 
name of Abdallah was joined by the Arabians with the heroic names of 
Chaled and Amrou. 1 * 8 

The Western conquests of the Saracens were suspended near twenty 
years, till their dissensions were composed by the establishment of the 
house of Ommiyah; and the caliph Moawiyah was invited by the cries 
of the Africans themselves. The successors of Heraclius had been in- 
formed of the tribute which they had been compelled to stipulate with 
the Arabs; but instead of being moved to pity and relieve their distress, 
they imposed, as an equivalent or a fine, a second tribute of a similar 
amount. The ears of the Byzantine ministers were shut against the com- 
plaints of their poverty and ruin; their despair was reduced to prefer 
the dominion of a single master; and the extortions of the patriarch 
of Carthage, who was invested with civil and military power, provoked 
the sectaries, and even the Catholics, of the Roman province, to abjure 
the religion as well as the authority of their tyrants. The first lieutenant 
of Moawiyah acquired a just renown, subdued an important city, de- 
feated an army of thirty thousand Greeks, swept away fourscore thousand 
captives, and enriched with their spoils the bold adventurers of Syria 
and Egypt. 149 But the title of conqueror of Africa is more justly due to 
his successor Akbah. He marched from Damascus at the head of ten 
thousand of the bravest Arabs; and the genuine force of the Moslems 

report the same job. When the Arabs besieged the palace of Othman, it stood 
high in their catalogue of grievances.

"was enlarged by the doubtful aid and conversion of many thousand 
barbarians. It would be difficult, nor is it necessary, to trace the accurate 
line of the progress of Akbah. The interior regions have been peopled 
by the Orientals with fictitious armies and imaginary citadels. In the 
warlike province of Zab, or Numidia, fourscore thousand of the natives 
might assemble in arms; but the number of three hundred and sixty 
towns is incompatible with the ignorance or decay of husbandry; 160 
and a circumference of three leagues will not be justified by the ruins of 
Erbe or Lambesa, the ancient metropolis of that inland country. As we 
approach the sea-coast, the well-known cities of Bugia 151 and Tangier 1B2 
define the more certain limits of the Saracen victories. A remnant of 
tirade still adheres to the commodious harbour of Bugia, which in a more 
prosperous age is said to have contained about twenty thousand houses; 
and the plenty of iron which is dug from the adjacent mountains might 
have supplied a braver people with the instruments of defence. The 
remote position and venerable antiquity of Tingi, or Tangier, have been 
decorated by the Greek and Arabian fables; but the figurative expres- 
sions of the latter, that the walls were constructed of brass, and that 
the roofs were covered with gold and silver, may be interpreted as the 
emblems of strength and opulence. The province of Mauritania Tingi- 
ten'a, 158 which assumed the name of the capital, had been imperfectly 
discovered and settled by the Romans; the five colonies were confined 
to' a narrow pale, and the more southern parts were seldom explored 
except by the agents of luxury, who searched the forests for ivory and 
the citron-wood, 154 and the shores of the ocean for the purple shell-fish.

and Morocco, 156 and at length penetrated to the verge of the Atlantic 
and the great desert. The river Sus descends from the western sides of 
Mount Atlas, fertilises, like the Nile, the adjacent soil, and falls into 
the sea at a moderate distance from the Canary, or Fortunate, Islands, 
Its banks were inhabited by the last of the Moors, a race of savages, 
without laws or discipline or religion: they were astonished by the 
strange and irresistible terrors of the Oriental arms; and as they pos- 
sessed neither gold nor silver, the richest spoil was the beauty of the 
female captives, some of whom were afterwards sold for a thousand 
pieces of gold. The career, though not the zeal, of Akbah was checked 
by the prospect of a boundless ocean. He spurred his horse into the 
waves, and, raising his eyes to heaven, exclaimed with the tone of a 
fanatic, " Great God! if my course were not stopped by this sea, I 
would still go on, to the unknown kingdoms of the West, preaching 
the unity of thy holy name, and putting to the sword the rebellious 
nations who worship any other gods than thee." 15e Yet this Mohamme- 
dan Alexander, who sighed for new worlds, was unable to preserve hif 
recent conquests. By the universal defection of the Greeks and African* 
he was recalled from the shores of the Atlantic, and the surrounding 
multitudes left him only the resource of an honourable death. The last 
scene was dignified by an example of national virtue. An ambitious 
chief, who had disputed the command and failed in the attempt, wais 
led about as a prisoner in the camp of the Arabian general. The insur- 
gents had trusted to his discontent and revenge; he disdained their offers 
and revealed their designs. In the hour of danger the grateful Akbah 
unlocked his fetters and advised him to retire; he chose to die under 
the banner of his rival. Embracing as friends and martyrs, they un- 
sheathed their scimitars, broke their scabbards, and maintained an 
obstinate combat till they fell by each other's side on the last of their 
slaughtered countrymen. The third general or governor of Africaf Zuhear, 
avenged and encountered the fate of his predecessor. He vanquished 
the natives in many battles; he was overthrown by a powerful army 
which Constantinople had sent to the relief of Carthage. 

It had been the frequent practice of the Moorish tribes to join the 
invaders, to share the plunder, to profess the faith, and to revolt to 
their savage state of independence and idolatry on the first retreat or 
misfortune of the Moslems. The prudence of Akbah had proposed to

found an Arabian colony in the heart of Africa; a citadel that might 
curb the levity of the barbarians, a place of refuge to secure, against 
the accidents of war, the wealth and the families of the Saracens. With 
this view, and under the modest title of the station of a caravan, he 
planted this colony in the fiftieth year of the Hegira. In its present 
decay, Cairoan 15T still holds the second rank in the kingdom of Tunis, 
from which it is distant about fifty miles to the south: 158 its inland 
situation, twelve miles westward of the sea, has protected the city from 
the Greek and Sicilian fleets. When the wild beasts and serpents were 
extirpated, when the forest, or rather wilderness, was cleared, the vestiges 
of a Roman town were discovered in a sandy plain: the vegetable food 
of Cairoan is brought from afar; and the scarcity of springs constrains 
the inhabitants to collect in cisterns and reservoirs a precarious supply 
of rain-water. These obstacles were subdued by the industry of Akbah; 
he traced a circumference of three thousand and six hundred paces, 
which he encompassed with a brick wall; in the space of five years the 
governor's palace was surrounded with a sufficient number of private 
habitations; a spacious mosch was supported by five hundred columns 
of granite, porphyry, and Numidian marble; and Cairoan became the 
seat of learning as well as of empire. But these were the glories of a 
later age; the new colony was shaken by the successive defeats of 
Akbah and Zuheir, and the western expeditions were -again interrupted 
by the civil discord of the Arabian monarchy. The son of the valiant 
Zobeir maintained a war of twelve years, a siege of seven months, against 
the house of Ommiyah. Abdallah was said to unite the fierceness of the 
lion with the subtlety of the fox; but if he inherited the courage, he 
was devoid of the generosity, of his father. 150 

The return of domestic peace allowed the caliph Abdalmalek to re- 
sume the conquest of Africa; the standard was delivered to Hassan, 
governor of Egypt, and the revenue of that kingdom, with an army of 
.forty thousand men, was consecrated to the important service. In the 
vicissitudes of war, the interior provinces had been alternately won 
and lost by the Saracens. But the sea-coast still remained in the hands 

*" The foundation of Cairoan is mentioned by Ockley (Hist, of the Sara- 
cens, vol. ii. p. 129, 130); and the situation, mosch, etc., of the city are 
described by Leo Africanus (foL 75), Marmol (torn. ii. p. 532), and Shaw 
(p. 115). 

"*A portentous, though frequent, mistake has been the confounding, from 
a slight similitude of name, the Cyrene of the Greeks and the Cairoan of the 
Arabs, two cities which are separated by an interval of a thousand miles 
along the sea-coast. The great Thuanus has not escaped this fault, the less 
excusable as it is connected with a formal and elaborate description of Africa 
(Historian 1. vii. c. 2, in torn. i. p. 240, edit Buckley). 

"* Besides the Arabic chronicles of Abulfeda, Elmacin, and Abulpharagius, 
under the seventy-third year of the Hegira, we may consult D'Herbelot (Bib- 
lioth. Orient p. 7) and Ockley (Hist, of the Saracens, vol. ii. p. 339-349). 
The latter has given the last and pathetic dialogue between Abdallah and 
his mother, but he has forgot a physical effect of her grief for his death, 
the return, at the age of ninety, and fatal consequences of her menses.

of the Greeks; the predecessors of Hassan had respected the name and 
fortifications of Carthage; and the number of its defenders was recruited 
by the fugitives of Cabes and Tripoli. The arms of Hassan were bolder 
and more fortunate: he reduced and pillaged the metropolis of Africa; 
and the mention of scaling-ladders may justify the suspicion that he 
anticipated by a sudden assault the more tedious operations of a regular 
siege. But the joy of the conquerors was soon disturbed by the appear- 
ance of the Christian succours. The prefect and patrician John, a gen- 
eral of experience and renown, embarked at Constantinople the forces 
of the Eastern empire; 160 they were joined by the ships and soldiers of 
Sicily, and a powerful reinforcement of Goths 161 was obtained from the 
fears and religion of the Spanish monarch. The weight of the confed- 
erate navy broke the chain that guarded the entrance of the harbour; 
the Arabs retired to Cairoan, or Tripoli; the Christians landed; the 
citizens hailed the ensign of the cross, and the winter was idly wasted 
in the dream of victory or deliverance. But Africa was irrecoverably 
lost; the zeal and resentment of the commander of the faithful 162 pre- 
pared in the ensuing spring a more numerous armament by sea and 
land; and the patrician in his turn was compelled to evacuate the post 
and fortifications of Carthage. A second battle was fought in the neigh- 
bourhood of Utica: the Greeks and Goths were again defeated; and 
their timely embarkation saved them from the sword of Hassan, who 
had invested the slight and insufficient rampart of their camp. What- 
ever yet remained of Carthage was delivered to the flames, and the 
colony of Dido 1M and Caesar lay desolate above two hundred years, till

nicely ascertained the chronology by a strict comparison of the Arabic and 
Byzantine historians, who often disagree both in time and fact. See likewise

fact, though new, is so interesting and so probable, that I will accept it on 
the slightest authority. 

163 This commander is styled by Nicephorus BiwtXe&amp;s Sapa/nfcwy, a vague 
though not improper definition of the caliph. Theophanes introduces the 
strange appellation of n/wro&lt;n5/*oXos, which his interpreter Goar explains by 
Visir Asem. They may approach the truth, hi assigning the active part to 
the minister rather than the prince; but they forget that the Ommiades had 
only a kateb, or secretary, and that the office of Vizir was not revived or 
instituted till the I32nd year of the Hegira (D'Herbelot, p. 912).

a part, perhaps a twentieth, of the old circumference was repeopled 
by the first of the Fatimite caliphs. In the beginning of the sixteenth 
century the second capital of the West was represented by a mosch, a 
college without students, twenty-five or thirty shops, and the huts of 
five hundred peasants, who, in their abject poverty, displayed the arro- 
gance of the Punic senators. Even that paltry village was swept away 
by the Spaniards whom Charles the Fifth had stationed in the fortress 
of the Goletta. The ruins of Carthage have perished; and the place 
might be unknown if some broken arches of an aqueduct did not guide 
the footsteps of the inquisitive traveller. 164 

The Greeks were expelled, but the Arabians were not yet masters 
of the country. In the interior provinces the Moors or Berbers* so 
feeble under the first Caesars, so formidable to the Byzantine princes, 
maintained a disorderly resistance to the religion and power of the suc- 
cessors of Mohammed. Under the standard of their queen Cahina the 
independent tribes acquired some degree of union and discipline; and 
as the Moors respected in their females the character of a prophetess, 
they attacked the invaders with an enthusiasm similar to their own. 
The veteran bands of Hassan were inadequate to the defence of Africa: 
the conquests of an age were lost in a single day; and the Arabian chief, 
overwhelmed by 'the torrent, retired to the confines of Egypt, and ex- 
pected, five years, the promised succours of the caliph. After the retreat 
of the Saracens, the victorious prophetess assembled the Moorish chiefs, 
and recommended a measure of strange and savage policy. " Our cities," 
said she, " arid the gold and silver which .they contain, perpetually attract 
the arms of the Arabs. These vile metals are not the objects of ow 
ambition; we content ourselves with the simple productions of the earth.

188 The history of the word Barbar may be classed under four periods. 
i. In the time of Homer, when the Greeks and Asiatics might probably use 
a' common idiom, the imitative sound of Bar-bar was applied to the ruder 
tribes, whose pronunciation was most harsh, whose grammar was most de- 
fective. K&lt;p Ba#9a/*ty to m (Iliad, ii. 867, with the Oxford Scholiast Clarke's 
Annotation, and Henry Stephens's Greek Thesaurus, torn. i. p. 720). 2. From 
the time, at least, of Herodotus, it was extended to all the nations who were 
strangers to the language and manners of the Greeks. 3. In the age of 
Plautus, the Romans submitted to the insult (Pompeius Festus, L ii. p 48 
edit Dacier), and freely gave themselves the name of barbarians. They in- 
sensibly claimed an exemption for Italy and her subject provinces; and at 
length removed the disgraceful appellation to the savage or hostile nations 
beyond the- pale of the empire. 4. In every sense it was due to the Moors: 
the familiar word was borrowed from the Latin provincials by the Arabian 
conquerors, and has justly settled as a local denomination (Barbary) along 
the northern coast of Africa.

people." The proposal was accepted with unanimous applause. From 
Tangier to Tripoli the buildings, or at least the fortifications, were 
demolished, the fruit-trees were cut down, the means of subsistence were 
extirpated, a fertile and populous garden was changed into a desert, 
and the historians of a more recent period could discern the frequent 
traces of the prosperity and devastation of their ancestors. Such is the 
tale of the modern Arabians. Yet I strongly suspect that their ignorance 
of antiquity, the love of the marvellous, and the fashion of extolling the 
philosophy of barbarians, has induced them to describe, as one volunr 
tary act, the calamities of three hundred years since the first fury of 
the Donatists and Vandals. In the progress of the revolt Cahina had 
most probably contributed her share of destruction; and the alarm of 
universal ruin might terrify and alienate the cities that had reluctantly 
yielded to her unworthy yoke. They no longer hoped, perhaps they no 
longer wished, the return of their Byzantine sovereigns: their present 
servitude was not alleviated by the benefits of order and justice; and 
the most zealous Catholic must prefer the imperfect truths of the Koran 
to the blind and rude idolatry of the Moors. The general of the Saracens 
was again received as the saviour of the province: the friends of civil 
society conspired against the savages of the land; and the royal 
prophetess was slain in the first battle, which overturned the baseless 
fabric of her superstition and empire. The same spirit revived under 
the successor of Hassan: it was finally quelled by the activity of Musa 
and his two sons; but the number of the rebels may be presumed from 
that of three hundred thousand captives; Sixty thousand of whom, the 
caliph's fifth, were sold for the profit of the public treasury. Thirty 
thousand of the barbarian youth were enlisted in the troops; and the 
pious labours of Musa, to inculcate the knowledge and practice of the 
Koran, accustomed the Africans to obey the apostle of God and the 
commander of the faithful. In their climate and government, their diet 
and habitation, the wandering Moors resembled the Bedoweens of the 
desert. With the religion they were proud to adopt the language, name, 
and origin of Arabs: the blood of the strangers and natives was insensibly 
mingled; and from the Euphrates to the Atlantic the same nation might 
seem to be diffused over the sandy plains of Asia and Africa. Yet I 
will not deny that fifty thousand tents of pure Arabians might be 
transported over the Nile, and scattered through the Libyan desert; 
and I am not ignorant that five of the Moorish tribes still retain their 
barbarous idiom, with the appellation and character of white Africans. 1 * 6

and -the Saracens encountered each other on the confines of Europe and 
Africa. In the opinion of the latter, the difference of religion is a reason- 
able ground of enmity and warfare. 107 

As early as the time of Othman, 168 their piratical squadrons had 
ravaged the coast of Andalusia, 160 nor had they forgotten the relief 
of Carthage by the Gothic succours. In that age, as well as in the 
present, the kings of Spain were possessed of the fortress of Ceuta; one 
of the Columns of Hercules, which is divided by a narrow strait from 
the opposite pillar or point of Europe. A small portion of Mauritania 
was still wanting to the African conquest; but Musa, in the pride of 
victory, was. repulsed from the walls of Ceuta, by the vigilance and 
courage of Count Julian, the general of the Goths. From his disappoint- 
ment and perplexity Musa was relieved by an unexpected message of 
the Christian chief, who offered his place, his person, and his sword to 
the successors of Mohammed, and solicited the disgraceful honour of 
introducing their arms into the heart of Spain. 170 If we inquire into the 
cause of his treachery, the Spaniards will repeat the popular story of 
his daughter Cava; 1T1 of a virgin who was seduced, or ravished, by 
her sovereign; of a father who sacrificed his religion and country to the 
thirst of revenge. The passions of princes have often been licentious and 
destructive; but this well-known tale, romantic in itself, is indifferently 
supported by external evidence; ajid the history of Spain will suggest 
some motives of interest and policy more congenial to the breast of a

province, but to the whole peninsula of Spain (Geograph. Nub, p. 151 ; 
D'Herbelot, Biblioth. Orient, p. 114, 115). The etymology has been most 
improbably deduced from Vandalusia, country of the Vandals (D'Anville, 
Etats de TEurope, p. 146, 147, etc.). But the Handalusia of Casiri, which 
signifies, in Arabic^ the region of the evening, of the West, in a word, the 
Hesperia of the Greeks, is perfectly apposite (Biblioth. Arabico-Hispana,

* ro The fall and resurrection of the Gothic monarchy are related by Mariana 
(om. i. p. 238-260; 1. vi, c. 19-26; L vii. c. i, 2). That historian has infused 
into his noble work (Historiae de Rebus Hispaniae, libri xxx.; Hagae Com- 
itum, 1733, in four volumes in folio, with the Continuation of Miniana) the 
style and spirit of a Roman classic; and, after the twelfth century, his knowl- 
edge and judgment may be safely trusted. But the Jesuit is not exempt from 
the prejudices of his order; he adopts and adonis, like his rival Buchanan, 
the most absurd of the national legends; he is too careless of criticism and 
chronology, and supplies, from a lively fancy, the chasms of historical evi- 
dence. These chasms are large and frequent; Roderic, archbishop of Toledo, 
the father of the Spanish history, lived five hundred years after the conquest 
of the Arabs; and the more early accounts are comprised in some meagre 
lines of the blind chronicles of Isidore of Badajoz (Pacensis) and of Al- 
phonso III. king of Leon, which I have seen only in the annals of Pagi.

veteran statesman. 172 After the decease or deposition of Witiza, his two 
sons were supplanted by the ambition of Roderic, a noble Goth, 
whose father, the duke or governor of a province, had fallen a victim 
to the preceding tyranny. The monarchy was still elective; but the sons 
of ^ Witiza, educated on the steps of the throne, were impatient of a 
private station. Their resentment was the more dangerous, as it was 
varnished with the dissimulation of courts; their followers were excited 
by the remembrance of favours and the promise of a revolution; and 
their uncle Oppas, archbishop of Toledo and Seville, was the first person 
in the church, and the second in the state. It is probable that Julian 
was involved in the disgrace of the unsuccessful faction; that he had 
little to hope and much to fear from the new reign; and that the impru- 
dent king could not forget or forgive the injuries which Roderic and his 
family had sustained. The merit and influence of the count rendered 
him a useful or formidable subject; his estates were ample, his followers 
bold and numerous ; and it was too fatally shown that, by his Andalusian 
and Mauritanian commands, he held in his hand the keys of the Spanish 
monarchy. Too feeble, however, to meet his sovereign in arms, he 
sought the aid of a foreign power; and his rash invitation of the Moors 
and Arabs produced the calamities of eight hundred years. In his epistles, 
or in a personal interview, he revealed the wealth and nakedness of his 
country; the weakness of an unpopular prince; the degeneracy of an 
effeminate people. The Goths were no longer the victorious barbarians, 
who had humbled the pride of Rome, despoiled the queen of nations, 
and penetrated from the Danube to the Atlantic Ocean. Secluded from" 
the world by the Pyrenaean mountains, the successors of Alaric had 
slumbered in a long peace: the walls of the cities were mouldered into 
dust: the youth had abandoned the exercise of arms; and the presump- 
tion of their ancient renown would expose them in a field of battle to 
the first assault of the invaders. The ambitious Saracen was fired by 
the ease and importance of the attempt; but the execution was delayed 
till he had consulted the commander of the faithful; and his messenger 
returned with the permission of Walid to annex the unknown kingdoms 
of the West to the religion and throne of the caliphs. In his residence of 
Tangier, Musa, with secrecy and caution, continued his correspondence 
and hastened his preparations. But the remorse of the conspirators was 
soothed by the fallacious assurance that he should content himself with 
the glory and spoil, without aspiring to establish the Moslems beyond 
the sea that separates Africa from Europe. 178 

178 In the story of Cava, Mariana (1. vi. c. 21, p. 241, 242) seems to vie with 
the Lucretia of Livy. Like the ancients, he seldom quotes; and the oldest 
testimony of Barpnius (Annal. Eccles. A.D. 713, No. 19), that of Lucas 
Tudensis, a Gallician deacon of the thirteenth century, only says, Cava quam 
pro concubina utebatur.

J 94 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

Before Musa would trust an army of the faithful to the traitors and 
infidels of a foreign land, he made a less dangerous trial of their strength 
and veracity. One hundred Arabs, and four hundred Africans, passed 
over, in four vessels, from Tangier or Ceuta: the place of their descent 
on the opposite shore of the strait is marked by the name of Tarif their 
chief; and the date of this memorable event 1T4 is fixed to the month 
of Ramadan, of the ninety-first year of the Hegira, to the month of 
July, seven hundred and forty-eight years from the Spanish era of 
Caesar," 5 seven hundred and ten after the birth of Christ. From their 
first station, they marched eighteen miles through a hilly country to the 
fcastle and town of Julian; 170 on which (it is still called Algezire) they 
bestowed the name of the Green Island, from a verdant cape that ad- 
vances into th6 sea. Their hospitable entertainment, the Christians who 
joined their standard, their inroad into a fertile and unguarded province, 
the richness of their spoil, and the safety of their return^ announced to 
their brethren the most favourable omens of victory. In the ensuing 
spring five thousand veterans atnd volunteers were embarked under the 
command of Tank, a dauntless and skilful soldier, who surpassed the 
expectation of his chief; and the necessary transports were provided by 
the industry of their too faithful ally. The Saracens landed m at the 

Cardonne (Hist de 1'Af rique et de 1'Espagne sous la Domination des Arabes, 
Paris, 1765, 3 yols. in I2mo, tofti. i. p. S5-H4), and more concisely by M. de 
Guignes (Hist des Huns, torn. i. p. 347-350). The librarian of the Escurial 
lias not satisfied my hopes: yet he appears to have searched with diligence his 
broken materials; and the history of the conquest is illustrated by some vatr 
uable fragments of the, genuine Razis (who wrote at Corduba, A.H. 300) of 
Ben Hazil, etc. See Biblioth. Afabico-Hispana, torn. ii. p. 32, 105, 106, 182, 
252, 3*9-332. On this occasion the industry of Pagi has been aided by the 
Arabic learning o* his friend the Abbe* de Longuerue, and to their joint 
labours I^am deeply indebted. 

1M A mistake of Roderic of Toledo, in comparing the lunar years of the 
Hegira with the Julian years of the Era, has determined Baronius, Mariana, 
&amp;na the crowd of Spanish historians to place the first invasion in the year 713, 
*nd the battle of Xeres in November, 714. This anachronism of three years 
lias been detected by the more correct industry of modern chronologists, above 
all, of Pagi (Critica, torn. iii. p. 169, 171-174), who have restored the genuine 
date of the revolution. At the present time an Arabian scholar, like Cardonne, 
who adopts the ancient error (torn. i. p. 75), is inexcusably ignorant or 
careless. 

17 "The Era of Caesar, which in Spain was in legal and popular use till the 
fourteenth century^ begins thirty-eight years before the birth of Christ. I 
would refer the origin to the general peace by sea and knd, which confirmed 
the power and partition of the Triumvirs (Dion Cassius, 1. xlviii. p. 547, 553 
[c. 28 and 36]. Appian de Bell. Civil. 1. v. [c. 72] p. 1034, edit. fol.). Spain 
was a province of Caesar Octavian; and Tarragona, which raised the first 
temple to Augustus (Tacit Annal. i. 78), might borrow from the Orientals 
this mode of flattery. 

176 The road, the country, the old castle of Count Julian, and the super- 
stitious belief of the Spaniards of hidden treasures, etc., are described by 
Pere Labat (Voyages en Espagne et en Italic, torn. i. p. 207-217) with his 
usual pleasantry. 

171 The Nubian Geographer (p. 154) explains the topography of the war; but

pillar or point of Europe; the corrupt and familiar appellation of Gibral- 
tar (Gebelal Tarik) describes the mountain of Tarik; and the entrench- 
ments of his camp were the first outline of those fortifications which, in 
the hands of our countrymen, have resisted the art and power of the 
house of Bourbon. The adjacent governors informed the court of Toledo 
of the descent and progress of the Arabs; and the defeat of his lieutenant 
Edeco, who had been commanded to seize and bind the presumptuous 
strangers, admonished Roderic of the magnitude of the danger. At the 
royal summons, the dukes and counts, the bishops and nobles of th* 
Gothic monarchy, assembled at the head of their followers; and the title 
of King of the Romans, which is employed by an Arabic historian, may 
be excused by the close affinity of language, religion, and manners, be- 
tween the nations of Spain. His army consisted of ninety or a hundred 
thousand men; a formidable power, if their fidelity and discipline had 
been adequate to their numbers. The troops of Tarik had been aug- 
mented to twelve thousand Saracens; but the Christian malcontents were 
attracted by the influence of Julian, and a crowd of Africans most 
greedily tasted the temporal blessings of the Koran. In the neighbour- 
hood of Cadiz, the town of Xeres 17S has been illustrated by the en- 
counter which determined the fate of the kingdom; the stream of the 
Guadalete, which falls into the bay, divided the two camps, and marked 
the advancing and retreating skirmishes of three successive and bloody 
days. On the fourth day the two armies joined a more serious and 
decisive issue; but Alaric would -have blushed at the sight of his UB* 
worthy successor, sustainijig on his head a diadem of pearls, encumbered 
with a flowing robe of gold and silken embroidery, and reclining on a 
litter or car of ivory drawn by two white mules, Notwithstanding the 
valour of the Saracens, they fainted under the weight of multitudes, 
and the plain of Xeres was overspread with sixteen thoijisand .of -their 
dead bodies. " My brethren," said Tarik to his surviving companions, 
"the enemy is before you, the sea is behind; whither would ye fly? 
Follow your general: I am resolved either to lose my life or to trample 
on the prostrate king of the Romans." Besides the resource of despair, 
he confided in the secret correspondence and nocturnal interviews of 
Count Julian with the sons and. the brother of Witiza. The two princes 
and the archbishop of Toledo occupied the most important potst: 
their well-timed defection broke the ranks of the Christians; each 
warrior was prompted by f eax . or suspicion to -consult his persotnal 
safety; and the remains of the Gothic army were scattered or destroyed 
in the flight and pursuit of the three following days. Amidst the general 

it is highly incredible that the lieutenant of Musa should execute the desperate 
and useless measure of burning his ships. 

XT8 Xeres (the Roman colony of Asta Regia) is only two leagues from Cadiz. 
In the sixteenth century it was a granary of corn; and the wine of Xeres is 
familiar to the nations of Europe (Lud. Nonii Hispania, c. 13, p. 54-36, a 
work of correct and concise knowledge; D'Anville, Etats de I'Europe, etc- 
P- 154). 



I 9 6 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

disorder Roderic started from his car, and mounted Orelia, the fleetest 
of his horses; but he escaped from a soldier's death to perish more 
ignobly in the waters of the Baetis or Guadalquivir. His diadem, his 
robes, and his courser were found on the bank; but as the body of the 
Gothic prince was lost in the waves, the pride and ignorance of the 
caliph must have been gratified with some meaner head, which was ex- 
posed in triumph before the palace of Damascus. "And such,- 3 ' con- 
tinues a valiant historian of the Arabs, " is the fate of those kings who 
withdraw themselves from a field of battle." 179 

Count Julian had plunged so deep into guilt and infamy, that 
his only hope was in the ruin of his country. After the battle of Xeres 
he recommended the most effectual measures to the victorious Sara- 
cen. " The king of the Goths is slain; their princes have fled before 
you, the army is routed, the nation is astonished. Secure with suffi- 
cient detachments the cities of Baetica; but in person, and without de- 
lay, march to the royal city of Toledo, and allow not the distracted 
Christians either time or tranquillity for the election of a new mon- 
arch." Tarik listened to his advice. A Roman captive and proselyte, 
who had been enfranchised by the caliph himself, assaulted Cordova 
with seven hundred horse: he swam the river, surprised the town, and 
drove the Christians into the great church, where they defended them- 
selves above three months. Another detachment reduced the sea-coast 
of Baetica, which in the last period of the Moorish power has comprised 
in a narrow space the populous kingdom of Granada. The march of 
Tarik from the Baetis to the Tagus 18 was directed through the Sierra 
Morena, that separates Andalusia and Castille, till he appeared in 
arms under the walls of Toledo. 181 The most zealous of the Catholics 
had escaped with the relics of their saints; and if the gates were shut, 
it was only till the victor had subscribed a fair and reasonable capitula- 
tion. The voluntary exiles were allowed to depart with their effects; 
seven churches were appropriated to the Christian worship; the arch- 
bifihop and his clergy were at liberty to exercise their functions, the 
monks to practise or neglect their penance; and the Goths and Romans 

"* Id sane inf ortunii regibus pedem ex acie ref erentibus saepe contingit Ben 
Hazil of Granada, in Biblioth. Arabico-Hispana, torn. ii. p. 327. Some cred- 
ulous Spaniards believe that king Roderic, or Rodrigo, escaped to a' hermit's 
cell; and others, that he was cast alive into a tub full of serpents, from 
whence he exclaimed, with a lamentable voice, "They devour the part with 
which I have so grievously sinned." (Don Quixote,, part ii. 1. iii. c. i.) 

180 The direct road from Corduba to Toledo was measured by Mr. Swin- 
burne's mules in 72% hours; but a larger computation must be adopted for 
the slow and devious marches of an army. The Arabs traversed the province 
of La Mancha, which the pen of Cervantes has transformed into classic 
ground to the readers of every nation. 

M The antiquities of Toledo, Urbs^ Parva in the Punic wars, Urbs Regia in 
4h* sixth century, are briefly described by Nonius (Hispania, c. 59, p. 181- 
186). He borrows from Roderic the fatale palatium of Moorish portraits, 
but modestly insinuates that it was no more than a Roman amphitheatre. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 197 

were left in all civil and criminal cases to the subordinate jurisdiction 
of their own laws and magistrates. But if the justice of Tarik pro- 
tected the Christians, his gratitude and policy rewarded the Jews, to 
whose secret or open aid he was indebted for his most important acqui- 
sitions. Persecuted by the kings and synods of Spain, who had often 
pressed the alternative of banishment or baptism, that outcast nation 
embraced the moment of revenge: the comparison of their past and 
present state was the pledge of their fidelity; and the alliance between 
the disciples of Moses and of Mohammed was maintained till the final era 
of their common expulsion. From the royal seat of Toledo, the Arabian 
leader spread his conquests to the north, over the modern realms of 
Castille and Leon: but it is needless to enumerate the cities that yielded 
on his approach, or again to describe the table of emerald, 182 trans- 
ported from the East by the Romans, acquired by the Goths among 
the spoils of Rome, and presented by the Arabs to the throne of Da- 
mascus. Beyond the Asturian mountains, the maritime town of Gijon 
was the term 188 of the lieutenant of Musa, who had performed, with 
the speed of a traveller, his victorious march, of seven hundred miles, 
from the rock of Gibraltar to the Bay of Biscay. The failure of land 
compelled him to retreat; and he was recalled to Toledo, to excuse his 
presumption of subduing a kingdom in the absence of his general. Spain, 
which, in a more savage and disorderly state, had resisted, two hundred 
years, the arms of the Romans, was overrun in a few months by those 
of the Saracens; and such was the eagerness of submission and treaty, 
that the governor of Cordova is recorded as the only chief who fell, with- 
out conditions, a prisoner into their hands. The cause of the Goths 
had been irrevocably judged in the field of Xeres; and, in the national 
dismay, each part of the monarchy declined a contest with the antag- 
onist who had vanquished the united strength of the whole. 184 That 
strength had been wasted by two successive seasons of famine and pes- 
tilence; and the governors, who were impatient to surrender, might 

381 In the Historia Arabum (c. 9, p. 17, ad calcem Elmacin), Roderic of 
Toledo describes the emerald tables, and inserts the name of Medina! AI- 
meyda, in Arabic words and letters. He appears to be conversant with the 
Mohammedan writers; but I cannot agree with M. de Guignes (Hist des 
Huns, torn. i. p. 350), that he had read and transcribed Novairi; because he 
was dead a hundred years before Novairi composed his history. This mis- 
take is founded on a still grosser error. M. de Guignes confounds the his- 
torian Roderic Ximenes archbishop of Toledo in the thirteenth century, with 
Cardinal Ximenes who governed Spain in the beginning of the sixteenth, and 
was the subject, not the author, of historical compositions. 

188 Tarik might have inscribed on the last rock the boast of Regnard and 
his companions in their Lapland journey: 

" Hie tandem stetimus, nobis ubi defuit orbis/' 

^Such was the argument of the traitor Oppas, and every chief to whom 
it was addressed did not answer with the spirit of Pelagius: Omnis Hispania 
dudum sub uno regimine Gothorum, omnis exercitus Hispaniae in uno con- 
gregatus Ismaelitarum non valuit sustinere impetum. Chron. Alphonsi Regis* 
apud Pagi&gt; torn. iii. p. 177. 



198 THE DECLINE AND FALL. OF 

exaggerate the difficulty of collecting the provisions of a siege. To dis- 
arm the Christians, superstition likewise contributed her terrors: and 
the subtle Arab encouraged the report of dreams, omens, and prophe- 
cies, and of the portraits of the destined conquerors of Spain, that were 
discovered on breaking open an apartment of the royal palace. Yet a 
spark of the vital flame was still alive: some invincible fugitives pre- 
ferred a life of poverty and freedom in the Asturian valleys; the hardy 
mountaineers repulsed the slaves of the caliph; and the sword of Pela- 
gius has been transformed into the sceptre of the Catholic kings. 185 

On the intelligence of this rapid success;, the applause of Musa de- 
generated into envy, and he began, not to complain, but to fear, that 
Tank would leave him nothing to subdue. At the head of ten thousand 
Arabs and eight thousand Africans, he passed over in person from 
Mauritania to Spain: the first of his companions were the noblest of 
the Koreish; his eldest son was left in the command of Africa; the 
three younger brethren were of an age and spirit to second the boldest 
enterprises of their father. At his landing in Algezire he was respect- 
fully entertained by Count Julian, who stifled his inward remorse, and 
testified, both in words and actions, that the victory of the Arabs had 
not impaired his attachment to their cause. Some enemies yet re- 
mained for the sword of Musa. The tardy repentance of the Goths 
had compared their own numbers and those of the invaders; the cities 
from which the march of Tarik had declined considered themselves as 
impregnable; and the bravest patriots defended the fortifications of 
Seville and Merida. They were successively besieged and reduced by 
the labour of. Musa, who transported his camp from the Baetis to the 
Anas, from the Guadalquivir to the Guadiana. When he beheld the 
works of Roman magnificence, the bridge, the aqueducts, the triumphal 
arches, and the theatre of the ancient metropolis of Lusitania, " I should 
imagine," said he to his four companions, " that the human race must 
have united their art and power in the foundation of this city: happy 
is the man who shall become its master 1 " He aspired to that happi- 
ness, but the Emeritus sustained on this occasion the honour of their 
descent' from the veteran legionaries of Augustus. 186 Disdaining the 
confinement of their walls, they gave battle to the Arabs on the plain; 
but an ambuscade rising from the shelter of a quarry, or a ruin, chas- 
tised their indiscretion, and intercepted their return. The wooden tur- 
rets of assault were rolled forwards to the foot of the rampart; but the 
defence of Merida was obstinate and long; and the castle of the martyrs

p. 720) were planted in this metropolis of Lusitania, perhaps of Spain (sub- 
mittit cui tota sues Hispania fasces). Nonius (Hispania, c. 31, p. 106-110)

was a perpetual testimony of the losses of the Moslems. The constancy 
of the besieged was at length subdued by famine and despair; and the 
prudent victor disguised his impatience under the names of clemency 
and esteem! The alternative of exile or tribute was allowed; the 
churches were divided between the two religions; and the wealth of 
those who had fallen in the siege, or retired to Gallicia, was confiscated 
as the reward of the faithful. In the midway between Merida and 
Toledo, the lieutenant of Musa saluted the vicegerent of the caliph, 
and conducted him to the palace of the Gothic kings. Their first inter- 
view was cold and formal; a rigid account was exacted of the treasures 
of Spain: the character of Tarik was exposed to suspicion and obloquy; 
and the hero was imprisoned, reviled, and ignominiously scourged by the 
hand, or the command, of Musa. Yet so strict was the discipline, so 
pure the zeal, or so tame the spirit, of the primitive Moslems, that after 
this public indignity Tarik could serve and be trusted in the reduction 
of the Tarragonese province. A mosch was erected at Saragossa by 
the liberality of the Koreish: the port of Barcelona was opened to the 
vessels of Syria; and the Goths were pursued beyond the Pyrenean 
mountains into their Gallic province of Septimania or Languedoc. 187 
In the church of St. Mary, at Carcassonne, Musa found, but it is im- 
probable that he left, seven equestrian statues of massy silver; and 
from his term or column of Narbonne, he returned on his footsteps to 
the Gallician and Lusitanian shores of the ocean. During the absence 
of the father, his son Abdelaaz chastised the insurgents of Seville, and 
reduced, from Malaga to Valentia, the sea-coast of the Mediterranean: 
his original treaty with the discreet and valiant Theodemir 18S will rep- 
resent the manners and policy of the times. u The conditions of peace 
agreed and sworn between Abdelaziz, the son of Musa, the son of Nas- 
sir, and Theodemir prince of the Goths. In the name of the most mer- 
ciful God, Abdelaziz makes peace on these conditions: that Theodemir 
shall not be disturbed in his principality, nor any injury be offered to 
the life or property, the wives and children, the religion and temples, 
of the Christians; that Theodemir shall freely deliver his seven cities, 
Orihuda, Valentola, Alicant, Mola, Vacasora, Bigerra (now Bejar),

p. 349) and Cardonne (Hist de 1'Afrique et de 1'Espagne, torn. i. p. 93, 94, 
104, 105), lead Musa into the Narbonnese Gaul. But I find no mention of 
this enterprise, either in Roderic of Toledo, or the MSS. of the Escurial, and 
the invasion of the Saracens is postponed by a French chronicle till tie ninth

present decay of Spanish agriculture Mr. Swinburne (Travels into Spain,

each of their vassals shall be taxed at one moiety of the said imposition. 
Given the fourth of Regeb, in the year of the Hegira ninety-four, and 
subscribed with the names of four Musulman witnesses." 189 Theo- 
demir and his subjects were treated with uncommon lenity; but the 
rate of tribute appears to have fluctuated from a tenth to a fifth, ac- 
cording to the submission or obstinacy of the Christians. 190 In this 
revolution many partial calamities were inflicted by the carnal or re- 
ligious passions of the enthusiasts: some churches were profaned by the 
new worship: some relics or images were confounded with idols: the 
rebels were put to the sword, and one town (an obscure place between 
Cordova and Seville) was razed to its foundations. Yet if we compare 
the invasion of Spain by the Goths, or its recovery by the kings of Cas- 
tille and Arragon, we must applaud the moderation and discipline of 
the Arabian conquerors. 

The exploits of Musa were performed in the evening of life, though 
he affected to disguise his age by colouring with a red powder the white- 
ness of his beard. But in the love of action and glory his breast was 
still fired with the ardour of youth; and the possession of Spain was 
considered only as the first step to the monarchy of Europe. With a 
powerful armament by sea and land he was preparing to repass the 
Pyrenees, to extinguish in Gaul and Italy the declining kingdoms of the 
Franks and Lombards, and to preach the unity of God on the altar of 
the Vatican. From thence, subduing the barbarians of Germany, he 
proposed to follow the course of the Danube from its source to the 
Euxine Sea, to overthrow the Greek or Roman empire of Constantinople, 
and, returning from Europe to Asia, to unite his new acquisitions with 
Antioch and the provinces of Syria. 181 But his vast enterprise, perhaps 

180 See the treaty in Arabic and Latin, in the Bibliotheca Arabico-Hispana, 
torn. ii. p. 105, 106. It is signed the 4th of the month of Regeb, A.H. 94, the 
5th of April, A.D. 713; a date which seems to prolong the resistance of Theod- 
emir, and the government of Musa. 

309 From the history of Sandoval, p. 87. Fleury (Hist Eccles. torn. ix. 
p. 261) has given the substance of another treaty concluded A.JE.C. 782, A.D. 734, 
between an Arabian chief and the Goths and Romans, of the territory of 
Coimbra in Portugal. The tax of the churches is fixed at twenty-five pounds 
of gold; of the monasteries, fifty; of the cathedrals, one hundred: the Chris- 
tians are judged by their count, but in capital cases he must consult the 
alcaide. The church doors must be shut, and they must respect the name of 
Mohammed. I have not the original before me; it would confirm or destroy 
a dark suspicion that the piece has been forged to introduce the immunity of 
a neighbouring convent. 

191 This design, which is attested by several Arabian historians (Cardonne, 
torn. i. p. 95, 96), may be compared with that of Mithridates, to march from 
the Crimea to Rome; or with that of Caesar, to conquer the East and return 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE sot 

of easy execution, must have seemed extravagant to vulgar minds; and 
the visionary conqueror was soon reminded of his dependence and servi- 
tude. The friends of Tarik had effectually stated his services and 
wrongs: at the court of Damascus the proceedings of Musa were blamed, 
his intentions were suspected, and his delay in complying with the first 
invitation was chastised by a harsher and more peremptory summons. 
An intrepid messenger of the caliph entered his camp at Lugo in Galli- 
cia, and in the presence of the Saracens and Christians arrested the 
bridle of his horse. His own loyalty, or that of his troops, inculcated 
the duty of obedience: and his disgrace was alleviated by the recall of 
his rival, and the permission of investing with his two governments his 
two sons, Abdallah and Abdelaziz. His long triumph from Ceuta to 
Damascus displayed the spoils of Africa and the treasures of Spain: four 
hundred Gothic nobles, with gold coronets and girdles, were distin- 
guished in his train; and the number of male and female captives, se- 
lected for their birth or beauty, was computed at eighteen, or even at 
thirty, thousand persons. As soon as he reached Tiberias in Palestine, 
he was apprised of the sickness and danger of the caliph, by a private 
message from Soliman, his brother and presumptive heir, who wished 
to reserve for his own reign the spectacle of victory. Had Walid recov- 
ered, the delay of Musa would have been criminal: he pursued his 
inarch, and found an enemy on the throne. In his trial before a par- 
tial judge, against a popular antagonist, he was convicted of vanity and 
falsehood; and a fine of two hundred thousand pieces of gold either 
exhausted his poverty or proved his rapaciousness. The unworthy 
treatment of Tarik was revenged by a similar indignity; and the veteran 
commander, after a public whipping, stood a whole day in the sun be- 
fore the palace gate, till he obtained a decent exile, under the pious 
name of a pilgrimage to Mecca. The resentment of the caliph might 
have been satiated with the ruin of Musa; but his fears demanded the 
extirpation of a potent and injured family. A sentence of death was 
intimated with secrecy and speed to the trusty servants of the throne 
both in Africa and Spain; and the forms, if not the substance, of jus- 
tice were superseded in this bloody execution. In the mosch or palace 
of Cordova, Abdelaziz was slain by the swords of the conspirators; 
they accused their governor of claiming the honours of royalty; and 
his scandalous marriage with Egilona, the widow of Roderic, offended 
the prejudices both of the Christians and Moslems. By a refinement 
of cruelty, the head of the son was presented to the father, with an 
insulting question, whether he acknowledged the features of the rebel? 
" I know his features," he exclaimed with indignation: " I assert his 
innocence; and I imprecate the same, a juster fate, against the authors 
of his death." The age and despair of Musa raised him above the 
power of kings; and he expired at Mecca of the anguish of a broken 

home by the North ; and all three are perhaps surpassed by the real and suc- 
cessful enterprise of Hannibal

heart. His rival was more favourably treated: his services were for- 
given; and Tank was permitted to mingle with the crowd of slaves. 19 * 
I am ignorant whether Count Julian was rewarded with the death which 
he deserved indeed, though not from the hands of the Saracens; but 
the tale of their ingratitude to the sons of Witiza is disproved by the 
most unquestionable evidence. The two royal youths were reinstated 
in the private patrimony of their father; but on the decease of Eba, 
the elder, his daughter was unjustly despoiled of her portion by the 
violence of her unde Sigebut. The Gothic maid pleaded her cause 
before the caliph Hashem, and obtained the restitution of her inherit- 
ance; but she was given in marriage to a noble Arabian, and their two 
sons, Isaac and Ibrahim, were received in Spain with the consideration 
fiat was due to their origin and riches. 

A province is assimilated to the victorious state by the introduction 
of strangers and the imitative spirit of the natives; and Spain, which 
had been successively tinctured with Punic, and Roman, and Gothic 
blood, imbibed, in a few generations, the name and manners of the 
Arabs. The first conquerors, and the twenty successive lieutenants of 
the caliphs, were attended by a numerous train of civil and military 
followers, who preferred a distant fortune to a narrow home: the pri- 
vate and public interest was promoted by the establishment of faithful 
colonies; and the cities of Spain were proud to commemorate the tribe 
or country of their Eastern progenitors. The victorious though motley 
bands of Tarik and Musa asserted, by the name of Spaniards, their 
original daim of conquest; yet they allowed their brethren of Egypt 
to share their establishments of Murcia and Lisbon. The royal legion 
of Damascus was planted at Cordova; that of Emesa at Seville; that of 
Kinnisrin or Chalcis at Jaen; that of Palestine at Algezire and Medina 
Sidonia. The natives of Yemen and Persia were scattered round Toledo 
and the inland country, and the fertile seats of Granada were bestowed 
on ten thousand horsemen of Syria and Irak, the children of the purest 
and most noble of the Arabian tribes. 198 A spirit of emulation, some- 
times beneficial, -more frequently dangerous, was nourished by these 

*"! much regret pur loss, or my ignorance, of two Arabic works of the 
eighth century, a Life of Musa, and a Poem on the exploits of Tarik. Of 
these authentic pieces, the former was composed by a grandson, of Musa, who 
had escaped from the massacre of his kindred ; the latter by the Vizir of the 
first Abdalrahman, caliph of Spain, who might have conversed with some of 
the veterans of the conqueror (Bibjioth. Arabico-Hispana, torn. ii. p. 36, 139). 

^Biblioth. Arab.-Hispana, torn. ii. p. 32, 252. The former of these quota- 
tions is taken from a Biographic Hispanica, by an Arabian of Valencia (see 
the copious Extracts of Casiri, torn. ii. p. 30-121) ; and the latter from a 
general Chronology of the Caliphs, and of the African and Spanish Dynasties, 
with a particular History of the kingdom of Granada, of which Casiri has 
given almost an entire version (Biblioth. Arabico-Hispana, torn. ii. p. 177-319).

hereditary factions. Ten years after the conquest, a map of the prov- 
ince was presented to the caliph: the seas, the rivers, and the harbours, 
the inhabitants and cities, the climate, the soil, and the mineral pro- 
ductions of the earth. 194 In the space of two centuries the gifts of 
nature were improved by the agriculture, 105 the manufactures, and the 
commerce of an industrious people; and the effects of their -diligence 
have been magnified by the idleness of their fancy. The first of the 
Ommiades who reigned in Spain solicited the support of the Christians; 
and in his edict of peace and protection, he contents himself with a 
modest imposition of ten thousand ounces of gold, ten thousand pounds 
of silver, ten thousand horses, as many mules, one thousand cuirasses, 
with an equal number of helmets and lances. 196 The most powerful 
of his successors derived from the same kingdom the annual tribute of 
twelve millions and forty-five thousands dinars or pieces of gold, about 
six millions of sterling money; 197 a sum which, in the tenth century, 
most probably surpassed the united revenues of the Christian monarchs. 
His royal seat of Cordova contained six hundred moschs, nine hundred 
baths, and two hundred thousand houses; he gave laws to eighty cities 
of the first, to three hundred of the second and third order; and the 
fertile banks of the Guadalquivir were adorned with twelve thousand 
villages and hamlets. The Arabs might exaggerate the truth, but they 
created, and they describe, the most prosperous era of the riches, the 
cultivation, and the populousness of Spain. 198

ince, but of a line of castles independent of the Moorish yoke (D'Anville, 
Etats de 1'Europe, p. 166-170). Had Casiri been a critic, he would have

204 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

The wars of the Moslems were sanctified by the prophet; but among 
the various precepts and examples of his life, the caliphs selected the 
lessons of toleration that might tend to disarm the resistance of the 
unbelievers. Arabia was the temple and patrimony of the God of 
Mohammed; but he beheld with less jealousy and affection the nations 
of the earth. The polytheists and idolaters, who were ignorant of his 
name, might be lawfully extirpated by his votaries; 199 but a wise policy 
supplied the obligation of justice; and after some acts of intolerant 
zeal, the Mohammedan conquerors of Hindostan have spared the 
pagodas of that devout and populous country. The disciples of Abra- 
ham, of Moses, and of Jesus were solemnly invited to accept the more 
perfect revelation of Mohammed; but if they preferred the payment of 
a moderate tribute, they were entitled to the freedom of conscience and 
religious worship. 200 In a field of battle, the forfeit lives of the pris- 
oners were redeemed by the profession of IslaM; the females were 
bound to embrace the religion of their masters, and a race of sincere 
proselytes was gradually multiplied by the education of the infant cap- 
tives. But the millions of African and Asiastic converts, who swelled 
the native band of the faithful Arabs, must have been allured, rather 
than constrained, to declare their belief in one God and the apostle of 
God. By the repetition of a sentence and the loss of a foreskin, the 
subject or the slave, the captive or the criminal, arose in a moment the 
free and equal companion of the victorious Moslems. Every sin was 
expiated, every engagement was dissolved: the vow of celibacy was 
superseded by the indulgence of nature; the active spirits who slept in 
the cloister were awakened by the trumpets of the Saracens; and in the 
convulsion of the world, every member of a new society ascended to the 
natural level of his capacity and courage. The minds of the multitude 
were tempted by the invisible as well as temporal blessings of the 
Arabian prophet; and charity will hope that many of his proselytes 
entertained a serious conviction of the truth and sanctity of his reve- 
lation. In the eyes of an inquisitive polytheist, it must appear worthy 
of the human and the divine nature. More pure than the system of 
Zoroaster, more liberal than the law of Moses, the religion of Moham- 
med might seem less inconsistent with reason than the creed of mystery 

a fire consumed the greatest part of the Escurial library, rich in the spoils of 
Granada and Morocco.

besides God, worship the sun, moon, or idols. 2. Atheists. Utrique, quamdiu

and superstition which, in the seventh century, disgraced the simplicity 
of the Gospel. 

In the extensive provinces of Persia and Africa, the national religion 
has been eradicated by the Mohammedan faith. The ambiguous the- 
ology of the Magi stood alone among the sects of the East: but the 
profane writings of Zoroaster 201 might, under the reverend name of 
Abraham, be dexterously connected with the chain of divine revelation. 
Their evil principle, the demon Ahriman, might be represented as the 
rival, or as the creature, of the God of light. The temples of Persia 
were devoid of images; but the worship of the sun and of fire might 
be stigmatised as a gross and criminal idolatry. 202 Hie milder senti- 
ment was consecrated by the practice of Mohammed 20S and the pru- 
dence of the caliphs: the Magians or Ghebers were ranked with the 
Jews and Christians among the people of the written law; 204 and as 
late as the third century of the Hegira, the city of Herat will afford a 
lively contrast of private zeal and public toleration. 205 Under the pay- 
ment of an annual tribute, the Mohammedan law secured to the Gheb- 
ers of Herat their civil and religious liberties: but the recent and humble 
mosch was overshadowed by the antique splendour of the adjoining 
temple of fire. A fanatic Imam deplored, in his sermons, the scandaloua 
neighbourhood, and accused the weakness or indifference of the faithful. 
Excited by his voice, the people assembled hi tumult; the two houses 
pf prayer were consumed by the flames, but the vacant ground was im- 
mediately occupied by the foundations of a new mosch. The injured 

901 The Zend or Pazend, the Bible of the Ghebers, is reckoned by themselves, 
or at least by the Mohammedans, among the ten books which Abraham re- 
ceived from heaven; and their religion is honourably styled the religion of 
Abraham (D'Herbelot, Biblioth. Orient p. 701; Hyde, de Religione veterum 
Persarum, c. iii. p. 27, 28, etc.). I much fear that we do not possess any pure 
and free description of the system of Zoroaster. Dr. Prideaux (Connection, 
vol. i. p. 300, octavo) adopts the opinion that he had been the slave and 
scholar of some Jewish prophet in the captivity of Babylon. Perhaps the 
Persians, who have been the masters of the Jews, would assert the honour 
a poor honour of being their masters. 

808 The Arabian Nights, a faithful and amusing picture of the Oriental 
world, represent in the most odious colours the Magians, or worshippers of fire, 
to whom they attribute the annual sacrifice of a Musulman. The religion of 
Zoroaster has not the least affinity with that of the Hindoos, yet they are 
often confounded by the Mohammedans; and the sword of Timour was 
sharpened by this mistake (Hist, de Timour Bee, par Cherefeddin Ali Yezdi, 
L v.).

**Hae tres sectae, Judsei, Christiani, et qui inter Persas Magorum institutes 
addicti sunt KOT' Qo-xAvj populi libri dicuntur (Reland, Dissertat torn. iii.

of the three sects, with the vague and equivocal religion of the Sabaeans, under 
which the ancient polytheists pf Charrae were allowed to shelter their idol- 
atrous worship (Hottinger, Hist Orient, p. 167, 168). 

**This singular story is related by D'Herbelot (Biblioth. Orient p. 4*8, 
449) on the faith of Khondemir, and by Mirchond himself (Hist, priorum 
Regum Persarum, etc., p. 9, 10, not p. 88, 89). 



2 &lt;* THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

Hagi appealed to the sovereign of Chorasan; he promised justice and 
relief; when, behold! four thousand citizens of Herat, of a grave charac- 
ter and mature age, unanimously swore that the idolatrous fane had 
never existed; the inquisition was silenced, and their conscience was 
satisfied (says the historian Mirchond 206 ) with this holy and meritori- 
ous perjury. 207 But the greatest part of the temples of Persia were 
ruined by the insensible and general desertion of their votaries. It. was 
insensible, since it is not accompanied with any memorial of time or 
place, of persecution or resistance. It was general, since the whole 
realm, from Shiraz to Samarcand, imbibed the faith of the Koran; and 
the preservation of the native tongue reveals the descent of the Moham- 
medans of Persia. 208 In the mountains and deserts an obstinate race 
of unbelievers adhered to the superstition of their fathers; and a faint 
tradition of the Magian theology is kept alive in the province of Kir- 
man, along the banks of the Indus, among the exiles of Surat, and in the 
colony which, in the last century, was planted by Shaw Abbas at the 
gates of Ispahan. The chief pontiff has retired to Mount Elbourz, 
eighteen leagues from the city of Yezd: the perpetual fire (if it continue 
to burn) is inaccessible to the profane: but his residence is the school, 
the oracle, and the pilgrimage of the Ghebers, whose hard and uniform 
features attest the unmingled purity of their blood. Under the juris- 
diction of their elders, eighty thousand families maintain an innocent 
and industrious life; their subsistence is derived from some curious 
manufactiires and mechanic trades; and they cultivate the earth with 
the fervour of a religious duty. Their ignorance withstood the des- 
potism of Shaw Abbas, who demanded with threats and tortures the 

808 Mirchond (Mohammed Emir Khoondah Shah), a native of Herat, com- 
posed in the Persian language a general history of the East, from the creation 
co the year of the Hegira 875 (A.D. 1471). In the year 904 (A.D. 1498) the 
historian obtained the command of ajprincely library, and his applauded work, 
in seven or twelve parts, was abbreviated in three volumes by his son Khon- 
demir, A.H. 927 (A.D. 1520). The two writers, most accurately distinguished 
by Petit de la Croix (Hist, de Genghizcan, p. 537, 538, 544, 545), are loosely 
confounded by D'Herbelot (p. 358, 410, 994, 995) ; but his numerous extracts, 
under the improper name of Khondemir, belong to the father rather than the 
son. The historian of Genghizcan refers to a MS. of Mirchond, which he 
received from the hands of his friend D'Herbelot himself. A curious frag- 
ment (the. Taherian and Soffarian Dynasties) has been lately published in 
Persic and Latin ( Viennse, 1782, in 4to, cum notis Bernard de Jenisch) ; and 
the editor allows us to hope for a continuation of Mirchond. 

207 Quo testimonio boni se quidpiam prsestitisse opinabantur. Yet Mirchond 
must have condemned their zeal, since he approved the legal toleration of the 
Magi, cui (the fire temple) peracto singulis annis censu, uti sacra Mohan** 
raedis lege cautum, ab omnibus molestiis ac oneribus libero esse licuit. 

**The last Magian of name and power appears to be Mardavige the 
Dilemite, who, in the beginning of the tenth century, reigned in the northern 
provinces of Persia, near the Caspian Sea (D'Herbelot, Biblioth. Orient. 
p. 355). But his soldiers and successors, the Bowides, either professed or 
embraced the Mohammedan faith; and under their dynasty (A.D. 933-1020) 
I should place the fall of the religion of Zoroaster.

prophetic books of Zoroaster; and this obscure remnant of the Magians 
is spared by the moderation or contempt of their present sovereigns. 209 
The Northern coast of Africa is the only land in which the light of 
the Gospel, after a long and perfect establishment, has been totally 
extinguished. The arts, which had been taught by Carthage and Rome, 
were involved in a cloud of ignorance; the doctrine of Cyprian and 
Augustin was no longer studied. Five hundred episcopal churches were 
overturned by the hostile fury of the Donatists, the Vandals, and the 
Moors. The zeal and numbers of the clergy declined; and the people, 
without discipline, or knowledge, or hope, submissively sunk Tinder the 
yoke of the Arabian prophet. Within fifty years after the expulsion of 
the Greeks, a lieutenant of Africa informed the caliph that the tribute 
of the infidels was abolished by their conversion; 210 and, though he 
sought to disguise his fraud and rebellion, his specious pretence was 
drawn from the rapid and extensive progress of the Mohammedan faith. 
In the next age an extraordinary mission of five bishops was detached 
from Alexandria to Cairoan. They were ordained by the Jacobite 
patriarch to cherish and revive the dying embers of Christianity: 211 
but the interposition of .a foreign prelate, a stranger to the Latins, an 
enemy to the Catholics, supposes the decay and dissolution of the 
African hierarchy. It was no longer the time when the successor of 
St. Cyprian, at the head of a numerous synod, could maintain an equal 
contest with the ambition of the Roman pontiff. In the eleventh cen- 
tury the unfortunate priest who was seated on the .ruins of Carthage 
implored the arms and the protection of the Vatican; and he bitterly 
complains that his naked body had been scourged fay the Saracens, and 
that his authority was disputed by the four suffragans, the tottering 
pillars of his throne. Two epistles of Gregory the Seventh 212 are des- 
tined to soothe the distress of the Catholics and the pride of a Moorish 
prince. The pope assures the sultan that they both worship the same 
God, and may hope to meet in the bosom of Abraham; but the com- 
plaint that three bishops could no longer be found to consecrate a 
brother, announces the speedy and inevitable ruin of the episcopal order,

^8 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

I he Christians of Africa and Spain had long since submitted to the 
practice of circumcision and the legal abstinence from wine and pork; 
and the name of Mozarabes 233 (adoptive Arabs) was applied to their 
dvil or religious conformity. 214 About the middle of the twelfth cen- 
tury the worship of Christ and the succession of pastors were abolished 
along the coast of Barbary, and in the kingdoms of Cordova and Seville, 
of Valencia and Granada. 215 The throne of the Almohades, or Uni- 
tarians, was founded on the blindest fanaticism, and their extraordinary 
rigour might be provoked or justified by the recent victories and intol- 
erant zeal of the princes of Sicily and Castille, of Arragon and Portugal. 
The faith of the Mozarabes was occasionally revived by the papal mis- 
sionaries; and, on the landing of Charles the Fifth, some families of 
Latin Christians were encouraged to rear their heads at Tunis and 
Algiers. But the seed of the Gospel was quickly eradicated, and the 
long province from Tripoli to the Atlantic has lost all memory of the 
language and religion of Rome. 210 

After the revolution of eleven centuries the Jews and Christians of 
the Turkish empire enjoy the liberty of conscience which was granted 
by the Arabian caliphs. During the first age of the conquest they sus- 
pected the loyalty of the Catholics, whose name of Melchites betrayed 
their secret attachment to the Greek emperpr, while the Nestorians and 
Jacobites, his inveterate enemies, approved themselves the sincere and 
voluntary friends of the Mohammedan government. 217 Yet this par- 

"* Mozarabes, or Mostarabes, adscititii, as it is interpreted in Latin (Pocock, 
Specimen Hist Arabum, p. 39, 40; Biblioth. Arabico-Hispana, torn. ii. p. 18). 
The Mozarabic liturgy, the ancient ritual of the church of Toledo, has been 
attacked by the popes, and exposed to the doubtful trials of the sword and of 
fire (Marian. Hist. Hispan. torn. i. 1. ix. c. 18, p. 378). It was, or rather it is, 
in the Latin tongue; yet in the eleventh century it was found necessary 
(AJE.C. 1087 A.D. 1039) to transcribe an Arabic version of the canons of the 
councils of Spain (Biblioth. Arab. Hisp. torn. i. p. 547), for the use of the 
bishops and clergy in the Moorish kingdoms. 

*" About the middle of the tenth century the clergy of Cordova was re- 
proached with this criminal compliance by the intrepid envoy of the emperor 
Otho I. (Vit Johan. Gorz, in Secul. Benedict. V. No. 115, apud Fleury, Hist. 
Eccl6s. torn. xii. p. 91). 

^Pagi, Critica, torn. iv. A.D. 1149, No. 8, 9. He justly observes that, when 
Seville, etc., were taken by Ferdinand of Castille, no Christians, except cap- 
tives, were found in the place; and that the Mozarabic churches of Africa 
and Spain, described by James a Vitriaco, A.D. 1218 (Hist. Hierosol. c. 80, 
p. 1095, in Gest. Dei per Francos), are copied from some older book. I shall 
add that the date of the Hegira 677 (A.D. 1278) must apply to the copy, not 
the composition, of ,a treatise of jurisprudence, which states the civil rights 
of the Christians of Cordova (Biblioth. Arab. Hisp. torn. i. p. 471), and that 
the Jews were the only dissenters whom Abul Waled, king of Granada, 
(AJ&gt;. 1313), could either discountenance or tolerate (torn. ii. p. 288).

tial jealousy was healed by time and submission; the churches of 
Egypt were shared with the Catholics; 218 and all the Oriental sects 
were included in the common benefits of toleration. The rank, the 
immunities, the domestic jurisdiction of the patriarchs, the bishops, 
and the clergy, were protected by the civil magistrate: the learning of 
individuals recommended them to the employments of secretaries and 
physicians: they were enriched by the lucrative collection of the reve- 
nue; and their merit was sometimes raised to the command of cities 
and provinces. A caliph of the house of Abbas was heard to declare 
that the Christians were most worthy of trust in the administration of 
Persia. "The Moslems/' said he, "will abuse their present fortune; 
the Magians regret their fallen greatness; and the Jews are impatient 
for their approaching deliverance." 219 But the slaves of despotism are 
exposed to the alternative of favour and disgrace. The captive churches 
of the East have been afflicted in every age by the avarice or bigotry 
of their rulers; and the ordinary and legal restraints must be offensive 
to the pride, or the zeal, of the Christians. 220 About two hundred years 
after Mohammed, they were separated from their fellow-subjects by a 
turban or girdle of a less honourable colour; instead of horses or mules, 
they were condemned to ride on asses, in the attitude of women. Their 
public and private buildings were measured by a diminutive standard; 
in the streets or the baths it is their duty to give way or bow down be- 
fore tie meanest of the people; and their testimony is rejected if it 
may tend to the prejudice of a true believer. The pomp of processions, 
the sound of bells or of psalmody, is interdicted in their worship; a ' 
decent reverence for the national faith is imposed on their sermons and 
conversations; and the sacrilegious attempt to enter a mosch, or to 
seduce a Musulman, will not be suffered to escape with impunity. In 
a time, however, of tranquillity and justice the Christians have never 
been compelled to renounce the Gospel, or to embrace the Koran; but 
the punishment of death is inflicted for the apostates who have pro- 
fessed and deserted the law of Mohammed. The martyrs of Cordova

inconstancy, or their passionate invectives against the person and re- 
ligion of the prophet. 221 

At the end of the first century of the Hegira the caliphs were the 
most potent and absolute monarchs of the globe. Their prerogative 
was not circumscribed, either in right or in fact, by the power of the 
nobles, the freedom of the commons, the privileges of the church, the 
votes of a senate, or the memory of a free constitution. The authority 
of the companions of Mohammed expired with their lives; and the 
chiefs or emirs of the Arabian tribes left behind in the desert the spirit 
of equality and independence. The regal and sacerdotal characters 
were united in the successors of Mohammed; and if the Koran was the 
rule of their actions, they were the supreme judges and interpreters of 
that divine book. They reigned by the right of conquest over the 
nations of the East, to whom the name of liberty was unknown, and 
who were accustomed to applaud in their tyrants the acts of violence 
and severity that were exercised at their own expense. Under the last 
of the Ommiades the Arabian empire extended two hundred days' jour- 
ney from east to west, from the confines of Tartary and India to the 
shores of the Atlantic Ocean. And if we retrench the sleeve of the 
robe, as it is styled by their writers, the long and narrow province of 
Africa, the solid and compact dominion from Fargana to Aden, from 
Tarsus to Surat, will spread on every side to the measure of four or 
five months of the march of a caravan. 222 We should vainly seek the 
indissoluble union and easy obedience that pervaded the government 
of Augustus and the Antonines; but the progress of the Mohammedan 
religion diffused over this ample space a general resemblance of man- 
ners and opinions. The language and laws of the Koran were studied 
with equal devotion at Samarcand and Seville: the Moor and the Indian 
embraced as countrymen and brothers in the pilgrimage of Mecca; and 
the Arabian language was adopted as the popular idiom in all the prov- 
inces to the westward of the Tigris. 228 

431 The martyrs of Cordova (A.D. 850, etc.) are commemorated and justified 
by St Eulogius, who at length fell a victim himself. A synod* convened by 
the caliph, ambiguously censured their rashness. The moderate Fleury cannot 
reconcile their conduct with the discipline of antiquity, toutefois Tautoritl 
de 1'eglise, etc. (Fleury, Hist Eccles. torn* x. p. 415-522, particularly p. 451, 
508, 509). Their authentic acts throw a strong, though transient, light on 
the Spanish church in the ninth century. 

30 See the article Eslamiah (as we say Christendom), in the Bibliotheque 
Qrientale (p. 325). This chart of the Mohammedan world is suited by the 
author, Ebn Alwardi, to the year of the Hegira 385 (A.D. 995). Since that 
time the losses in Spain have been overbalanced by the conquests in India, 
Tartary, and the European Turkey. 

** The Arabic of the Koran is taught as a dead language in the college of 
Mecca. By the Danish traveller this ancient idiom is compared to the Latin; 
the vulgar tongue of Hejaz and Yemen to the Italian; and the Arabian 
dialects of Syria, Egypt, Africa, etc., to the Provencal, Spanish, and Portu- 
guese (Niebuhr, Description de. TArabie, p. 74, etc.).

The Two Sieges of Constantinople by */u? Arabs Their Invasion of France 
and Defeat by Charles Martel Civil War of the Ommiade* and Abbaf* 
sides Learning of the Arabs Luxury of the Caliphs Naval Enterprise* 
on Crete, Sicily, and Rome Decay and Division of the Empire of the

WHEN the Arabs first issued from the desert they must have been sur- 
prised at the ease and rapidity of their own success. But when they 
advanced in the career of victory to the banks of the Indus and the 
summit of the Pyrenees, when they had repeatedly tried the edge of 
their scimitars and the energy of their faith, they might be equally 
astonished that any nation could resist their invincible arms, that any 
boundary should confine the dominion of the successor of the prophet. 
The confidence of soldiers and fanatics may indeed be excused, sine* 
the calm historian of the present hour, who strives to follow the rapid 
course of the Saracens, must study to explain by what means the church 
and state were saved from this impending, and, as it should seem, from 
this inevitable danger. The deserts of Scythia and Sarmatia might be 
guarded by their extent, their dimate, their poverty, and the courage 
of the northern shepherds; China was remote and inaccessible; but 
the greatest part of the temperate zone was subject to the Mohammedan 
conquerors, the Greeks were exhausted by the calamities of war and the 
loss of their fairest provinces, and the barbarians of Europe might justly 
tremble at the precipitate fall of the Gothic monarchy. In this inquiry 
I shall unfold the events that rescued our ancestors of Britain, and our 
neighbours of Gaul, from the civil and religious yoke of the Koran; that 
protected the majesty of Rome, and delayed the servitude of Constan- 
tinople- that invigorated the defence of the Christians, and scattered 
among their enemies the seeds of division and decay. 

Forty-six years after the flight of Mohammed from Mecca his disciples 
appeared an arms under the walls of Constantinople. 1 They were 
animated by a genuine or fictitious saying of the prophet, that, to the 
first army which besieged the city of the Caesars, their sins were forgiven: 
the long series of Roman triumphs would be meritoriously transferred 
to the conquerors of New Rome; and the wealth of nations was deposited 
in this well-chosen seat of royalty and commerce. No sooner had the 
caliph Moawiyah suppressed his rivals and established Ms throne, thai? 

1 Theophanes places .the seven years of the siege of Constantinople in the 
year of our Christian era 673 (of the Alexandrian. 665, Sept i), and the 
peace of the Saracens four years afterwards ; a glaring inconsistency 1 which 
Petavius, Goar, and Pagi (Critica, torn. iv. p. 63, 64) have straggled to 
remove. Of the Arabians, the Hegira 52 (AJX 672, January 8) is assigned 
by Elmacin [p. 56], the year 48 (A.D. 668, Feb. 20) by Abulfeda, -whose testi- 
mony I esteem the most convenient and creditable.

he aspired to expiate the guilt of civil blood by the success and glory 
of this holy expedition; 2 his preparations by sea and land were adequate 
to the importance of the object; his standard was intrusted to Sophian, 3 
a veteran warrior, but the troops were encouraged by the example and 
presence of Yezid, the son and presumptive heir of the commander of 
the faithful. The Greeks had little to hope, nor had their enemies any 
reasons of fear, from the courage and vigilance of the reigning emperor, 
who disgraced the name of Constantine, and imitated only the inglorious 
years of his grandfather Heraclius. Without delay or opposition, the 
naval forces of the Saracens passed through the unguarded channel of 
the Hellespont, which even now, under the feeble and disorderly gov- 
ernment of the Turks, is maintained as the natural bulwark of the 
capital. 4 The Arabian fleet cast anchor, and the troops were disem- 
barked near the palace of Hebdomon, seven miles from the city. During 
many days, from the dawn of light to the evening, the line of assault was 
extended from the golden gate to the eastern promontory, and the 
foremost warriors were impelled by the weight and effort of the succeed- 
ing columns. But the besiegers had formed an insufficient estimate of 
the strength and resources of Constantinople. The solid and lofty walls 
were guarded by numbers and discipline: the spirit of the Romans was 
rekindled by the last danger of their religion and empire: the fugitives 
from the conquered provinces more successfully renewed the defence of 
Damascus and Alexandria; and the Saracens were dismayed by the 
strange and prodigious effects of artificial fire. This firm and effectual 
resistance diverted their arms to the more easy attempts of plundering 
the European and Asiatic coasts of the Propontis; and, after keeping 
the sea from the month of April to that of September, on the approach 
of winter they retreated fourscore miles from the capital, to the isle 
of Cyzicus, in which they had established their magazine of spoil and 
provisions. So patient was their perserverance, or so languid were their 
operations, that they repeated in the six following summers the same 
attack and retreat, with a gradual abatement of hope and vigour, till

details; but he seems to write for the amusement, rather than the instruction, 
of his reader. Perhaps, on the approach of the enemy, the minister of Con- 
stantine was occupied, like that of Mustapha, in finding two Canary-birds 
who should sing precisely the same note. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 213 

the mischances of shipwreck and disease, of the sword and of fire, com- 
pelled them to relinquish the fruitless enterprise. They might bewail 
the loss, or commemorate the martyrdom, of thirty thousand Moslems 
who fell in the siege of Constantinople; and the solemn funeral of Abu 
Ayub, or Job, excited the curiosity of the Christians themselves. That 
venerable Arab, one of the last of the companions of Mohammed, was 
numbered among the ansars, or auxiliaries, of Medina, who sheltered the 
head of the flying prophet. In his youth he fought, at Beder and Ohud, 
under the holy standard: in his mature age he was the friend and 
follower of Ali; and the last remnant of his strength and life was con- 
sumed in a distant and dangerous war against the enemies of the Koran. 
His memory was revered; but the place of his burial was neglected and 
unknown, during a period of seven hundred and eighty years, till the 
conquest of Constantinople by Mohammed the Second. A seasonable 
vision (for such are the manufacture of every religion) revealed the 
holy spot at the foot of the walls and the bottom of the harbour; and 
the mosch of Ayub has been deservedly chosen for the simple and martial 
inauguration of the Turkish sultans. 6 

The event of the siege revived, both in the East and West, the reputa- 
tion of the Roman arms, and cast a momentary shade over the glories 
of the Saracens. The Greek ambassador was favourably received at 
Damascus, in a general council of the emirs or Koreish: a peace, or 
truce, of thirty years was ratified between the two empires; and the 
stipulation of an annual tribute, fifty horses of a noble breed, fifty 
slaves, and three thousand pieces of gold, degraded the majesty of the 
commander of the faithful. 6 The aged caliph was desirous of possessing 
his dominions, and ending his days, in tranquillity and repose: while 
the Moors and Indians trembled at his name&gt; his palace and city of 
Damascus was insulted by the Mardaites, or Maronites, of Mount 
Libanus, the firmest barrier of the empire, till they were disarmed and 
transplanted by the suspicious policy of the Greeks. 7 After the revolt 
of Arabia and Persia, the house of Ommiyah 8 was reduced to the king-

State of the Ottoman Empire, p. 10, n; Voyages de Thevenot, part i. p. 189. 
The Christians, who suppose that the martyr of Abu Ayub is vulgarly con- 
founded with the patriarch Job, betray their own ignorance rather than that 
of the Turks. 

'Theophanes, though a Greek, deserves credit for these tributes (Chrono- 
graph, p. 295, 296, 300, 301 [vol. i. p. 543, 552, ed. Bonn]), which are con- 
firmed, with some variation, by the Arabic History of Abulpharagius (Dynast,

dom of Syria and Egypt: their distress and fear enforced their compliance 
with the pressing demands of the Christians; and the tribute was 
increased to a slave, a horse, and a thousand pieces of gold, for each of 
the three hundred and sixty-five days of the solar year. But as soon as 
the empire was again united by the arms and policy of Abdalmalek, he 
disclaimed a badge of servitude not less injurious to his conscience than 
to his pride; he discontinued the payment of the tribute; and the 
resentment of the Greeks was disabled from action by the mad tyranny 
of the second Justinian, the just rebellion of his subjects, and the fre- 
quent change of his antagonists and successors. Till the reign of 
Abdalmalek the Saracens had been content with the free possession of 
the Persian and Roman treasures in the coin of Chosroes and Caesar. 
By the command of that caliph a national mint was established, both 
for silver and gold, and the inscription of the Dinar, though it might be 
censured by some timorous casuists, proclaimed the unity of the God 
of Mohammed. 9 Under the reign of the caliph Walid, the Greek 
language and characters were excluded from the accounts of the public 
revenue. 10 If this change was productive of the invention or familiar 
use of our present numerals, the Arabic or Indian ciphers, as they are 
commonly styled, a regulation of office has promoted the most impor- 
tant discoveries of arithmetic, algebra, and the mathematical sciences. 11

*Elmacin, who dates the first coinage A.H. 76, A.D 695, five or six years 
later than the Greek historians, has compared the weight of the best or 
common gold dinar to the drachm or dirhem of Egypt (p. 77)., which may 
be equal to two pennies (48 grains) of our ^ Troy weight (Hooper's Enquiry 
tnto Ancient Measures, p. 24-36), and equivalent to eight shillings of our 
sterling money. From the same Elmacin and the Arabian plrysicians some 
dinars as high as two dirhems, as low as ^ half &amp; dirhem, may be deduced. 
The piece of silver was the dirhem, both in value and weight : but an old, 
though fair coin, struck at Waset, A.H. 88, and preserved in the Bodleian 
library, wants four grains of the Cairo standard (see the Modern Universal 
History, torn. i. p. 548, of the French translation). 

[The following are the chief facts relating to the coinage of the Saracens, 
being based on Mr. S. Lane-Poole's Coins and Medals: 

At first the Arabs usad the Byzantine coinage, until about A.II. 70, when 
the caliph Ali attempted to introduce a distinctively Muslim coinage. But 
it was very tentative, and it was not until six years later, A.H. 76, that the 
caliph Abd-El-Melik struck the first regular system. The two chief coins 
were the gold dinar (from Roman denarius') and the silver dirhem (from 
Greek drachma), the former weighing sixty-five grains and the latter forty- 
three. The dinar was worth about US. 6d. under the Ommiade caliphs* while 
the dirhem was worth about is. I 3/iocf. Q. S.]

THE ROMAN EMPIRE 215 

Whilst the caliph Walid sat idle on the throne of Damascus, while his 
lieutenants achieved the conquest of Transoxiana and Spain, a third 
army of Saracens overspread the provinces of Asia Minor, and 
approached the borders of the Byzantine capital. But the attempt and 
disgrace of the second siege was reserved for his brother Soliman, whose 
ambition appears to have been quickened by a more active and martial 
spirit. In the revolutions of the Greek empire, after the tyrant Justin- 
ian had been punished and avenged, a humble secretary, Anastasius or 
Artemius, was promoted by chance or merit to the vacajit purple. He 
was alarmed by the sound of war; and his ambassador returned from 
Damascus with the tremendous news that the Saracens were preparing 
an armament by sea and land, such as would transcend the experience 
of the past, or the belief of the present, age. The precautions of 
Anastasius were not unworthy of his station, or of the impending danger. 
He issued a peremptory mandate, that all persons who were not provided 
with the means of subsistence for a three years' siege should evacuate 
the city: the public granaries and arsenals were abundantly replenished; 
the walls were restored and strengthened; and the engines for casting 
stones, or darts, or fire, were stationed along the ramparts, or in the 
brigantines of war, of which an additional number was hastily con- 
structed. To prevent is safer, as well as more honourable, than to repel 
an attack; and a design was meditated, above the usual spirit of the 
Greeks, of burning the naval stores of the enemy, the cypress timber 
that had been hewn in Mount Libanus, and was piled along the sea- 
shore of Phoenicia, for the service of the Egyptian fleet. This generous 
enterprise was defeated by the cowardice or treachery of the troops, 
who, in the new language of the empire, were styled of the Qbsequian 
Theme. 1 * They murdered their chief, deserted their standard in the 
isle of Rhodes, dispersed themselves over the adjacent continent, and 
deserved pardon or reward by investing with the purple a simple officer 
of the revenue. The name of Theodosius might recommend Mm to the 
senate and people; but after some months he sunk into a cloister, and 
resigned, to the firmer hand of Leo the Isaurian, the urgent defence of 
the capital and empire. The most formidable of the Saracens, Mosle- 
mah the brother of the caliph, was advancing at the head of one hundred 
and twenty thousand Arabs and Persians, the greater part mounted

on horses or camels; and the successful sieges of Tyana, Amorium, and 
Pergamus were of sufficient duration to exercise their skill and to elevate 
their hopes. At the well-known passage of Abydus, on the Hellespont, 
the Mohammedan arms were transported, for the first time, from Asia 
to Europe. 18 From thence, wheeling round the Thracian cities of the 
Propontis, Moslemah invested Constantinople on the land side, sur- 
rounded his camp with a ditch and rampart, prepared and planted his 
engines of assault, and declared, by words and actions, a patient resolu- 
tion of expecting the return of seed-time and harvest, should the 
obstinacy of the besieged prove equal to his own. The Greeks would 
gladly have ransomed their religion and empire by a fine or assessment 
of a piece of gold on the head of each inhabitant of the city; but the 
liberal offer was rejected with disdain, and the presumption of Moslemah 
was exalted by the speedy approach and invincible force of the navies of 
Egypt and Syria. They are said to have amounted to eighteen hundred 
ships: the number betrays their inconsiderable size; and of the twenty 
stout and capacious vessels, whose magnitude impeded their progress, 
each was manned with no more than one hundred heavy-armed soldiers. 
This huge armada proceeded on a smooth sea, and with a gentle gale, 
towards the mouth of the Bosphorus; the surface of the strait was 
overshadowed, in the language of the Greeks, with a moving forest, and 
the same fatal night had been fixed by the Saracen chief for a general 
assault by sea and land. To allure the confidence of the enemy the 
emperor had thrown aside the chain that usually guarded the entrance 
of the harbour; but while they hesitated whether they should seize the 
opportunity or apprehend the snare, the ministers of destruction were 
at hand. The fire-ships of the Greeks were launched against them; 
the Arabs, their arms, and vessels were involved in the same flames; 
the disorderly fugitives were dashed against each other or overwhelmed 
in the waves; and I no longer find a vestige of the fleet that had 
threatened to extirpate the Roman name. A still more fatal and irrepar- 
able loss was that of the caliph Soliman, who died of an indigestion, 14 
in his camp near Kinnisrin or Chalcis in Syria, as he was preparing to 
lead against Constantinople the remaining forces of the East. The 
brother of Moslemah was succeeded by a kinsman and an enemy; and 
the throne of an active and able prince was degraded by the useless 
and pernicious virtues of a bigot. While he started and satisfied the 
scruples of a blind conscience, the siege was continued through the winter 

14 [This was the second attack on Constantinople ; the first is recorded on 
P- 789-791. O. S.] 

**The caliph had emptied two baskets of eggs and of figs, which he swal- 
lowed alternately, and the repast was concluded with marrow and sugar. In 
one of his pilgrimages to Mecca, Soliman ate, at a single meal, seventy pome- 
granates, a kid, six fowls, and a huge quantity of the grapes of Tayef. If 
the bill of fare be correct, we must admire the appetite, rather than the 
luxury, of the sovereign of Asia (Abulfeda, Annal. Moslem, p. 126). 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 3I7 

by the neglect, rather than by the resolution of the caliph Omar. 15 The 
winter proved uncommonly rigorous: above a hundred days the ground 
was covered with deep snow, and the natives of the sultry climes of 
Egypt and Arabia lay torpid and almost lifeless in their frozen camp. 
They revived on the return of spring; a second effort had been made in 
their favour, and their distress was relieved by the arrival of two 
numerous fleets laden with corn, and arms, and soldiers; the first from 
Alexandria, of four hundred transports and galleys; the second, of three 
hundred and sixty vessels, from the ports of Africa. But the Greek 
fires were again kindled, and, if the destruction was less complete, it 
was owing to the experience which had taught the Moslems to remain at 
a safe distance, or to the perfidy of the Egyptian mariners, who deserted 
with their ships to the emperor of the Christians. The trade and naviga- 
tion of the capital were restored; and the produce of the fisheries 
supplied the wants, and even the luxury, of the inhabitants. But the 
calamities of famine and disease were soon felt by the troops of Mosle- 
mah, and, as the former was miserably assuaged, so the latter was 
dreadfully propagated, by the pernicious nutriment which hunger com- 
pelled them to extract from the most unclean or unnatural food. The 
spirit of conquest, and even of enthusiasm, was extinct: the Saracens 
could no longer straggle beyond their lines, either single or in small 
parties, without exposing themselves to the merciless retaliation of the 
Thracian peasants. An army of Bulgarians was attracted from the 
Danube by the gifts and promises of Leo; and these savage auxiliaries 
made some atonement for the evils which they had inflicted on the 
empire by the defeat and slaughter of twenty-two thoijsand Asiatics. 
A report' was dexterously scattered that the Franks, the unknown nations 
of the Latin world, were arming by sea and land in the defence of the 
Christian cause, and their formidable aid was expected with far different 
sensations in the camp and city. At length, after a siege of thirteen 
months, 16 the hopeless Modemah received from the caliph the welcome 
permission of retreat. The march of the Arabian cavalry over the 
Hellespont and through the provinces of Asia was executed without 
delay or molestation; but an army of their brethren had been cut in

mundanis. He was so desirous of being with God, that he would not have 
anointed his ear (his own saying) to obtain a perfect cure of his last malady. 
The caliph had only one shirt, and in an age of luxury his annual expense 
was no more than two drachms (Abulpharagius, p. 131). Haud diu gavisus

"Both Nicephorus [p. 36] and Theophanes agree that the siege of Con- 
stantinople was raised the I5th of August (A.D. 718) ; but as the former, our

pieces on the side of Bithynia, and the remains of the fleet were so 
repeatedly damaged by tempest and fire, that only five galleys entered 
the port of Alexandria to relate the tale of their various and almost 
incredible disasters. 17 

In the two sieges the deliverance of Constantinople may be chiefly 
ascribed to the novelty, the terrors, and the real efficacy of the Greek 
fire. 18 The important secret of compounding and directing this artificial 
flame was imparted by Callinicus, a native of Heliopolis in Syria, who 
deserted from the service of the caliph to that of the emperor."* The 
skill of a chemist and engineer was equivalent to the succour of fleets 
and armies; and this discovery or improvement of the military art was 
fortunately reserved for the distressful period when the degenerate 
Romans of the East were incapable of contending with the warlike 
enthusiasm and youthful vigour of the Saracens. The historian who 
presumes to analyse this extraordinary composition should suspect his 
own ignorance and that of his Byzantine guides, so prone to the mar- 
vellous, so careless, and, in this instance, so jealous of the truth. From 
their obscure, and perhaps fallacious hints, it should seem that the 
principal ingredient of the Greek fire was the naphtha, or liquid 
bitumen, a light, tenacious, and inflammable oil, 21 which springs

from the earth, and_catches fire as soon as it comes in contact with the 
air. The naphtha was mingled, I know not by what methods or in what 
proportions, with sulphur and with the pitch that is extracted from 
evergreen firs. 22 From this mixture, which produced a thick smoke 
and a loud explosion, proceeded a fierce and obstinate flame, which not 
only rose in perpendicular ascent, but likewise burnt with equal vehe- 
mence in descent or lateral progress; instead of being extinguished 4 
it was nourished and quickened by tie element of water; and sand, 
urine, or vinegar, were the only remedies that could damp the fury of 
this powerful agent, which was justly denominated by the Greeks the 
liquid, or the maritime, fire. For the annoyance of the enemy, it was 
employed with equal effect by sea and land, in battles or in sieges. It was 
either poured from the rampart in large boilers, or launched in red-hot 
balls of stone and iron, or darted in arrows and javelins, twisted round 
with flax and tow, which had deeply imbibed the inflammable oil; 
sometimes it was deposited in fireships, the victims and instruments of 
a more ample revenge, and was most commonly blown through long 
tubes of copper, which were planted on the prow of a galley, and 
fancifully shaped into the mouths of savage monsters, that seemed 
to vomit a stream of liquid and consuming fire. This important art 
was preserved at Constantinople, as the palladium of the stage: the 
galleys and artillery might occasionally be lent to the allies of Rome; 
but the composition of the Greek fire was concealed with the most jealous 
scruple, and the terror of the enemies was increased and prolonged by 
their ignorance and surprise. In the treatise of the administration of 
the empire, the royal author 23 suggests the answers and excuses that 
might best dude the indiscreet curiosity and importunate demands of 
the barbarians. They should be told that the mystery of the Greek 
fire had been revealed by an angel to the first and greatest of the Con- 
stantines, with a sacred injunction that this gift of Heaven, this peculiar 
blessings of the Romans, should never be communicated to any foreign 
nation: that the prince and subject were alike bound to religious silence 
under the temporal and spiritual penalties of treason and sacrilege; and 
that the impious attempt would provoke the sudden and supernatural

vengeance of the God of the Christians. By these precautions the secret 
was confined, above four hundred years, to the Romans of the East; 
and at the end of the eleventh century, the Pisans, to whom every sea 
and every art were familiar, suffered the effects, without understanding 
the composition, of the Greek fire. It was at length either discovered 
or stolen by the Mohammedans; and, in the holy wars of Syria and 
Egypt, they retorted an invention, contrived against themselves, on the 
heads of the Christians. A knight, who despised the swords and lances 
of the Saracens, relates with heartfelt sincerity his own fears, and those 
of his companions, at the sight and sound of the mischievous engine 
that discharged a torrent of the Greek fire, the feu Gregeois, as 'it is 
styled by the more early of the French writers. It came flying through 
tie air, says Joinville, 2 * like a winged long-tailed dragon, about the 
thickness of a hogshead, with the report of thunder and the velocity of 
lightning; and the darkness of the night was dispelled by this deadly 
illumination. The use of the Greek, or, as it might now be called, of 
the Saracen fire, was continued to the middle of the fourteenth century, 25 
when the scientific or casual compound of nitre, sulphur, and charcoal 
effected a new revolution in the art of war and the history of mankind. 20 
Constantinople and the Greek fire might exclude the Arabs from the 
eastern entrance of Europe; but in the West, on the side of the Pyrenees, 
the provinces of Gaul were threatened and invaded by the conquerors 
of Spain. 27 The decline of the French monarchy invited the attack 

*Histoire de St Louis, p. 39; Paris, 1668, p. 445 Paris, de rimprimerie 
Royale, 1761. The former of these editions is precious for the observations 
of Ducange; the latter for the pure and original text of Joinville. We must 
have recourse to that text to discover that the feu Gregeois was shot with a 
pile or javelin from an engine that acted like a sling. 

"The vanity, or envy, of shaking the established property of Fame, has 
tempted some moderns to carry gunpowder above the fourteenth (see Sir 
William Temple, Dutens, etc.), and the Greek fire above the seventh century 
(see the Saluste du President des Brosses, torn. ii. p. 381). But their evidence, 
which precedes the vulgar era of the invention, is seldom clear or satisfactory, 
and subsequent writers may be suspected of fraud or credulity. In the 
earliest sieges some combustibles of oil and sulphur have been used, and the 
Greek fire has some affinities with gunpowder both in its nature and effects : 
for the antiquity of the first, a passage of Procopius (de Bell. Goth. 1. iv. 
c. ii [t ii. p. 512, ed. Bonn]) ; for that of the second, some facts in the 
Arabic history of Spain (A.D. 1249, J 3 I2 I 33 2 1 Biblioth. Arab. Hisp. torn. ii. 
p. 6, 7, 8) are the most difficult to elude. 

84 That extraordinary man, Friar Bacon, reveals two of the ingredients, 
saltpetre and sulphur, and conceals the third in a sentence of mysterious 
gibberish, as if he dreaded the consequences of his own discovery (Biog, 
Brit vol. i. p. 430, new edition). 

"For the invasion of France, and the defeat of the Arabs by Charles 
Martel, see the Historia Arabum (c. ii, 12," 13, 14) of Roderic Ximenes, 
archbishop of Toledo, who had before him the Christian Chronicle of 
Isidore Pacensis, and the Mohammedan history of Novairi. The Moslems 
are silent or concise in the account of their losses, but M. Cardonne (torn. i. 
p. 129, 130, 131) has given a pure and simple account of all that he could 
collect from Ibn Halikan, Hidjazi, and an anonymous writer. The texts

of these insatiate fanatics. The descendants of Clovis had lost the 
inheritance of his martial and ferocious spirit; and their misfortune 
or demerit has affixed the epithet of lazy to the last kings of the Mer- 
ovingian race. 28 They ascended the throne without power, and suni 
into the grave without a name. A country palace, in the neighbourhood 
of Compifegne, 29 was allotted for their residence or prison: but each year, 
in the month of March or May, they were conducted in a waggon drawn 
by oxen to the assembly of the Franks, to give audience to foreign 
ambassadors and to ratify the acts of the mayor of the palace. That 
domestic officer was become the minister of the nation and the master 
of the prince. A public employment was converted into the patrimony 
of a private family: the elder Pepin left a king of mature years under 
the guardianship of his own widow and her child; and these feeble 
regents were forcibly dispossessed by the most active of his bastards. 
A government, half savage and half corrupt, was almost dissolved; and 
the tributary dukes, and provincial counts, and the territorial lords, were 
tempted to despise the weakness of the monarch, and to imitate the 
ambition of the mayor. Among these independent chiefs, one of the 
boldest and most successful was Eudes duke of Aqintain, who in the 
southern provinces of Gaul usurped the authority, and even the title, 
of king. The Goths, the Gascons, and the Franks assembled under 
the standard of this Christian hero: he repelled the first invasion of 
the Saracens; and Zama, lieutenant of the caliph, lost his army and 
his life under the walls of Toulouse. The ambition of his successors 
was stimulated by revenge; they repassed the Pyrenees with the means 
and the resolution of conquest. The advantageous situation which had 
recommended Narbonne * as the first Roman colony was again chosen 
by the Moslems: they claimed the province of Septimania or Languedoc 
as a just dependence of the Spanish monarchy: the vineyards of Gas- 
cony and the city of Bordeaux were possessed by the sovereign of

of Bouquet (torn, iii.) and the Annals of Pagi, who (torn, xil under the

in the Annals of Baronius. The Dictionary of Bayle (Abdertane and 
Munusa) has more merit for uvely reflection than original research.

the French reader will for ever repeat the beautiful lines of Boileau's Lutrin.

world (D'Anville, Notice de 1'Ancienne Gaule, p. 473)-

Damascus and Samarcand; and the south of France, from the mouth of 
the Garonne to that of the Rhone, assumed the manners and religion 
of Arabia. 81 

But these narrow limits were scorned by the spirit of Abdalrahman, 
or Abderame, who had been restored by the caliph Hashem to the 
wishes of the soldiers and people of Spain. That veteran and daring 
commander adjudged to the obedience of the prophet whatever yet 
remained of France or of Europe; and prepared to execute the sentence, 
at the head of a formidable host, in the full confidence of surmounting 
all opposition either of nature or of man. His first care was to suppress 
a domestic rebel, who commanded the most important passes of the 
Pyrenees: Munuza, a Moorish chief, had accepted the alliance of the 
duke of Aquitain; and Eudes, from a motive of private or public interest, 
devoted his beauteous daughter to the embraces of the African mis- 
believer. But the strongest fortresses of Cerdagne were invested by a 
superior force; the rebel was overtaken and slain in the mountains; and 
his widow was sent a captive to Damascus, to gratify the desires, or more 
probably the vanity, of the commander of the faithful. From the 
Pyrenees, Abderame proceeded without delay to the passage of the 
Rhone and the siege of Aries. An army of Christians attempted 
the relief of the city: the tombs of their leaders were yet visible in tne 
thirteenth century; and many thousands of their dead bodies were 
carried down the rapid stream into the Mediterranean Sea. The arm? 
of Abderame were not less successful on the side of the ocean. He passed 
without opposition the Garonne and Dordogne, which unite their waters 
H the gulf of Bordeaux; but he found, beyond those rivers, the camp of 
tne intrepid Eudes, who had formed a second army and sustained a 
second defeat, so fatal to the Christians, that, according to their sad 
confession, God alone could reckon the number of the slain. The vic- 
torious Saracen overran the provinces of Aquitain, whose Gallic names 
are disguised, rather than lost, in the modern appellations of Perigord, 
Saintonge, and Poitou: his standards were planted on the walls, or at 
least before the gates, of Tours and of Sens; and his detachments over- 
spread the kingdom of Burgundy as far as the well-known cities of Lyons 
and Besan$on. The memory of these devastations, for Abderame did 
not spare the country or the people, was long preserved by tradition; 
and the invasion of France by the Moors or Mohammedans affords the

Alhorr, A.D. 718; but it is probable that the city and province of Narbonne 
were not reduced by them until two or three years later under the leadership 
of Samah. That leader was slain in an unsuccessful attempt to take Toulouse, 
A.D. 721, and was succeeded by Abd Errahman for a short period, and then, 
after the death of Jezid II and accession of Hashem, by Anabasa. The latter 
crossed the Pyrenees in 725, took Carcassonne and Nismes, and overran the 
whole of the south of France, After his death, which occurred in the fol- 
lowing year, several other commanders followed, but nothing further of 
importance was done- in France until Abd Errahman was again appointed

groundwork of those fables which have been so wildly disfigured in the 
romances of chivalry, and so elegantly adorned by the Italian muse. In 
the decline of society and art, the deserted cities could supply a slender 
booty to the Saracens; their richest spoil was found in the churches 
and monasteries, which they stripped of their ornaments and delivered 
to the flames: and the tutelar saints, both Hilary of Poitiers and Martin 
of Tours, forgot their miraculous powers in the defence of their own 
sepulchres. 82 A victorious line of march had been prolonged above 
a thousand miles from the rock of Gibraltar to the banks of the Loire; 
the repetition of an equal space would have carried the Saracens to the 
confines of Poland and the Highlands of Scotland; the Rhine is not 
more impassable than the Nile or Euphrates, and the Arabian fleet 
might have sailed without a naval combat into the mouth of the Thames. 
Perhaps the interpretation of the Koran would now be taught in the 
schools of Oxford, and her pulpits might demonstrate to a circumcised 
people the sanctity and truth of the revelation of Mohammed. 38 

From such calamities was Christendom delivered by the genius and 
fortune of one man. Charles, the illegitimate son of the elder Pepin, 
was content with the titles of mayor or duke of the Franks; but he 
deserved to become the father of a line of kings. In a laborious admin- 
istration of twenty-four years he restored and supported the dignity of 
the throne, and the rebels of Germany and Gaul were successively 
crushed by the activity of a warrior who in the same campaign could 
display his banner on the Elbe, the Rhone, and the shores of the ocean. 
In the public danger he was summoned by the voice of his country; and 
his rival, the duke of Aquitain, was reduced to appear among the 
fugitives and suppliants. " Alas! " exclaimed the Franks, " what a 
misfortune! what an indignity! We have long heard of the name 
and conquests of the Arabs: we were apprehensive of their attack from 
the East; they have now conquered Spain, and invade our country on 
the side of the West. Yet their numbers and (since they have no 
buckler) their arms are inferior to our own." "If you follow my 
advice," replied the prudent mayor of the palace, " you will not inter- 
rupt their march, nor precipitate your attack. They are like a torrent, 
which it is dangerous to stem in its career. The thirst of riches, and the

to his argument, and generally founded in truth and reason. He sustains the 
part of a lively and eloquent advocate, and sometimes rises to the merit of 
an historian and philosopher.

consciousness of success, redoubled their valour, and valour is of more 
avail than arms or numbers. Be patient till they have loaded themselves 
with the incumbrance of wealth. The possession of wealth will divide 
their counsels and assure your victory." This subtle policy is perhaps 
a refinement of the Arabian writers; and the situation of Charles will 
suggest a more narrow and selfish motive of procrastination; the secret 
desire of humbling the pride and wasting the provinces of the rebel 
duke of Aquitain. It is yet more probable that the delays of Charles 
were inevitable and reluctant. A standing army was unknown under 
the first and second race; more than half the kingdom was now in the 
hands of the Saracens: according to their respective situation, the 
Franks of Neustria and Austrasia were too conscious or too careless of 
the impending danger; and the voluntary aids of the Gepidae and Ger- 
mans were separated by a long interval from the standard of the 
Christian general. No sooner had he collected his forces than he sought 
and found the enemy in the centre of France, between Tours and 
Poitiers. His well-conducted march was covered by a range of hills, and 
Abderame appears to have been surprised by his unexpected presence. 
The nations of Asia, Africa, and Europe advanced with equal ardour 
to an encounter which would change the history of the world. In the 
six first days of desultory combat the horsemen and archers of the East 
maintained their advantage; but in the closer onset of the seventh day 
the Orientals were oppressed by the strength and stature of the Ger- 
mans, who, with stout hearts and iron hands, 34 asserted the civil and 
religious freedom of their posterity. The epithet of M artel, the hammer, 
which has been added to the name of Charles, is expressive of his 
weighty and irresistible strokes: the valour of Eudes was excited by 
resentment and emulation; and their companions, in the eye of history, 
are the true Peers and Paladins of French chivalry. After a bloody 
field, in which Abderame was slain, the Saracens, in the close of the 
evening, retired to their camp. In the disorder and despair of the night 
the various tribes of Yemen and Damascus, of Africa and Spain, 
were provoked to turn their arms against each other: the remains of their 
host were suddenly dissolved, and each emir consulted his safety by a 
hasty and separate retreat. At the dawn of day the stillness of a 
hostile camp was suspected by the victorious Christians: on the report 
of their spies they ventured to explore the riches of the vacant tents; 
but if we expect some celebrated relics, a small portion of the spoil was 
restored to the innocent and lawful owners. The joyful tidings were 
soon diffused over the Catholic world, and the monks of Italy could 
affirm and believe that three hundred and fifty, or three hundred and 
seventy-five, thousand of the Mohammedans had been crushed by the

hammer of Charles, 85 while no more than fifteen hundred Christians 
were slain in the field of Tours. But this incredible tale is sufficiently 
disproved by the caution of the French general, who apprehended the 
snares and accidents of a pursuit, and dismissed his German allies to 
their native forests. The inactivity of a conqueror betrays the loss of 
strength and blood, and the most cruel execution is inflicted, not in the 
ranks of battle, but on the backs of a flying enemy. Yet the victory 
of the Franks was complete and final; Aquitain was recovered by the 
arms of Eudes; the Arabs never resumed the conquest of Gaul, and they 
were soon driven beyond the Pyrenees by Charles Martd and his 
valiant race. 86 It might have been expected that the saviour of Chris- 
tendom would have been canonised, or at least applauded, by the 
gratitude of the clergy, who are indebted to his sword for their present 
existence. But in the public distress the mayor of the palace had been 
compelled to apply the riches, or at least the revenues, of the bishops and 
abbots to the relief of the state and the reward of the soldiers. His 
merits were forgotten, his sacrilege alone was remembered, and, in an 
epistle to a Carlovingian prince, a Gallic synod presumes to declare 
that his ancestor was damned; that on the opening of his tomb the 
spectators were affrighted by a smell of fire and the aspect of a horrid 
dragon; and that a saint of the times was indulged with a pleasant 
vision of the soul and body of Charles Martel burning, to all eternity, 
in the abyss of hell. 87 
The loss of an army, or a province, in the Western world was less 

85 These numbers are stated by Paul Warnefrid, the deacon of Aquileia 
(de Gestis Langobard. 1. vi. [c. 46] p. 921, edit. Grot), and Anastasius. the 
librarian of the Roman church (in Vit Gregorii II. [ap. Muratori Scrip. R. L 
voL'iii. p. 155]), who tells a miraculous story of three consecrated sponges,, 
which rendered invulnerable the French soldiers among whom they had been 
shared. It should seem that, in his letters to the pope, Eudes usurped the 
honour of the victory^ for which he is chastised by the French annalists, who, 
with equal falsehood, accuse him of inviting the Saracens. 

"Narbonne and the rest of Septimania was recovered by Pepin, the son 
of Charles Martel, A.D. 755 (Pagi, Critica, torn. iii. p. 300). Thirty-seven 
years afterwards it was pillaged by a sudden inroad of the Arabs, who 
employed the captives in the construction of the mosch of Cordova (De 
Guignes, Hist des Huns, torn. i. p. 354). 

[It is not strictly correct to say that the Arabs never resumed the conquest 
of Gaul. Maurontius, duke of Marseilles, had allied himself with^the Arabs 
in place of an alliance with the Christian champion, and had given Aries,. 
Avignon, and other, places to the lords of Narbonne, who had also secured 
possession of Lyons and Valence. Accordingly, a few years after their 
defeat at Tours, the Saracens were again in force in France, besides gar- 
risoning Valence and Lyon. They were once more beaten back by Charles- 
Martel in two campaigns, A.D. 737 and AJ&gt;. 739- 0. S.]

Charlemagne, and most probably composed by the pen of the artful Hincmar,

painful to the court of Damascus than the rise and progress of a domestic 
competitor. Except among the Syrians, the caliphs of the house of 
Ommiyah had never been the objects of the public favour. The life of 
Mohammed recorded their perseverance in idolatry and rebellion: their 
conversion had been reluctant, their elevation irregular and factious, 
and their throne was cemented with the most holy and noble blood of 
Arabia. The best of their race, the pious Omar, was dissatisfied with 
his own title: their personal virtues were insufficient to justify a depar- 
ture from the order of succession; and the eyes and wishes of the faithful 
were turned towards the line of Hashem and the kindred of the apostle 
of God. Of these the Fatimites were either rash or pusillanimous; 
but the descendants of Abbas cherished, with courage and discretion, the 
hopes of their rising fortunes. From an obscure residence in Syria, they 
secretly despatched their agents and missionaries, who preached in the 
Eastern provinces their hereditary indefeasible right; and Mohammed, 
die son of Ali, the son of Abdallah, the son of Abbas, the uncle of the 
prophet, gave audience to the deputies of Chorasan, and accepted their 
free gift of four hundred thousand pieces of gold. After the death of 
Mohammed, the oath of allegiance was administered in the name of his 
son Ibrahim to a numerous band of votaries, who expected only a 
signal and a leader; and the governor of Chorasan continued to deplore 
his fruitless admonitions and the deadly slumber of the caliphs of 
Damascus, till he himself, with all his adherents, was driven from the 
city and palace of Meru by the rebellious arms of Abu Moslem. 88 That 
tnaker of kings, the author, as he is named, of the call of the Abbassides, 
was at length rewarded for his presumption of merit with the usual 
gratitude of courts. A mean, perhaps a foreign, extraction could not 
repress the aspiring energy of Abu Moslem. Jealous of his wives, liberal 
of his wealth, prodigal of his own blood and of that of others, he could 
boast with pleasure, and possibly with truth, that he had destroyed six 
hundred thousand of his enemies; and such was the intrepid gravity of 
his mind and countenance, that he was never seen to smile except on a 
day of battle. In the visible separation of parties, the green was con- 
secrated to the Fatimites; the Ommiades were distinguished by the 
white; and the black, as the most adverse, was naturally adopted by the 
Abbassides. Their turbans and garments were stained with that gloomy 
colour: two black standards, on pike^staves nine cubits long, were 
borne aloft in the van of Abu Moslem; and their allegorical names of 
the night and the shadow obscurely represented the indissoluble union 
and perpetual succession of the line of Hashem. From the Indus to the 
Euphrates, the East was convulsed by the quarrel of the white and the

black factions: the Abbassides were most frequently victorious; but 
their public success was clouded by the personal misfortune of their 
chief. The court of Damascus, awakening from a long slumber, 
resolved to prevent the pilgrimage of Mecca, which Ibrahim had under- 
taken with a splendid retinue, to recommend himself at once to the 
favour of the prophet and of the people. A detachment of cavalry 
intercepted his march and arrested his person; and the unhappy Ibra- 
him, snatched away from the promise of untasted royalty, expired in 
iron fetters in the dungeons of Haran. His two younger brothers, 
Saffah 39 and Almansor, eluded the search, of the tyrant, and lay con- 
cealed at Cufa, till the zeal of the people and the approach of his 
Eastern friends allowed them to expose their persons to the impatient 
public. On Friday, in the dress of a caliph, in the colours of the sect, 
Saffah proceeded with religious and military pomp to the mosch: 
ascending the pulpit, he prayed and preached as the lawful successor 
of Mohammed; and, after his departure, his kinsmen bound a willing 
people by an oath of fidelity. But it was on the banks of the Zab, and 
not in the mosch of Cufa, that this important controversy was deter- 
. mined. -Every advantage appeared to be on the side of the white 
faction: the authority of established government; an army of a hundred 
and twenty thousand soldiers, against a sixth part of that number; and 
the presence and merit of the caliph Mervan, the fourteenth and last 
of the house of Ommiyah. Before his accession to the throne he had 
deserved, by his Georgian warfare, the honourable epithet of the ass 
of Mesopotamia; 40 and he might have been ranked among the greatest 
princes, had not, says Abulfeda, the eternal order decreed that moment 
for the ruin of his family; a decree against which all human prudence 
and fortitude must struggle in vain. The orders of Mervan were mis- 
taken, or disobeyed: the return of his horse, from which he had dis- 
mounted on a necessary occasion, impressed the belief of his death; and 
the enthusiasm of the black squadrons was ably conducted by Abdallah, 
the uncle of his competitor. 41 After an irretrievable defeat, the caliph

ass as a stupid and ignoble emblem (D'Herbelot, Biblioth. Orient p. 55*0-

escaped to Mosul; but the colours of the Abbassides were displayed 
from the rampart; he suddenly repassed the Tigris, cast a melancholy 
look on his palace of Haran, crossed the Euphrates, abandoned the 
fortifications of Damascus, and, without halting in Palestine, pitched his 
last and fatal camp at Busir, on the banks of the Nile. 42 His speed was 
urged by the incessant diligence of Abdallah, who in every step of the 
pursuit acquired strength and reputation: the remains of the white 
faction were finally vanquished in Egypt; and the lance, which ter- 
minated the life and anxiety of Mervan, was not less welcome perhaps 
to the unfortunate than to the victorious chief. The merciless inquisi- 
tion of the conqueror eradicated the most distant branches of the hostile 
race: their bones were scattered, their memory was accursed, and the 
martyrdom of Hossein was abundantly revenged on the posterity of his 
tyrants. Fourscore of the Ommiades, who had yielded to the faith or 
clemency of their foes, were invited to a banquet at Damascus. The 
laws of hospitality were violated by a promiscuous massacre: the board 
was spread over their fallen bodies; and the festivity of the guests 
was enlivened by the music of their dying groans. By the event of the 
civil war the dynasty of the Abbassides was firmly established; but the 
Christians only. could triumph in the mutual hatred and common loss 
of the disciples of Mohammed. 48 

Yet the thousands who were swept away by the sword of war might 
have been speedily retrieved in the succeeding generation, if the conse- 
quences of the revolution had not tended to dissolve the power and unity 
of the empire of the Saracens. In the proscription of the Ommiades, a 
royal youth of the name of Abdalrahman alone escaped the rage of his 

arrived, and which the soldiers were plundering. The army mistook the 
movement for a flight, and immediately commenced a disorderly retreat. 
The commander of the Abassides was Abu Aun, while the Abd Allah who 
pursued Merwan was Al Saffah himself. 0. S.] 

41 Four several places, all in Egypt, bore the name of Busir, or Busiris, so 
famous in Greek fable. The first, where Mervan was slain, was to the 
west of the Nile, in the province of Fium, or Arsinqe; the second in the 
Delta, in the Sebennytic nome ; the third near the Pyramids ; the fourth, which 
was destroyed by Diocletian (see above, vol. i. p. 314), in the Thebais. I

enemies, who hunted the wandering exile from the banks of the Euphrates 
to tie valleys of Mount Altas. His presence in the neighbourhood of 
Spain revived the zeal of the white faction. The name and cause of the 
Abbassides had been first vindicated by the Persians: the West had 
been pure from civil arms; and the servants of the abdicated family 
still held, by a precarious tenure, the inheritance of their lands and the 
offices of government. Strongly prompted by gratitude, indignation, and 
fear, they invited the grandson of the caliph Hashem to ascend the 
throne of his ancestors; and, in his desperate condition, the extremes of 
rashness and prudence were almost the same. The acclamations of the 
people saluted his landing on the coast of Andalusia; and, after a suc- 
cessful struggle, Abdalrahman established the throne of Cordova, and 
was the father of the Ommiades of Spain, who reigned above two hundred 
and fifty years from the Atlantic to the Pyrenees. 44 He slew in battle 
a lieutenant of the Abbassides, who had invaded his dominions with a 
fleet and army: the head of Ala, in salt and camphire, was suspended 
by a daring messenger before the palace of Mecca; and the caliph 
Almansor rejoiced in his safety, that he was removed by seas and lands 
from such a formidable adversary. Their mutual designs or declarations 
of offensive war evaporated without effect; but instead of opening a door 
to the conquest of Europe, Spain was dissevered from the trunk of the 
monarchy, engaged in perpetual hostility with the East, and inclined to 
peace and friendship with the Christian sovereigns of Constantinople and 
France. The example of the Ommiades was imitated by the real or 
fictitious progeny of Ali, the Edrissites of Mauritania, and the more 
powerful Fatimites of Africa and Egypt. In the tenth century the chair 
of Mohammed was disputed by three caliphs or commanders of the 
faithful, who reigned at Bagdad, Cairoan, and Cordova, excommuni- 
cated each other, and agreed only in a principle of discord, that a sectary 
is more odious and criminal than an unbeliever. 45 

Mecca was the patrimony of the line of Hashem, yet the Abbassides 
were never tempted to reside either in the birthplace or the city of 
the prophet. Damascus was disgraced by the choice, and polluted with 
the blood, of the Ommiades; and, after some hesitation, Almansor, the

brother and successor of Saffah, laid the foundations of Bagdad, 40 the 
Imperial seat of his posterity during a reign of five hundred years. 41 
The chosen spot is on the eastern bank of the Tigris, about fifteen miles 
above the ruins of Modain: the double wall was of a circular form; and 
such was the rapid increase of a capital now dwindled to a provincial 
town, that the funeral of a popular saint might be attended by eight 
hundred thousand men and sixty thousand women of Bagdad and the 
adjacent villages. In this city of peace* 3 amidst the riches of the East, 
the Abbassides soon disdained the abstinence and frugality of the first 
caliphs, and aspired to emulate the magnificence of the Persian kings. 
After his wars and buildings, Almansor left behind him in gold and silver 
about thirty millions sterling; 40 and this treasure was exhausted in a 
few years by the vices or virtues of his children. His son Mahadi, in a 
single pilgrimage to Mecca, expended six millions of dinars of gold. A 
pious and charitable motive may sanctify the foundation of cisterns and 
caravanseras, which he distributed along a measured road of seven hun- 
dred miles; but his train of camels, laden with snow, could serve only 
to astonish the natives of Arabia, and to refresh the fruits and liquors 
of the royal banquet. 50 The courtiers would surely praise the liberality 
of his grandson Almamon, who gave away four-fifths of the income of 
a province, a sum of two millions four hundred thousand gold dinars, 
before he drew bis foot from the stirrup. At the nuptials of the same 
prince a thousand pearls of the largest size were showered on the head 

"The geographer D'Anville (1'Euphrate et le Tigre, p. 121-123), and the 
Orientalist D'Herbelot (Bibliotheque, p. 167, 168), may suffice for the knowl- 
edge of Bagdad. Our travellers, Pietro della Valle (torn. i. p. 688-698), 
Tavernier (torn. i. p. 230-238), Thevenot (part ii. p. 209-212), Otter (torn. i. 
p. 162-168), and Niebuhr (Voyage en Arabic, torn. ii. p. 239-271), have seen 
only its decay; and the Nubian geographer (p. 204), and the travelling Jew, 
Benjamin of Tudela (Itinerarium, p. 112-123, a Const. 1'Empereur, apud 
Elzevir, 1633), are the only writers of my acquaintance who have known 
Bagdad under the reign of the Abbassides. 

[Bagdad is divided into two parts by the Tigris. It was originally built 
on the western bank, but as the court removed to the eastern bank in the 
eleventh century, the original city became a kind of suburb, and the quarter 
on the eastern bank the more important. 0. S.]

some dispute concerning the etymology of Bagdad, but the first syllable is

tian hermit, whose cell had been the only habitation on the spot.

of the bride, 81 and a lottery of lands and houses displayed the capricious 
bounty of fortune. The glories of the court were brightened rather than 
impaired in the decline of the empire, and a Greek ambassador might 
admire, or pity, the magnificence of the feeble Moctader. " The caliph's 
whole army," says the historian Abulfeda, " both horse and foot, was 
under arms, which together made a body of one hundred and sixty 
thousand men. His state officers, the favourite slaves, stood near him 
in splendid apparel, their belts glittering with gold and gems. Near 
them were seven thousand eunuchs, four thousand of them white, the 
remainder black. The porters or doorkeepers were in number seven 
hundred. Barges and boats, with the most superb decorations, were seen 
swimming upon the Tigris. Nor was the palace itself less splendid, in 
which were hung up thirty-eight thousand pieces of tapestry, twelve 
thousand five hundred of which were of silk embroidered with gold. 
The carpets on the floor were twenty-two thousand. A hundred lions 
were brought out, with a keeper to each lion. 62 Among the other spec- 
tacles of rare and stupendous luxury was a tree of gold and silver spread- 
ing into eighteen large branches, on which, and on the lesser boughs, sat 
a variety of birds made of the same precious metals, as well as the 
leaves of the tree. While the machinery affected spontaneous motions, 
the several birds warbled their natural harmony. Through this scene of 
magnificence the Greek ambassador was led by the vizir to the foot of 
the caliph's throne." 58 In the West the Ommiades of Spain supported 
with equal pomp the title of commander of the faithful. Three miles 
from Cordova, in honour of his favourite sultana, the third and greatest 
of the Abdalrahmans constructed the city, palace, and gardens of Zehra. 
Twenty-five years, and above three millions sterling, were employed by 
the founder: his liberal taste invited the artists of Constantinople, the 
most skilful sculptors and architects of the age; and the buildings were 
sustained or adorned by twelve hundred columns of Spanish and African^ 
of Greek and Italian marble. The hall of audience was encrusted witb 
gold and pearls, and a great basin in the centre was surrounded with the 
curious and costly figures of birds and quadrupeds. In a lofty pavilion 
of the gardens one of these basins and fountains, so delightful in a

sultry climate, was replenished not with water, but with the purest 
quicksilver. The seraglio of Abdalrahman, his wives, concubines, and 
black eunuchs, amounted to six thousand three hundred persons: and 
he was attended to the field by a guard of twelve thousand horse, whose 
belts and scimitars were studded with gold. 84 

In a private condition our desires are perpetually repressed by poverty 
and subordination; but the lives and labours of millions are devoted to 
the service of a despotic prince, whose laws are blindly obeyed, and 
whose wishes are instantly gratified. Our imagination is dazzled by the 
splendid picture; and whatever may be the cool dictates of reason, there 
are few among us who would obstinately refuse a trial of the comforts 
and the cares of royalty. It may therefore be of some use to borrow 
the experience of the same Abdalrahman, whose magnificence has per- 
haps excited our admiration and envy, and to transcribe an authentic 
memorial which was found in the closet of the deceased caliph. " I have 
now reigned above fifty years in victory or peace; beloved by my 
subjects, dreaded by my enemies, and respected by my allies. Riches 
and honours, power and pleasure, have waited on my call, nor does any 
earthly blessing appear to have been wanting to my felicity. In this 
situation I have diligently numbered the days of pure and genuine 
happiness which have fallen to my lot: they amount to FOURTEEN: 
man! place not thy confidence in this present world! " B6 The luxury 
of the caliphs, so useless to their private happiness, relaxed the nerves, 
and terminated the progress, of the Arabian empire. Temporal and 
spiritual conquest had been the sole occupation of the first successors of 
Mohammed; and after supplying themselves with the necessaries of life, 
the whole revenue was scrupulously devoted to that salutary work. The 
Abbassides were impoverished by the multitude of their wants and their 
contempt of economy. Instead of pursuing the great object of ambition, 
their leisure, their affections, the powers of their mind, were diverted 
by pomp and pleasure: the rewards of valour were embezzled by women 
and eunuchs, and the royal camp was encumbered by the luxury of the 
palace. A similar temper was diffused among the subjects of the caliph. 
Their stern enthusiasm was softened by time and prosperity: they sought 
riches in the occupations of industry, fame in the pursuits, of literature, 

"Caidonne, Histoire de 1'Afrique et de 1'Espagne, torn. i. p." 330-336. A 
just idea of the taste and architecture of the Arabians of Spain may be 
conceived from the description and plates of the Alhambra of Granada (Swin- 
burne's Travels, p. 171-188).

of the vanity of this world (read Prior's verbose but eloquent poem), and 
the happy ten days of the emperor Seghed (Rambler, No. 204, 205), will be 
triumphantly quoted by the detractors of human life. Their expectations 
are commonly immoderate, their estimates are seldom impartial. If I may 
speak of myself (the only person of whom I can speak with certainty), my 
happy hours have far exceeded, and far exceed, the scanty numbers of the 
caliph of Spain; and I shall not scruple to add, that many of them are due 
to tie pleasing labour of the present composition. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE *33 

and happiness in the tranquillity of domestic life. War was no longer 
the passion of the Saracens; and the increase of pay, the repetition of 
donatives, were insufficient to allure the posterity of those voluntary 
champions who had crowded to the standard of Abubeker and Omar 
for the hopes of spoil and of paradise. 

Under the reign of the Ommiades the studies of the Moslems were 
confined to the interpretation of the Koran, and the eloquence and 
poetry of their native tongue. A people continually exposed to the 
dangers of the field must esteem the healing powers of medicine, or 
rather of surgery: but the starving physicians of Arabia murmured 
a complaint that exercise and temperance deprived them of the greatest 
part of then- practice. 50 After their civil and domestic wars, the subjects 
of the Abbassides, awakening from this mental lethargy, found leisure 
and felt curiosity for the acquisition of profane science. This spirit was 
first encouraged by the caliph Almansor, who, besides his knowledge of 
the Mohammedan law, had applied himself with success to the study of 
astronomy. But when the sceptre devolved to Almamon, the seventh 
of the Abbassides, he completed the designs of his grandfather, and in- 
vited the Muses from their ancient seats. His ambassadors at Con- 
stantinople, his agents in Armenia, Syria, and Egypt, collected the vol- 
umes of Grecian science: at his command they were translated by the 
most skilful interpreters into the Arabic language: his subjects were 
exhorted assiduously to peruse these instructive writings; and the suc- 
cessor of Mohammed assisted with pleasure and modesty at the as- 
semblies and disputations of the learned. " He was not ignorant," says 
Abulpharagius, "that they are the elect of God, his best and most 
useful servants, whose lives are devoted to the improvement of their 
rational faculties. The mean ambition of the Chinese or the Turks may 
glory in the industry of their hands or the indulgence of their bruta} 
appetites. Yet these dexterous artists must view, with hopeless emula- 
tion, the hexagons and pyramids of the cells of a beehive: 57 these forti- 
tudinous heroes are awed by the superior fierceness of the lions and 
tigers; and in their amorous enjoyments they are much inferior to the 
vigour of the grossest and most sordid quadrupeds. The teachers of 
wisdom are the true luminaries and legislators of a world, which, with-

out their aid, would again sink in ignorance and barbarism." 5S The zeal 
and curiosity of Ahnamon were imitated by succeeding princes of the 
line of Abbas: their rivals, the Fatimites of Africa and the Ommiades 
of Spain, were the patrons of the learned, as well as the commanders of 
the faithful; the same royal prerogative was claimed by their inde- 
pendent emirs of the provinces; and their emulation diffused the taste 
and the rewards of science from Samarcand and Bochara to Fez and 
Cordova. The vizir of a sultan consecrated a sum of two hundred 
thousand pieces of gold to the foundation of a college at Bagdad, which 
he endowed with an annual revenue of fifteen thousand dinars. The 
fruits of instruction were communicated, perhaps at different times, to 
six thousand disciples of every degree, from the son of the noble to 
that of the mechanic: a sufficient allowance was provided for the in- 
digent scholars; and the merit or industry of the professors was repaid 
with adequate stipends. In every city the productions of Arabic litera- 
ture were copied and collected by the curiosity of the studious and the 
vanity of the rich. A private doctor refused the invitation of the sultan 
of Bochara, because the carriage of his books would have required four 
hundred camels. The royal library of the Fatimites consisted of one 
hundred thousand manuscripts, elegantly transcribed arid splendidly 
bound, which were lent, without jealousy or avarice, to the students of 
Cairo, Yet this collection; must appear moderate, if we can believe 
that the Ommiades of Spain had formed a library of six hundred thou- 
sand volumes, forty-four of which were employed in the mere catalogue. 
Their capital, Cordova, with the adjacent towns of Malaga, Alnieria, 
and Murcia, had given birth to 'more than three hundred writers, and 
above seventy public libraries were opened in the cities of the Andalu- 
sian kingdom. The age of Arabian learning continued about five hundred 
years, till the great eruption of the Moguls, and was coeval with the 
darkest and most slothful period of European annals; but since the 
sun of science has arisen in the West, it should seem that the Oriental 
studies have languished and declined. 60 

In the libraries of the Arabians, as in those of Europe, the far greater 
part of . the innumerable volumes, were , possessed only of local value 
or imaginary merit. 80 The shelves were crowded with orators and poets,

with the text of Pocock's Specimen Historic Arabum. A number of literary 
anecdotes of philosophers, physicians, etc., who have flourished under each 
caliph, form the principal merit of the Dynasties of Abulpharagius.

whose style was adapted to the taste and manners of their countrymen; 
with general and partial histories, which each revolving generation sup- 
plied with a new harvest of persons and events; with codes and com- 
mentaries of jurisprudence which derived their authority from the law of 
the prophet; with the interpreters of the Koran, and orthodox tradition; 
and with the whole theological tribe, polemics, mystics, scholastics, and 
moralists, the first or the last of writers, according to the different esti- 
mates of sceptics or believers. The works of speculation or science may 
be reduced to the four classes of philosophy, mathematics, astronomy^ 
and physic. The sages of Greece were translated and illustrated in th* 
Arabic language, and some treatises, now lost in the original, have been 
recovered in the versions of the East, 61 which possessed and studied the 
writings of Aristotle and Plato, of Euclid and Apollonius, of Ptolemy, 
Hippocrates, and Galen. 62 Among the ideal systems which have varied 
with the fashion of the times, the Arabians adopted the philosophy of 
the Stagirite, alike intelligible or alike obscure for the readers of every 
age. Plato wrote for the Athenians, and his allegorical genius is too 
closely blended with the. language and religion of Greece. After the fall 
of that religion, the Peripatetics, emerging from their obscurity, pre- 
vailed in the controversies of the Oriental sects, and their founder was 
long afterwards restored by the Mohammedans of Spain to the T-atfa 
schools.* 8 The physics, both of the Academy and the Lycaeum, as they 
are built, not on observation but on argument, have retarded the progress 
of real knowledge. The metaphysics of infinite, or finite, spirit, have 
too often been enlisted in the service of superstition. But the human 
faculties are fortified by the art and practice of dialectics; the ten 
predicaments of Aristotle collect and methodise our ideas," and his 
syllogism is the keenest weapon of dispute. It was dexterously wielded 

tt As for instance, the fifth, sixth, and seventh books (the eighth is still 
wanting) of the Conic Sections of Apollonius Pergaeus, which were printed 
from the Florence MS. 1661 (Fabric. Biblioth. Grsec. torn. iL p. 559). Yet 
the fifth book had been previously restored by the mathematical divination 
of Viviani (see his Eloge in Fpntenelle, torn. v. p. 59, etc.). 

"'The merit of these Arabic versions is freely discussed by Renaudot 
(Fabric. Biblioth. Grace, torn. i. p. 812-816), and piously defended by Casiri 
(Biblioth. Arab. Hispana, torn. i. p. 238-240). Most of the versions of Plato-, 
Aristotle, Hippocrates, Galen, etc^ are ascribed to Honain, a physician of the 
Nestorian sect, who flourished at Bagdad in the court of the caliphs, and 
died AJD. 876. He was at the head of a school or manufacture of translations, 
and the works of his sons and disciples were published under his name.

in the schools of the Saracens, but, as it is more effectual for the detec- 
tion of error than for the investigation of truth, it is not surprising that 
new generations of masters and disciples should still revolve in the same 
cirde of logical argument. The mathematics are distinguished by a 
peculiar privilege, that, in the course of ages, they may always advance 
and can never recede. But the ancient geometry, if I am not misin- 
formed, was resumed in the same state by the Italians of the fifteenth 
century; and whatever may be the origin of the name, the science of 
algebra is ascribed to the Grecian Diophantus by the modest testimony 
of the Arabs themselves. 66 They cultivated with more success the sublime 
science of astronomy, which elevates the mind of man to disdain his 
diminutive planet and momentary existence. The costly instruments of 
observation were supplied by the caliph Almamon, and the land of the 
Chaldeans still afforded the same spacious level, and the same unclouded 
horizon. In the plains of Sinaar, and a second time in those of Cufa, 
his mathematicians accurately measured a degree of the great circle of 
the earth, and determined at twenty-four thousand miles the entire cir- 
cumference of our globe. 66 From the reign of the Abbassides to that 
of the grand-children of Tamerlane, the stars, without the aid of glasses, 
were diligently observed; and the astronomical tables of Bagdad, Spain, 
and Samarcand 67 correct some minute errors, without daring to renounce 
the hypothesis of Ptolemy, without advancing a step towards the dis- 
covery of the solar system. In the eastern courts, the truths of science 
could be recommended only by ignorance and folly, and the astronomer 
would have been disregarded, had he not debased his wisdom or honesty 
by the vain predictions of astrology. 68 But in the science of medicine 
the Arabians have been deservedly applauded. The names of Mesua 
and Geber, of Razis and Avicenna, are ranked with- the Grecian Piasters; 
in the city of Bagdad eight hundred and sixty physicians were licensed

to exercise their lucrative profession: 89 in Spain, the life of the Catholic 
princes was intrusted to the skill of the Saracens, 70 and the school of 
Salerno, their legitimate offspring, revived in Italy and Europe the pre- 
cepts of the healing art. 71 The success of each professor must have 
been influenced by personal and accidental causes; but we may form a 
less fanciful estimate of their general knowledge of anatomy, 72 botany, 7 * 
and chemistry, 7 * the threefold basis of their theory and practice. A 
superstitious reverence for the dead confined both the Greeks and the 
Arabians to the dissection of apes and quadrupeds; the more solid and 
visible parts were known in the time of Galen, and the finer scrutiny 
of the human frame was reserved for the microscope and the injections 
of modern artists. Botany is an active science, and the discoveries of the 
torrid zone might enrich the herbal of Dioscorides with two thousand 
plants. Some traditionary knowledge might be secreted in the temples 
and monasteries of Egypt; much useful experience had been acquired 
in the practice of arts and manufactures; but the science of chemistry 
owes its origin and improvement to the industry of the Saracens. They 
first invented and named the alembic for the purposes of distillation, 
analysed the substances of the three kingdoms of nature, tried the dis- 
tinction and affinities of alcalis and acids, and converted the poisonous 
minerals into soft and salutary medicines. But the most eager search 
of Arabian chemistry was the transmutation of metals, and the elixir 
of immortal health: the reason and the fortunes of thousands were 
evaporated in the crucibles of alchymy, and the consummation of the 
great work was promoted by the worthy aid of mystery, fable, and 
superstition. 

But the Moslems deprived themselves of the principal benefits of a 
familiar intercourse with Greece and Rome, the knowledge of antiquity, 
the purity of taste, and the freedom of thought. Confident in the riches

sages. Whatever might be the origin or extent of their knowledge, the arts

of their native tongue, the Arabians disdained the study of any foreign 
idiom. The Greek interpreters were chosen among their Christian sub- 
jects; they formed their translations sometimes on the original text, 
more frequently perhaps on a Syriac version: and in the crowd of 
astronomers and physicians there is no example of a poet, an orator, 
or even an historian, being taught to speak the language of the Sara- 
cens. 75 The mythology of Homer would have provoked the abhorrence 
of those stern fanatics: they possessed in lazy ignorance the colonies of 
the Macedonians, and the provinces of Carthage and Rome: the heroes 
of Plutarch and Livy were buried in oblivion; and the history of the 
world before Mohammed was reduced to a short legend of the patri- 
archs, the prophets, and the Persian kings. Our education in the Greek 
and Latin schools may have fixed in our minds a standard of exclusive 
taste; and I am not forward to condemn the literature and judgment 
of nations of whose language I am ignorant. Yet I know that the classics 
have much to teach, and I believe that the Orientals have much to learn: 
the temperate dignity of style, the graceful proportions of art, the 
forms of visible and intellectual beauty, the just delineation of char- 
acter and passion, the rhetoric of narrative and argument, the regular 
fabric of epic and dramatic poetry/ 6 The influence of truth and reason 
is of a less ambiguous complexion. The philosophers of Athens and 
Rome enjoyed the blessings, and asserted the rights, of civil and re- 
ligious freedom. Their moral and political writings might have gradu- 
ally unlocked the fetters of Eastern despotism, diffused a liberal spirit 
of inquiry and toleration, and encouraged the Arabian sages to suspect 
that their caliph was a tyrant, and their prophet an impostor. 77 The 
instinct of superstition was aiarmed by the introduction even of the 
abstract sciences; and the more rigid doctors of the law condemned the 
rash and pernicious curiosity of Almamon. 78 To the thirst of martyr- 
dom, the vision of paradise, and the belief of predestination, we must 
ascribe the invincible enthusiasm of the prince and people. And the 
sword of the Saracens became less formidable when their youth was 
drawn away from the camp to the college, when the armies of the faith- 

"Abulpharagius (Dynast p. 26, 148) mentions a Syriac version of Homer's 
two poems, by, Theophilus, a Christian Maronite of Mount Libanus, who 
professed astronomy at Roha or Edessa towards ,th.e end of the eighth cen- 
tury. His work would be a literary curiosity. I have read somewhere, but 
I do not believe, that Plutarch's Lives were translated into Turkish for the 
use of Mohammed the Second.

tary on Asiatic Poetry (London, 1774, in octavo), which was composed in

and judgment, he would perhaps abate of the fervent and even partial praise 
which he has bestowed on the Orientals.

the religions of the Jews, the Christians, and the Mohammedans (see his 
article in Bayle's Dictionary). Each of these sects. would agree that, in two 
instances out of three, his contempt was reasonable.

ful presumed to read and to reflect. Yet the foolish vanity of the Greeks 
was jealous of their studies, and reluctantly imparted the sacred fire to 
the barbarians of the East. 79 

In the bloody conflict of the Ommiades and Abbassides the Greeks 
had stolen the opportunity of avenging their wrongs and enlarging their 
limits. But a severe retribution was exacted by Mohadi, the third caliph 
of the new dynasty, who seized, in his turn, the favourable opportunity, 
while a woman and a child, Irene and Constantine, were seated on the 
Byzantine throne. An army of ninety-five thousand Persians and Arabs 
was sent from the Tigris to the Thracian Bosphorus, under the command 
of Harun, 80 or Aaron, the second son of the commander of the faithful. 
His encampment on the opposite heights of Chrysopolis, or Scutari, in- 
formed Irene, in her palace of Constantinople, of the loss of her troops 
and provinces. With the consent or connivance of their sovereign, her 
ministers subscribed an ignominious peace; and the exchange of some 
royal gifts could not disguise the annual tribute of seventy thousand 
dinars of gold, which was imposed on the Roman empire. The Saracens 
had too rashly advanced into the midst of a distant and hostile land; 
their retreat was solicited by the promise of faithful guides and plentiful 
markets; and not a Greek had courage to whisper that their weary 
forces might be surrounded and destroyed in their necessary passage be- 
tween a slippery mountain and the river Sangarius. Five years after 
this expedition, Harun ascended the throne of his father and his elder 
brother; the most powerful and vigorous monarch of his race, illustrious 
in the West as the ally of Charlemagne, and familiar to the most childish 
readers as the perpetual hero of the Arabian tales. His title to the 
name of Al Rashid (the Just) is sullied by the extirpation of the gen- 
erous, perhaps the innocent, Barmecides: 81 yet he could listen to the

to the instances and offers of the caliph Almamon. This absurd scruple is 
expressed almost in the same words by the continuator of Theophanes (Scrip- 
tores post Theophanem, p. 118 [ed. Par.; p. 190, ed Bonn]). 

80 See the reign and character of Harun al Rashid in the Bibliotheque 
Orientale, p. 431-433, under his proper title, and in the relative articles to 
which M. D'Herbelot refers. That learned collector has shown much taste 
in stripping the Oriental chronicles of their instructive and amusing anec- 
dotes. 

tt [There seem to be grounds for believing that Haroun Al Rashjd's cruelty 
towards the Barmecides was connected with his incestuous passion for his 
sister Abbasah. Haroun's fondness for Djafar (or Giafar), one of the 
Barmecide family, was so great that he not only made him his grand vizier, 
but loved him so extravagantly that he was never happy out of his company. 
and in order to reconcile his presence in the harem with Eastern notions of 
decorum, he made him contract a formal marriage with Abbasah, but under 
strict injunctions that he was not to exercise the rights of a husband. A 
mutual passion, however, caused the wedded pair to overstep these commands, 
a child was the fruit of their stolen interviews, and Haroun learned from 
a slave that he was deceived and disobeyed. After satisfying himself of

complaint of a poor widow who had been pillaged by his troops, and 
who dared, in a passage of the Koran, to threaten the inattentive despot 
with the judgment of God and posterity. His court was adorned with 
luxury and science; but, in a reign of three-and-twenty years, Harun 
repeatedly visited his provinces from Chorasan to Egypt; nine times he 
performed the pilgrimage of Mecca; eight times he invaded the terri- 
tories of the Romans; and as often as they declined the payment of the 
tribute, they were taught to feel that a month of depredation was more 
costly than a year of submission. But when the unnatural mother of 
Constantino was deposed and banished, her successor, Nicephorus, re- 
solved to obliterate this badge of servitude and disgrace. The epistle 
of the emperor to the caliph was pointed with an allusion to the game 
of chess, which had already spread from Persia to Greece. " The queen 
(he spoke of Irene) considered you as a rook, and herself as a pawn. 
That pusillanimous female submitted to pay a tribute, the double of 
which she ought to have exacted from the barbarians. Restore therefore 
the fruits of your injustice, or abide the determination of the sword." 
At these words the ambassadors cast a bundle of swords before the foot 
of the throne. The caliph smiled at the menace, and, drawing his 
scimitar, samsamah, a weapon of historic or fabulous renown, he cut 
asunder the feeble arms of the Greeks, without turning the edge or 
endangering the temper of his blade. He then dictated an epistle of 
tremendous brevity: " In the name of the most merciful God, Harun al 
Rashid, commander of the faithful, to Nicephorus, the Roman dog. I 
have read thy letter, O thou son of an unbelieving mother. Thou shalt 
not hear, thou shalt behold, my reply." It was written in characters of 
blood and fire on the plains of Phrygia; and the war-like celerity of 
the Arabs could only be checked by the arts of deceit and the show of 
repentance. The triumphant caliph retired, after the fatigues of the 
campaign, to his favourite palace of Racca on the Euphrates: 82 but the 
distance of five hundred miles, and the inclemency of the season, en- 
couraged his adversary to violate the peace. Nicephorus was astonished 
by the bold and rapid march of the commander of the faithful, who 
repassed, in the depth of winter, the snows of Mount Taurus: his 
stratagems of policy and war were exhausted; and the perfidious Greek 
escaped with three wounds from a field of battle overspread with forty 
thousand of his subjects. 88 Yet the emperor was ashamed of submission, 

the truth of this report by the likeness which the child bore its father, 
Haroun resolved on the destruction of the whole family of the Barmecides. 
They were treacherously seized and murdered; Djafar was beheaded, and 
parts of his mutilated body were fixed to the gates and on the bridge at 
Bagdad. O. S.] 

^For the situation of Racca, the old Nicephorium, consult D'Anville 
(1'Euphrate et le Tigre, p. 24-27). The Arabian Nights represent Harun 
al Rashid as almost stationary in Bagdad. He respected the royal seat of 
the Abbassides; but the vices of the inhabitants had driven him from the 
city (Abulfed. Annal. p. 167). 

&amp; [Haroun invaded Asia Minor twice in A.D. 803. On the first occasion

and the caliph was resolved on victory. One hundred and thirty-five 
thousand regular soldiers received pay, and were inscribed in the mili- 
tary roll; and above three hundred thousand persons of every denom- 
ination marched under the black standard of the Abbassides. They 
swept the surface of Asia Minor far beyond Tyana and Ancyra, and 
invested the Pontic Heraclea, 84 once a flourishing state, now a paltry 
town; at that time capable of sustaining, in her antique walls, a month's 
siege against the forces of the East. The ruin was complete, the spoil 
was ample; but if Harun had been conversant with Grecian story, he 
would have regretted the statue of Hercules, whose attributes, the club, 
the bow, the quiver, and the lion's hide, were sculptured in massy gold* 
The progress of desolation by sea and land, from the Euxine to the isle 
of Cyprus, compelled the emperor Nicephorus to retract his haughty 
defiance. In the new treaty, the ruins of Heraclea were left for ever 
as a lesson and a trophy: and the coin of the tribute was marked with 
the image and superscription of Harun and his three sons. 85 Yet this 
plurality. of lords might contribute to remove the dishonour of the 
Roman name. After the death of their father, the heirs of the caliph 
were involved in civil discord, and the conqueror, the liberal Almamon, 
was sufficiently engaged in the restoration of domestic peace and the 
introduction of foreign .science. 

Under the reign of Almamon at Bagdad, of Michael the Stammerer 
at Constantinople, the islands of Crete se said Sicily were subdued by 
the Arabs. The former of these conquests is disdained by their own 
writers, who were ignorant of the fame of Jupiter and Minos, but it has 
not been overlooked by the Byzantine historians, who now begin to 
cast a clearer light on the affairs of their own times. 87 A band of Anda- 

the promise of tribute induced him to retreat, but when the tribute was not 
paid he repassed the Taurus at the end of the year to demand it. The

depredations; they saw, they envied, they tasted the fertility of Crete, 
and soon returned with forty galleys to a more serious attack. The 
Andalusians wandered over the land fearless and unmolested; but when 
they descended with their plunder to the sea-shore, their vessels were in 
flames, and their chief, Abu Caab, confessed himself the author of the

appealed to the reason and policy of the Saracens of Africa; and soon 
returned with the Imperial purple, a fleet of one hundred ships, and an 
army of seven hundred horse and ten thousand foot They landed at 
Mazara, near the ruins of the ancient Setinus; but after some partial 
victories, Syracuse 00 was delivered by the Greeks, the apostate was 
slain before her walls, and his African friends were reduced to the 
necessity of feeding on the flesh of their own horses. In their turn they 
were relieved by a powerful reinforcement of their brethren of Anda- 
lusia; the largest and western part of the island was gradually reduced, 
and the commodious harbour of Palermo was chosen for the seat of the 
naval and military power of the Saracens. Syracuse preserved about 
fifty years the faith which she had sworn to Christ and to Caesar. In 
the last and fatal siege ier citizens displayed some remnant of 'he 
spirit which had formerly resisted the powers of Athens and Carthage. 
They stood above twenty days against the battering-rams and catapulte, 
the mines and tortoises of the besiegers; and the {dace might have been 
relieved, if the mariners of the Imperial fleet had not been detained at 
Constantinople in building a church to the Virgin Maiy. The deacon 
Theodosius, with the bishop and clergy, was dragged in chains from the 
altar to Palermo, cast into a subterraneous dungeon, and exposed to 
the hourly peril of death or apostasy. His pathetic, and not inelegant 
complaint, may be read as the epitaph of his country.* 1 From the 
Roman conquest to this final calamity, Syracuse, now dwindled to thft 
primitive isle of Ortygea, had insensibly declined. Yet the relics were 
still precious; the plate of the cathedral weighed five thousand pounds 
of silver; the entire spoil was computed at one million of pieces of gold 
{about four hundred thousand pounds sterling), and the captives most 
outnumber the seventeen thousand Christians who were transported from 
the sack of Tauromenium into African servitude. In Sicily the religion 
and language of the Greeks were eradicated; and stich was the docility 
of the rising generation, that fifteen thousand boys were circumcised and 
clothed on the same day with the son of the Fatimite caliph. The

Arabian squadrons issued from the harbours of Palermo, Biserta, and^ 
Tunis; a hundred and fifty towns of Calabria and Campania were at- 
tacked and pillaged, nor could the suburbs of Rome be defended by 
the name of the Caesars and apostles. Had the Mohammedans been 
united, Italy must have fallen an easy and glorious accession to the 
empire of the prophet. But the caliphs of Bagdad had lost their authority 
in the West; the Aglabites and Fatimites usurped the provinces of 
Africa, their emirs of Sicily aspired to independence; and the design 
of conquest and dominion was degraded to a repetition of predatory 
inroads. 02 

In the sufferings of prostrate Italy the name of Rome awakens a solemn 
and mournful recollection, A fleet of Saracens from the African coast 
presumed to enter the mouth of the Tiber, and to approach a city 
which even yet, in her fallen state, was revered as the metropolis of the 
Christian world. The gates and ramparts were guarded by a trembling 
people; but the tombs and temples of St. Peter and St. Paul were left 
-exposed in the suburbs of the Vatican and of the Ostian way. Their 
invisible sanctity had protected them against the Goths, the Vandals, 
and the Lombards; but the Arabs disdained both the Gospel and the 
&lt;egend; and their rapacious spirit was approved and animated by the 
precepts of the Koran. The Christian idols were stripped of their costly 
offerings; a silver altar was torn away from the shrine of St. Peter; 
and if the bodies or the buildings were left entire, their deliverance 
must be imputed to the haste rather than the scruples of the Saracens. 
In their course along the Appian way, they pillaged Fundi and besieged 
Gaeta; but they had turned aside from the walls of Rome, and, by their 
divisions, the Capitol was saved from the yoke of the prophet of Mecca. 
The same danger still impended on the heads of the Roman people; 
and their domestic force was unequal to the assault of an African emir. 
They claimed the protection of their Latin sovereign; but the Carlo- 
vingian standard was overthrown by a detachment of the barbarians: 
they meditated the restoration of the Greek emperors; but the attempt 
was treasonable, and the succour remote and precarious. 9 * Their distress 
appeared to receive some aggravation from the death of their spiritual 
and temporal chief; but the pressing emergency superseded the forms 
and intrigues of an election; and the unanimous choice of Pope Leo 
the Fourth 9 * was the safety of the church and city. This pontiff was

born a Roman; the courage of the first ages of the republic glowed in 
his breast; and, amidst the ruins of his country, he stood erect, like 
one of the firm and lofty columns that rear their heads above the frag- 
ments of the Roman forum. The first days of his reign were consecrated 
to the purification and removal of relics, to prayers and processions, 
and to all the solemn offices of religion, which served at least to heal 
the imagination and restore the hopes of the multitude. The public 
defence had been long neglected, not from the presumption of peace, 
but from the distress and poverty of the times. As far as the scantiness 
of his means and the shortness of his leisure would allow, the ancient 
walls were repaired by the command of Leo; fifteen towers, in the most 
accessible stations, were built or renewed; two of these commanded on 
either side the Tiber; and an iron chain was drawn across the stream 
to impede the ascent of a hostile navy. The Romans were assured of a 
short respite by the welcome news that the siege of Gaeta had been 
raised, and that a part of the enemy with their sacrilegious plunder had 
perished in the waves. 

But the storm which had been delayed soon burst upon them with 
redoubled violence. The Aglabite, 95 who reigned in Africa, had inher- 
ited from his father a treasure and an army: a fleet of Arabs and Moors, 
after a short refreshment in the harbours of Sardinia, cast anchor before 
the mouth of the Tiber, sixteen miles from the city; and their discipline 
and numbers appeared to threaten, not a transient inroad, but a serious 
design of conquest and dominion. But the vigilance of Leo had formed 
an alliance with the vassals of the Greek empire, the free and maritime 
states of Gaeta, Naples, and Amalfi; and, in the hour of danger, their 
galleys appeared in the port of Ostia under the command of Caesarius, 
the son of the Neapolitan duke, a noble and valiant youth, who had 
already vanquished the fleets of the Saracens. With his principal com- 
panions, Caesarius was invited to the Lateran palace, and the dexterous 
pontiff affected to inquire their errand, and to accept with joy and 
surprise their providential succour. The city bands, in arms, attended 
their father to Ostia, where he reviewed and blessed his generous 
deliverers. They kissed his feet, received the communion with martial 
devotion, and listened to the prayer of Leo, that the same God who had 
supported St. Peter and St. Paul on the waves of the sea would 
strengthened the hands of his champions against the adversaries of his 
holy name. After a similar prayer, and with equal resolution, the 
Moslems advanced to the attack of the Christian galleys, which pre- 
served their advantageous station along the coast. The victory in- 
struck with the character of Pope Leo IV. I have borrowed his general 
expression, but the sight of the forum has furnished me with a more distinct 
and lively image.

246 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

dined to the side of the allies, when it was less gloriously decided 
in their favour by a sudden tempest, which confounded the skill and 
courage of the stoutest mariners. The Christians were sheltered in a 
friendly harbour, while the Africans were scattered and dashed in pieces 
among the rocks and islands of a hostile shore. Those who escaped from 
shipwreck and hunger neither found nor deserved mercy at the hands 
of their implacable pursuers. The sword and the gibbet reduced the 
dangerous multitude of captives; and the remainder was more usefully 
employed to restore the sacred edifices which they had attempted to 
subvert. The pontiff, at the head of the citizens and 'allies, paid his 
grateful devotion at the shrines of the apostles; and, among the spoils 
of this naval victory, thirteen Arabian bows of pure and massy silver 
were suspended round the altar of the fisherman of Galilee. The reign 
of Leo the Fourth was employed in the defence and ornament of the 
Roman state. The churches were renewed and embellished: near four 
thousand pounds of silver were consecrated to repair the losses of St. 
Peter; and his sanctuary was decorated with a plate of gold of the 
weight of two hundred and sixteen pounds, embossed with the portraits 
of the pope and emperor, and encircled with a string of pearls. Yet 
this vain magnificence reflects less glory on the character of Leo than 
the paternal care with which he rebuilt the walls of Horta and Ameria; 
and transported the wandering inhabitants of Centumcdlse to his new 
foundation of Leopolis, twelve miles from the sea-shore. 9 * By his 
liberality a colony of Corsicans, with their wives and children, was 
planted in the station of Porto at the mouth of the Tiber: the falling 
city was restored for their use, the fields and vineyards were divided 
among the new settlers: their first efforts were assisted by a gift of 
horses and cattle; and the hardy exiles, who breathed revenge against 
the Saracens, swore to live and die under the standard of St. Peter. 
The nations of the West and North who visited the threshold of the 
apostles had gradually formed the large. and populous suburb of the 
Vatican, and their various habitations were distinguished, in the lan- 
guage of the times, as the schools of the Greeks and Goths, of the Lom- 
bards and Saxons. But this venerable spot was still open to sacrilegious 
insult: the design of enclosing it with walls and towers exhausted all 
that authority could command, or charity would supply: and the pious 
labour of four years was animated in every season and at every hour by 
the presence of the indefatigable pontiff. The love of fame, a generous 
but worldly passion, may be detected in the name of the Leonine city, 
which he bestowed on the Vatican; yet the pride of the dedication was 
tempered with Christian penance and humility. The boundary was trod 
by the bishop and his clergy, barefoot, in sackcloth and ashes; the 
songs of triumph were modulated to psalms and litanies; the walls were

THE ROMAN EMPIRE 247 

besprinkled with holy water; and the ceremony was concluded with a 
prayer, that, under the guardian care of the apostles and the angelic 
host, both the old and the new Rome might ever be preserved pure, 
prosperous, and impregnable. 97 

The emperor Theophilus, son of Michael the Stammerer, was one of 
the most active and high-spirited princes who reigned at Constantinople 
during the middle age. In offensive or defensive war he marched in 
person five times against the Saracens, formidable in his attack, esteemed 
by the enemy in his losses and defeats. In the last of these expeditions 
he penetrated into Syria, and besieged the obscure town of Sozopetra; 
the casual birthplace of the caliph Motassem, whose father Harun was 
attended in peace or war by the most favoured of his wives and con- 
cubines. The revolt of a Persian impostor employed at that moment 
the arms of the Saracen, and he could only intercede in favour of a 
place for which he felt and acknowledged some degree of filial affection. 
These solicitations determined the emperor to wound his pride in so 
sensible a part. Sozopetra was levelled with the ground, the Syrian 
prisoners were marked or mutilated with ignominious cruelty, and a 
thousand female captives were forced away from the adjacent territory. 
Among these a matron of the house of Abbas invoked, in an agony of 
despair, the name of Motassem; and the insults of the Greeks engaged 
the honour of her kinsman to avenge his indignity, and to answer her 
appeal. Under the reign of the two elder brothers, the inheritance of 
the youngest had been confined to Anatolia, Armenia, Georgia, and 
Circassia; this frontier station had exercised his military talents; and 
among his accidental claims to the name of Octonary?* the most meri- 
torious are the eight battles which he gained or fought against the 
enemies of the Koran. In this personal quarrel, the troops of Irak, 
Syria, and Egypt were recruited from the tribes of Arabia and the 
Turkish hordes: his cavalry might be numerous, though we should 
deduct some myriads from the hundred and thirty thousand horses of 
the royal stables; and the expense of the armament was computed at 
four millions sterling, or one hundred thousand pounds of gold. From 
Tarsus, the place of assembly, the Saracens advanced in three divisions 
along the high road of Constantinople: Motassem himself commanded 
the centre, and the vanguard was given to his son Abbas, who, in the 

OT The Arabs and the Greeks are alike silent concerning the invasion of 
Rome by the Africans. The Latin chronicles do not afford much instruction 
(see the Annals of Baronius and Pagi). Our authentic and contemporary 
guide for the Popes of the ninth century is Anastasius, librarian of the 
Roman church. His Life of Leo IV. contains twenty-four pages (p. 175- 
199, edit Paris) ; and if a great part consists of superstitious trifles, we must 
blame or commend his hero, who was much oftener in a church than in a 
camp. 

" *The same number was applied to the following circumstance in the life 
of Motassem: he was the eighth of the Abbassides; he reigned eight years, 
eight months, and eight days; left eight sons, eight daughters, eight thousand 
slaves, eight millions of gold. 



248 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

trial of the first adventures, might succeed with the more glory, or fail 
vrith the least reproach. In the revenge of his injury the caliph pre- 
pared to retaliate a similar affront. The father of Theophilus was a 
native of Amorium 99 in Phrygia: the original seat of the Imperial 
house had been adorned with privileges and monuments; and, whatever 
might be the indifference of the people, Constantinople itself was scarcely 
of more value in the eyes of the sovereign and his court. The name of 
AMORIUM was inscribed on the shields of the Saracens; and their three 
armies were again united under the walls of the devoted city. It had been 
proposed by the wisest counsellors to evacuate Amorium, to remove the 
inhabitants, and to abandon the empty structures to the vain resentment 
of the barbarians. The emperor embraced the more generous resolution 
of defending, in a siege and battle, the country of his ancestors. When 
the armies drew near, the front of the Mohammedan line appeared to 
a Roman eye more dosely planted with spears and javelins; but the 
event of the action was not glorious on either side to the national 
troops. The Arabs were broken, but it was by the swords of thirty 
thousand Persians, who had obtained service and settlement in the 
Byzantine empire. The Greeks were repulsed and vanquished, but it 
was by the arrows of the Turkish cavalry; and had not their bowstrings 
been damped and relaxed by the evening rain, very few of the Chris- 
tians could have escaped with the emperor from the field of battle. 
They breathed at Dorylseum, at the distance of three days; and The- 
ophilus, reviewing his trembling squadrons, forgave the common flight 
both of the prince and people. After this discovery of his weakness, 
he vainly hoped to deprecate the fate of Amorium: the inexorable caliph 
rejected with contempt his prayers and promises, and detained the 
Roman ambassadors to be the witnesses of his great revenge. They 
had nearly been the witnesses of his shame. The vigorous assaults 
of fifty-five days were encountered by a faithful governor, a veteran 
garrison, and a desperate people; and the Saracens must have raised 
the siege, if a domestic traitor had not pointed to the weakest part of 
the wall, a place which was decorated with the statues of a lion and a 
bull. The vow of Motassem was accomplished with unrelenting rigour: 
tired, rather than satiated, with destruction, he returned to his new 
palace of Samara, in the neighbourhood of Bagdad, while the unfor- 
tunate 10 Theophilus implored the tardy and doubtful aid of his Western 

99 Amorium is seldom mentioned by the old geographers, and totally for- 
gotten in the Roman Itineraries. After the sixth century it became an 
episcopal see, and at length the metropolis of the new Galatia (Carol. Scto. 
Paulo, Geograph. Sacra, p. 234). The city rose again from its ruins, if we 
should read Ammurio, not Anguria, in the text of the Nubian geographer 
(p. 236). 

100 In the East he was styled Avtrrvxfa (Continuator Theophan. L iii. p. 84 
[p. 135, ed. Bonn]) ^ but such was the ignorance of the West, that his 
ambassadors, in public discourse, might boldly narrate, 'de victoriis, quas 
adversus exteras bellando gentes ccelitus fuerat assecutus (Annalist. Bertinian. 
apud Pagi, torn. iii. p. 720). 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 249 

rival the emperor of the Franks. Yet in the siege of Amorium about 
seventy thousand Moslems had perished; their loss had been revenged 
by the slaughter of thirty thousand Christians, and the sufferings of an 
equal number of captives, who were treated as the most atrocious 
criminals. Mutual necessity could sometimes extort the exchange or 
ransom of prisoners; 101 but in the national and religious conflict of the 
two empires, peace was without confidence, and war without mercy. 
Quarter was seldom given in the field; those who escaped the edge of the 
sword were condemned to hopeless servitude or exquisite torture; and a 
Catholic emperor relates, with visible satisfaction, the execution of the 
Saracens of Crete, who were flayed alive, or plunged into caldrons of 
boiling oil. 102 To a point of honour Motassem had sacrificed a flourish- 
ing city, two hundred thousand lives, and the property of millions. The 
same caliph descended from his horse, and dirtied his robe, to relieve 
the distress of a decrepit old man, who, with his laden ass, had tumbled 
into a ditch. On which of these actions did he reflect with the most 
pleasure when he was summoned by the angel of death? 103 

With Motassem, the eighth of the Abbassides, the glory of his family 
and nation expired. When the Arabian conquerors had spread them- 
selves over the East, and were mingled with the servile crowds of Persia, 
Syria, and Egypt, they insensibly lost the freeborn and martial virtues 
of the desert. The courage of the South is the artificial fruit of discipline 
and prejudice; the active power of enthusiasm had decayed, and the 
mercenary forces of the caliphs were recruited in those climates of 
the North, of which valour is the hardy and spontaneous production. 
Of the Turks 10 * who dwelt beyond the Oxus and Jaxartes, the robust 
youths, either taken in war, or purchased in trade, were educated in 

^Abulpharagius (Dynast, p. 167, 168) relates one of these singular trans- 
actions on the bridge of the river Lamus in Cilicia, the limit of the two 
empires, and one day's journey westward of Tarsus (D*Anville, Geographic 
Antienne, torn, ii p. 91). Four thousand four hundred and sixty Moslems, 
eight hundred women and children, one hundred confederates, were exchanged 
for an equal number of Greeks. They passed each other in the middle of 
the bridge, and when they reached their respective friends they shouted 
Allah Acbar, and Kyrie Eleison. Many of the prisoners of Amorium were 
probably among them, but in the same year (A.H. 231) the most illustrious 
of them, the forty-two martyrs, were beheaded by the caliph's orders. 

^Constantin. Porphyrogenitus, in Vit. Basil, c. 61, p. 186 [p. 301, ed-

and renegadoes.

divided into fifteen hordes, from China and Siberia to the dominions of the

the exercises of the field and the profession of the Mohammedan faith. 
The Turkish guards stood in arms round the throne of their benefactor, 
and their chiefs usurped the dominion of the palace and the provinces, 
Motassem, the first author of this dangerous example, .introduced into 
the capital above fifty thousand Turks: their licentious conduct pro- 
voked the public indignation, and the quarrels of the soldiers and people 
induced the caliph to retire from Bagdad, and establish his own residence 
and the camp of his barbarian favourites at Samara on the Tigris, about 
twelve leagues above the city of Peace, 105 His son Motawakkel was a 
jealous and cruel tyrant: odious to his subjects, he cast himself on the 
fidelity of the strangers, and these strangers, ambitious and apprehen- 
sive, were tempted by the rich promise of a revolution. At the instiga- 
tion, or at least in the cause of his son, they burst into his apartment 
at the hour of supper, and the caliph was cut into seven pieces by the 
same swords which he had recently distributed among the guards of 
his life and throne. To this throne, yet streaming with a father's blood, 
Montasser was triumphantly led; but in a reign of six months he found 
only the pangs of a guilty conscience. If he wept at the sight of an old 
tapestry which represented the crime and punishment of the son of 
Chosroes; if his days were abridged by grief and remorse, we may allow 
some pity to a parricide, -who exclaimed, in the bitterness of death, that 
he had lost both this world and the world to come. After this act of 
treason, the ensigns of royalty, the garment and walking staff of 
Mohammed, were given and torn away by the foreign mercenaries, who 
in four years created, deposed, and murdered three commanders of the 
faithful. As often as the Turks were inflamed by fear, or rage, or 
avarice, these caliphs were dragged by the feet, exposed naked to the 
scorching sun, beaten with iron clubs, and compelled to purchase, by 
the abdication of their dignity, a short reprieve of inevitable fate. loe 
At length, however, the fury of the tempest was spent or diverted: the 
Abbassides returned to the less turbulent residence of Bagdad; the 
insolence of the Turks was curbed with a firmer and more skilful hand, 
and their numbers were divided and destroyed in foreign warfare. But 
the nations of the East had been taught to trample on the successors 
of the prophet; and the blessings of domestic peace were obtained by 
the relaxation of strength and discipline. So uniform are the mischiefs

of military despotism, that I seem to repeat the story of the Praetorians 
of Rome. 107 

While the flame of enthusiasm was damped by the business, the 
pleasure, and the knowledge of the age, it burnt with concentrated heat 
in the breasts of the chosen few, the congenial spirits, who were ambi- 
tious of reigning either in this world or in the next. How carefully 
soever the book of prophecy had been sealed by the apostle of Mecca, 
the wishes, and (if we may profane the word) even the reason of fanat- 
icism, might believe that, after the successive missions of Adam, Noah, 
Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed, the same God, in the fulness 
of time, would reveal a still more perfect and permanent law. In the 
two hundred and seventy-seventh year of the Hegira, and in the 
neighbourhood of Cufa, an Arabian preacher of the name of Carmath 
assumed the lofty and incomprehensible style of the Guide, the Director, 
the Demonstration, the Word, the Holy Ghost, the Camel, the Herald 
of the Messiah, who had conversed with him in a human shape, and the 
representative of Mohammed the son of AM, of St. John the Baptist, 
and of the angel Gabriel. In his mystic volume the precepts of the 
Koran were refined to a more spiritual sense; he relaxed the duties 
of ablution, fasting, end pilgrimage; allowed the indiscriminate use of 
wine and forbidden food; and nourished the fervour of his disciples by 
the daily repetition of fifty prayers. The idleness and ferment of the 
rustic crowd awakened the attention of the magistrates of Cufa; a 
timid persecution assisted the progress of the new sect; and the name 
of the prophet became more revered after his person had been with* 
drawn from the world; His twelve apostles dispersed themselves among 
the Bedoweens, " a race of men," says Abulfeda, " equally devoid oi 
reason and of religion;" and the success of their preaching seemed to 
threaten Arabia with a new revolution. The Cannathians were ripe for 
rebellion, since they disclaimed the tide of the house of Abbas, and 
abhorred the worldly pomp &lt;)f the caliphs of Bagdad. Tfey were 
susceptible of discipline, since they vowed a blind and absolute sob- 
mission to their Imam, who was called to the prophetic office by the 
voice of God and the people. Instead of the legal tithes he darned 
the fifth of their substance and spoil; the most flagitious sins were no 
more than the type of disobedience; and the brethren were, united and 
concealed by an oath of secrecy. 

After a bloody conflict they prevailed in the province of Bahrein, 
along the Persian Gulf: far -and wide the tribes of the desert were 
subject to the sceptre, or rather to the sword, of Abu Said and his son 
Abu. Taher; and these rebellious .imams could muster in the field a 
hundred and seven thousand fanatics. The mercenaries of the caliph 
were dismayed at the approach of an enemy who neither asked nor

accepted quarter; and the difference between them in fortitude and 
patience is expressive of the change which three centuries of prosperity 
had effected in the character of the Arabians. Such troops were dis- 
comfited in every action; the cities of Racca and Baalbec, of Cufa and 
Bassora, were taken and pillaged; Bagdad was filled with consternation; 
and the caliph trembled behind the veils of his palace. In a daring 
inroad beyond the Tigris, Abu Taher advanced to the gates of the 
capital with no more than five hundred horse. By the special order of 
Moctader the bridges had been broken down, and the person or head of 
the rebel was expected every hour by the commander of the faithful. 
His lieutenant, from a motive of fear or pity, apprised Abu Taher of 
his danger, and recommended a speedy escape. " Your master," said 
the intrepid Carmathian to the messenger, " is at the head of thirty 
thousand soldiers: three such men as these are wanting in his host:" at 
the same instant, turning to three of his companions, he commanded 
the first to plunge a dagger into his breast, the second to leap into the 
Tigris, and the third to cast himself headlong down a precipice. They 
obeyed without a murmur. " Relate," continued the imam, " what you 
have seen: before the evening your general shall be chained among 
my dogs." Before the evening the camp was surprised, and the menace 
was executed. The rapine of the Carmathians was sanctified by their 
aversion to the worship of Mecca: they robbed a caravan of pilgrims, 
and twenty thousand devout Moslems were abandoned on the burning 
sands to a death of hunger and thirst. Another year they suffered the 
pilgrims to proceed without interruption; but, in the festival of devotion, 
Abu Taher stormed the holy city, and trampled on the most venerable 
relics of the Mohammedan faith. Thirty thousand citizens and strangers 
were put to the sword; the sacred precincts were polluted by the burial 
of three thousand dead bodies; the well of Zemzem overflowed with 
blood; the golden spout was forced from its place; the veil of the Caaba 
was divided among these impious sectaries; and the black stone, the 
first monument of the nation, was borne away in triumph to their 
capital. After this deed of sacrilege and cruelty they continued to 
infest the confines of Irak, Syria, and Egypt: but the vital principle 
of enthusiasm had withered at the root. Their scruples or their avarice 
again opened the pilgrimage of Mecca, and restored the black stone of 
the Caaba; and it is needless to inquire into what factions they were 
broken, or by whose swords they were finally extirpated. The sect of 
the Carmathians may be considered as the second visible cause of the 
decline and fall of the empire of the caliphs. 108 
The third and most obvious cause was the weight and magnitude of

Orientate, p. 256-258, 635). I find some inconsistencies of theology and 
chronology, which it would not be easy nor of much importance to reconcile.

the empire itself. The caliph Almamon might proudly assert that it 
was easier for him to rule the East and the West than to manage a 
chess-board of two feet square: 109 yet I suspect that in both those games 
he was guilty of many fatal mistakes; and I perceive that in the 
distant provinces the authority of the first and most powerful of the 
Abbassides was already impaired. The analogy of despotism invests 
the representative with the full majesty of the prince; the division and 
balance of powers might relax the habits of obedience, might encourage 
the passive subject to inquire into the origin and administration of 
civil government. He who is born in the purple is seldom worthy to 
reign; but the elevation of a private man, of a peasant perhaps, or a 
slave, affords a strong presumption of his courage and capacity. The 
viceroy of a remote kingdom aspires to secure the property and inheri- 
tance of his precarious trust; the nations must rejoice in the presence 
of their sovereign; and the command of armies and treasures are at 
once the object and the instrument of his ambition. A change was 
scarcely visible as long as the lieutenants of the caliph were content 
with their vicarious title; while they solicited for themselves or their 
sons a renewal of the Imperial grant, and still maintained on the coin 
and in the public prayers the name and prerogative of the commander 
of the faithful. But in the long and hereditary exercise of power they 
assumed the pride and attributes of royalty; the alternative of peace 
or war, of reward or punishment, depended solely on their will; and the 
revenues of their government were reserved for local services or private 
magnificence. Instead of a regular supply of men and money, the 
successors of the prophet were flattered with the ostentatious gift of an 
elephant, or a cast of hawks, a suit of silk hangings, or some pounds of 
musk and amber. 110 

After the revolt of Spain from the temporal and spiritual supremacy 
of the Abbassides, the first symptoms of disobedience broke forth in 
the province of Africa. Ibrahim, the son of Aglab, the lieutenant of 
the vigilant and rigid Harun, bequeathed to the dynasty of the Aglabites 
the inheritance of his name and power. The indolence or policy of the 
caliphs dissembled the injury and loss, and pursued only with poison the 
founder of the Edrisites, 11 ' 1 who erected the kingdom and city of Fee 
on the shores of the Western ocean. 112 In the East the first dynasty

was that of the Taherites 113 the posterity of the valiant Taher, who, 
in the civil wars of the sons of Harun, had served with too much zeal 
and success the cause of Almamon, the younger brother. He was sent 
into honourable exile, to command on the banks of the Oxus; and the 
independence of his successors, who reigned in Chorasan till lie fourth 
generation, was palliated by their modest and respectful demeanour, 
the happiness of their subjects, and the security of their frontier. They 
were supplanted by one of those adventurers so frequent in the annals 
of the East, who left his trade of a brazier (from whence the name 
of Soffarides) for the profession of a robber. In a nocturnal visit to 
'the treasure of the prince of Sistan, Jacob, the son of Leith, stumbled 
over a lump of salt, which he unwarily tasted with his tongue. Salt, 
;imong the Orientals, is the symbol of hospitality, and the pious robber 
immediately retired without spoil or damage. The discovery of this 
honourable behaviour recommended Jacob to pardon and trust; he led 
an army at first for his benefactor, at last for himself, subdued Persia, 
and threatened the residence of the Abbassides. On his inarch towards 
Bagdad the conqueror was arrested by a fever. He gave audience in 
bed to the ambassador of the caliph; and beside him on a table were 
exposed a naked scimitar, a crust of brown bread, and a bunch of onions. 
" If I die," said he, " your master is delivered from his fears. If I live, 
this must determine between us. If I am vanquished, I can return with- 
out reluctance to the homely fare of my youth." From the height where 
he stood, the descent would not have been so soft or harmless: a timely 
death secured his own repose and that of the caliph, who paid with the 
most lavish concessions the retreat of his brother Amrou to the palaces 
of Shiraz and Ispahan. The Abbassides were too feeble to contend, 
too proud to forgive: they invited the powerful dynasty of the Samanides, 
who passed the Oxus with ten thousand horse, so poor that their stirrups 
were of wood; so brave, that they vanquished the Sofifarian army, eight 
times more numerous than their own. The captive Amrou was sent 
in chains, a grateful offering, to the court of Bagdad; and as the victor 
was content with the inheritance of Transoxiana and Chorasan, the 
realms of Persia returned for a while to the allegiance of the caliphs. 
The provinces of Syria and Egypt were twice dismembered by their 
Turkish slaves of the race of Toulun and Ikshid^ These barbarians, 

of Fez could not be founded in the year of the Hegira 173, since the founder 
was a posthumous child of a descendant of AH, who fled from Mecca in 
the year 168. 2. This founder, Edris, the son of Edris, instead of living to 
the improbable age of 120 years, A.H. 313, died A.H. 214, in the prime of man- 
hood. 3. The dynasty ended A.H. 307, twenty-three years sooner than it, is 
fixed by the historian of the Huns. See the accurate Annals of Abulfeda, 
p. 158, 159, 185, 238. 

118 The dynasties of the Taherites and Soffarides, with the rise of that of 
the Samanides, are described in the original history and Latin version of 
Mirchond: yet the most interesting facts had already been drained by the 
diligence of M. D'Herbelot

in religion and manners the countrymen of Mohammed, emerged from 
the bloody factions of the palace to a provincial command and an inde- 
pendent throne: their names became famous and formidable in their 
time; but the founders of these two potent dynasties confessed, either 
in words or actions, the vanity of ambition. The first on his deathbed 
implored the mercy of God to a sinner, ignorant of the limits of his own 
power: the second, in the midst of four hundred thousand soldiers and 
eight thousand slaves, concealed from every human eye the chamber 
where he attempted to sleep. Their sons were educated in the vices 
of kings; and both Egypt and Syria were recovered and possessed by the 
Abbassides during an interval of thirty years. In the decline of their 
empire, Mesopotamia, with the important cities of Mosul and Aleppo, 
was occupied by the Arabian princes of the tribe of Eamadan. The 
poets of their court could repeat, without a blush, that nature had formed 
their countenances for beauty, their tongues for eloquence, and their 
hands for liberality and valour: but the genuine tale of the elevation 
and reign of the Hamadanites exhibits a scene of treachery, murder, and 
parricide. At the same fatal period the Persian kingdom was again 
usurped by the dynasty of the Bowides, by the sword of three brothers, 
who, under various names, were styled the support and columns of the 
state, and who, from the Caspian sea to the ocean, would suffer no tyrants 
but themselves. Under their reign the language and genius of Persia 
revived, and the Arabs, three hundred and four years after the death 
of Mohammed, were deprived of the sceptre of the East. 

Rahdi, the twentieth of the Abfaassides, and the thirty-ninth of the 
successors of Mohammed, was the last who deserved the title of com- 
mander of the faithful; 115 the last (says Abulfeda) who spoke to the 
people or conversed with the learned; the last who, in the expense of 
his household, represented the wealth and magnificence of the ancient 
caliphs. After him, the lords of the Eastern world were reduced to the 
most abject misery, and exposed to the blows and insults of a servile 
condition. The revolt of the provinces circumscribed their dominions 
within the walls of Bagdad: but that capital still contained an Innumer- 
able multitude, vain of their past fortune, discontented with their present 

Toulunides and Ikshidites of Egypt, and thrown some light on the Car- 
mathians and Hamadanites.

state, and oppressed by the demands of a treasury which had formerly 
been replenished by the spoil and tribute of nations. Their idleness 
was exercised by faction and controversy. Under the mask of piety, 
the rigid followers of Hanbal 116 invaded the pleasures of domestic life, 
burst into the houses of plebeians and princes, spilt the wine, broke the 
instruments, beat the musicians, and dishonoured, with infamous sus- 
picions, the associates of every handsome youth. In each profession 
which allowed room for two persons, the one was a votary, the other an 
antagonist, of Ali; and the Abbassides were awakened by the clamorous 
grief of the sectaries, who denied their title, and cursed their progenitors. 
A turbulent people could only be repressed by a military force; but who 
could satisfy the avarice or assert the discipline of the mercenaries 
themselves? Ihe African and Turkish guards drew their swords 
against each other, and the chief commanders, the emirs al Ornra, 117 
imprisoned or desposed their sovereigns, and violated the sanctuary of 
the mosch and haram. If the caliphs escaped to the camp or court 
of any neighbouring prince, their deliverance was a change of servitude, 
till they were prompted by despair to invite the Bowides, the sultans of 
Persia, who silenced the factions of Bagdad by their irresistible arms. 
The civil and military powers were assumed by Moezaldowlat, the 
second of the three brothers, and a stipend of sixty thousand pounds 
sterling was assigned by his generosity for the private expense of the 
commander of the faithful. But on the fortieth day, at the audience 
of the ambassadors of Chorasan, and in the presence of a trembling 
multitude, the caliph was dragged from his throne to a dungeon, by the 
command of the stranger, and the rude hands of his Dilemites. His 
palace was pillaged, his eyes were put out, and the mean ambition of 
the Abbassides aspired to the vacant station of danger and disgrace. 
In the school of adversity the luxurious caliphs resumed the grave and 
abstemious virtues of the primitive times. Despoiled of their armour 
and silken robes, they fasted, they prayed, they studied the Koran and 
the tradition of the Sonnites: they performed, with zeal and knowledge, 
the functions of their ecclesiastical character. The respect of nations 
still waited on the successors of the apostle, the oracles of the law and 
conscience of the faithful; and the weakness or division of their tyrants 
sometimes restored the Abbassides to the sovereignty of Bagdad. But 
their misfortunes had been embittered by the triumph of the Fatimites, 
the real or spurious progeny of Ali. Arising from the extremity of 

116 Their master, on a similar occasion, showed himself of a more indulgent 
and tolerating spirit Ahmed Ebn Hanbal, the head of one of the four 
orthodox sects, was born at Bagdad A.H. 164, and died there A.H. 241. He 
fought and suffered in the dispute concerning the creation of the Koran. 

The office of vizir was superseded by the emir al Omra, Imperator Im- 
peratorum, a title first instituted by Rahdi, and which merged at length in 
the Bowides and Seljukides: vectigalibus, et tributis, et curiis per omnes 
regiones praefecit, jussitque in omnibus suggestis nominis ejus in concionibus

.Africa, these successful rivals extinguished, in Egypt and Syria, both 
the spiritual and temporal authority of the Abbassides; and the monarch 
of the Nile insulted the humble pontiff on the banks of the Tigris. 

In the declining age of the caliphs, in the century which elapsed after 
the war of Theophilus and Motassem, the hostile transactions of the 
two nations were confined to some inroads by sea and land, the fruits 
of their close vicinity and indelible hatred. But when the Eastern world 
was convulsed and broken, the Greeks were roused from their lethargy 
by the hopes of conquest and revenge. The Byzantine empire, since 
the accession of the Basilian race, had reposed in peace and dignity; 
and they might encounter with their entire strength the front of some 
petty emir, whose rear was assaulted and threatened by his national 
foes of the Mohammedan faith. The lofty titles of the morning-star, 
and the death of the Saracens, 118 were applied in the public acclama- 
tions to Nicephorus Phocas, a prince as renowned in the camp as he 
was unpopular in the city. In the subordinate station of great domestic 2 
or general of the East, he reduced the island of Crete, and extirpated 
the nest of pirates who had so long defied, with impunity, the majesty of 
the empire. 119 His military genius was displayed in the conduct and 
success of the enterprise, which had so often failed with loss and dis- 
honour. The Saracens were confounded by the landing of his troops on 
safe and level bridges, which he cast from the vessels to the shore. 
Seven months were consumed in the siege of Candia; the despair of the 
native Cretans was stimulated by the frequent aid of their brethren of 
Africa and Spain; and, after the massy wall and double ditch had been 
stormed by the Greeks, a hopeless conflict was still maintained in the 
streets and houses of the city. The whole island was subdued in the 
capital, and a submissive people accepted, without resistance, the bap* 
tism of the conqueror. 120 Constantinople applauded the long-forgotten 
pomp of a triumph; but the Imperial diadem was the sole reward that 
could repay the service, or satisfy the ambition, of Nicephorus,

of the Basilian race, his widow Theophania successively married Ni

suggests the names of reproach and contempt more applicable to Nicephorus 
than the vain titles of the Greeks, Ecce venit Stella matutina, surgit Ecus, 
reverberat obtutu solis radios, pallida Saracenorum mors, Nicephorus tufa*. 

330 Notwithstanding the insinuation of Zonaras, Kid el jrij, etc. (torn. ii. 
L xvi. [c. 23] p. 197), it is an undoubted fact that Crete was completely and 
finally subdued by Nicephorus Phocas (Pagi, Critica, torn, iii. p. 873-875; 
Meursius, Greta, 1. iii. c. 7, torn. iii. p. 464, 465). 

390 A Greek Life of St Nicon the Armenian was found in the Sforza library, 
and translated into Latin by the Jesuit Sinnond, for the use of Cardinal

cephorus Phocas and his assassin John Zimisces, the two heroes of the 
age. They reigned as the guardians and colleagues of her infant sons; 
and the twelve years of their military command form the most splendid 
period of the Byzantine annals. The subjects and confederates whom 
they led to war appeared, at least in the eyes of an enemy, two hundred 
thousand strong; and of these about thirty thousand were armed with 
cuirasses: 121 a train of four thousand mules attended their inarch; and 
their evening camp was regularly fortified with an enclosure of iron 
spikes. A series of bloody and undecisive combats is nothing more than 
an anticipation of what would have been effected in a few years by the 
course of nature: but I shall briefly prosecute the conquests of the two 
emperors from the hills of Cappadocia to the desert of Bagdad. The 
sieges of Mopsuestia and Tarsus, in Cilicia, first exercised the skill and 
perseverance of their troops, on whom, at this moment, I shall not hesi- 
tate to bestow the name of Romans. In the double city of Mopsuestia, 
which is divided by the river Sarus, two hundred thousand Moslems 
were predestined to death or slavery, 122 a surprising degree of popula- 
tion, which must at least include the inhabitants of the dependent dis- 
tricts. They were surrounded and taken by assault; but Tarsus was 
reduced by the slow progress of famine; and no sooner had the Saracens 
yielded on honourable terms than they were mortified by the distant 
and unprofitable view of the naval succours of Egypt. They were dis- 
missed with a safe-conduct to the confines of Syria: a part of the old 
Christians had quietly lived under their dominion; and the vacant 
habitations were replenished by a new colony. But the mosch was con- 
verted into a stable; the pulpit was delivered to the flames; many rich 
crosses of gold and gems, the spoil of Asiatic churches, were made a 
grateful offering to the piety or avarice of the emperor; and he trans- 
ported the gates of Mopsuestia and Tarsus, which were fixed in the 
wall of Constantinople, an eternal monument of his victory. After they 
had forced and secured the narrow passes of Mount Amanus, the two 
Roman princes repeatedly carried their arms into the heart of Syria. 
Yet, instead of assaulting the walls of Antioch, the humanity or super- 
stition of Nicephorus appeared to respect the ancient metropolis of the 
East: he contented himself with drawing round the city a line of circum- 
vallation; left a stationary army; and instructed his lieutenant to expect, 
without impatience, the return of spring. But in the depth of winter, 
in a dark and rainy night, an adventurous subaltern, with three hundred

soldiers, approached the rampart, applied his scaling-ladders, occupied 
two adjacent towers, stood firm against the pressure of multitudes, and 
bravely maintained his post till he was relieved by the tardy, though 
effectual, support of his reluctant chief. The first tumult of slaughter 
and rapine subsided; the reign of Caesar and of Christ was restored; and 
the efforts of a. hundred thousand Saracens, of the armies of Syria and 
the fleets of Afric, were consumed without effect before the walls of 
Antioch. The royal city of Aleppo was subject to Seifeddowlat, of the 
dynasty of Hamadan, who clouded his past glory by the precipitate 
retreat which abandoned his kingdom and capital to the Roman invaders. 
In his stately palace, .that stood without the walls of Aleppo, they 
joyfully seized a well-furnished magazine of arms, a stable of fourteen 
hundred mules, and three hundred bags of silver and gold. But the 
walls of the city withstood the strokes of their battering-rams; and the 
besiegers pitched their tents on the neighbouring mountain of Jaushan, 
Their retreat exasperated the quarrel of the townsmen and mercenaries; 
the guard of the gates and ramparts was deserted; and, while they 
furiously charged each other in the market-place, they were surprised and 
destroyed by the sword of a common enemy. The male sex was ex- 
terminated by the sword; ten, thousand youths were led into captivity; 
the weight of the precious spoil exceeded the strength and number of the 
beasts of burthen; the superfluous remainder was burnt; and, after a 
licentious possession of ten days, the Romans marched away from the 
naked and bleeding city. In their Syrian inroads they commanded the 
husbandmen to cultivate their lands, that they themselves, in the eiso- 
ing season, might reap the benefit: more than a hundred cities were 
reduced to obedience; and eighteen pulpits of the principal moschs were 
committed to the flames to expiate the sacrilege of the disciples of 
Mohammed. The classic names of Hierapolis, Apamea, and Emesa 
revive for a moment in the list of conquest: the emperor Zinrisces en- 
camped in the paradise of Damascus, and accepted the ransom of a 
submissive people; and the torrent was only stopped by the impregnabte 
fortress of Tripoli, on the sea-coast of Phoenicia. Since the days of 
Heradius, the Euphrates, below the passage of Mount Taurus,, had 
been impervious, and almost invisible, to the Greeks. The river yielded 
a free passage to the victorious Zimisces: and the historian may imitate 
the speed with which he overran the once famous cities of Samosata, 
Edessa, Martyropolis^ Anrida, 123 and Nisibis, the ancient limit of the 
-empire in the neighbourhood of the Tigris. His ardour was quickened 
by the desire of grasping the virgin treasures of Ecbatana, 12 * a well-

known name, under which the Byzantine writer has concealed the 
capital of the Abbassides. The consternation of the fugitives had already 
diffused the terror of his name; but the fancied riches of Bagdad had 
already been dissipated by the avarice and prodigality of domestic 
tyrants. The prayers of the people, aqd the stern demands of the lieu- 
tenant of the Bowides, required the caliph to provide for the defence 
of the city. The helpless Mothi replied, that his arms, his revenues, 
and his provinces had been torn from his hands, and that he was ready 
to abdicate a dignity which he was unable to support. The emir was 
inexorable; the furniture of the palace was sold; and the paltry price 
of forty thousand pieces of gold was instantly consumed in private 
luxury. But the apprehensions of Bagdad were relieved by the retreat 
of the Greeks: thirst and hunger guarded the desert of Mesopotamia; 
and the emperor, satiated with glory, and laden with Oriental spoils, 
returned to Constantinople, and displayed, in his triumph, the silk, the 
aromatics, and three hundred myriads of gold and silver. Yet the powers 
of the East had been bent, not broken, by this transient hurricane. After 
the departure of the Greeks, the fugitive princes returned to their 
capitals; the subjects disclaimed their involuntary oaths of allegiance; 
the Moslems again purified their temples, and overturned the idols of 
the saints and martyrs; the Nestorians and Jacobites preferred a Saracen 
to an orthodox master; and the numbers and spirit of the Melchites 
were inadequate to the support of the church and state. Of these exten- 
sive conquests, Antioch, with the cities of Cilicia and the isle of Cyprus, 
was alone restored, a permanent and useful accession to the Roman 
empire. 125

and Power of the Emperors Tactics of the Greeks, Arabs, and Franks-

A RAY of historic light seems to beam from the darkness of the tenth 
century. We open with curiosity and respect the royal volumes of 
Constantine Porphyrogenitus, 1 which he composed at a mature age 
for the instruction of his son, and which promise to unfold the state 
of the Eastern empire, both in peace and war, both at home and abroad. 
In the first of these works he minutely describes the pompous cere- 
monies of the church and palace of Constantinople, according to his 
own practice and that of his predecessors. 2 In the second he attempts 
an accurate survey of the provinces, the themes, as they were then de- 
nominated, both of Europe and Asia. 8 The system of Roman ^tactics, 
the discipline and order of the troops, and the military operations by 
land and sea, are explained in the third of these didactic collections, 
which may be ascribed to Constantine or his father Leo.* In the fourth, 

1 The epithet of ttopfvpoybijTos, Porphyrogenitus, born in the purple, is 
elegantly defined by Qaudjan: 

Ardua privates nescxt fortuna Penates j 
Et regnum cum luce dedit Cognata potestas 
Excepit Tyrio venerabile pignus in ostro. 

And Ducange, in his Greek and Latin Glossaries, produces many passages 
expressive of the same idea. 

* A splendid MS. of Constantine, de Caeremoniis Aula et Ecclesia Byzan- 
tinae, wandered from Constantinople to Buda, Frankfort, and Leipsic, where 
it was published in a splendid edition by Leich and Reiske (AJ&gt;. 175*1 &amp; 
folio), with such lavish praise as editors never fail to bestow on the worthy 
or worthless object of their toil. 

See, in the first volume of Banduri's Imperium Orientate, Constantmua 
de Thematibus, p. 1-24 [torn. iii. p. 11-64, ed. Bonn] ; de Administrando Im- 
perio, p. 45-127, edit Venet [t iii. p. 65-270, ed. Bonn], The text of the old 
edition of Meursius is corrected from a MS. of the royal library of Pans, 
which Isaac Casaubon had formerly seen (Epist ad Polybium, p. 10), and 
the sense is illustrated by two maps of William Deslisle, the prince of geog- 
raphers till the appearance of the greater D'Anville.

of the administration of the empire, he reveals the secrets of the Byzan- 
tine policy, in friendly or hostile intercourse with the nations of the 
earth. The literary labours of the age, the practical systems of law, 
agriculture, and history, might redound to the benefit of the subject, 
and the honour of the Macedonian princes. The sixty books of the 
Basitics* the code and pandects of civil jurisprudence, were gradually 

still corrupt and mutilated, the version is still obscure and faulty. The 
Imperial library of Vienna would afford some valuable materials to a new 
editor (Fabric. Biblioth. Graec. torn. vi. p. 36pj 370). 

a On the subject of the Basilics, Fabricius (Biblioth. Graec, torn. xii. p. 425- 
514), and Heineccius (Hist. Juris Romani, p. 396-399), and Giannone (Istoria 
Civile di Napoli, torn. i. p. 450-458), as historical civilians, may be usefully 
consulted. Forty-one books of this Greek code have been published, with 
a Latin version, by Charles Annibal Fabrottus (Paris, 1647), in seven tomes 
in folio; four other books have been since discovered, and are inserted in 
Gerard Meerman's Novus Thesaurus Juris Civ. et Canon, torn. v. Of the 
whole work, the sixty books, John Leunclavius has printed (Basil, 1575) 
an eclogue or synopsis. The 113 novels, or new laws, of Leo, may be found 
in the Corpus Juris Civilis. 

[The question of Byzantine law may be fittingly discussed now, inasmuch 
as the recent labours of well-known scholars have thrown new light on 
the subject Although the .compilation of Justinian was mainly intended for 
people who spoke Greek, the emperor restricted its use by promulgating it 
in the Latin language, which was unintelligible to the greater part of his 
subjects. This defect was remedied to a great extent by a Greek school 
of jurists, which had flourished even before his reign, and who translated 
the Corpus Juris into the Greek language. The consequence was that the 
original was soon disused throughout the Eastern empire, and that Greek 
translations of the Institutions, the Pandects, and the Code usurped their 
place. These translations, however, were not stamped by any official au- 
thority; and in the times of confusion which followed the reign of Heradius 
even the translations were neglected, and their place was supplied by the 
writings of commentators who had published abridgments of the laws. Leo 
III., the Isaurian, attempted to remedy this evil by publishing a Greek 
Manual of Law, which became the primary authority in all the courts in 
the empire. This Manual, which was revised by Constantine Copronymus, 
the son of Leo, bore the title of Ecloga ('EjcXo7^ rQv v6iu*v) t and is still 
extant in many MSS. which, until a recent time, were erroneously supposed 
to be Prochiron, or Manual of Basil, Constantine, and Leo, of which we 
shall speak presently. The Ecloga of Leo and Constantine Copronymus con- 
tains eighteen titles, and adopts an order entirely different from that of the 
Institutes &lt;of Justinian. It omits entirely some very important matters, such 
as servitudes and the different modes of acquiring property. Its authority 
was abrogated by Basil I., who severely censured it on account of its im- 
perfections, and declares it to be an insult to the earlier legislators. 

A more complete reform in the Byzantine law was effected by Basil I. 
His legislation was comprised in three works: i. Prochiron (irp6x*F&gt;* y^/wj), 
a manual intended to serve as an introduction to the science. 2. Bt*siUca (ri 
j8curt\tjc&lt;), a revision of the ancient laws. 3, Epanpgog ^Evavayoy^ TW 
v6fjA&gt;v), a second edition of the Prochiron Manual published after the Basilica. 

The Prochiron is issued in the names of Basil and of his two sons, Con- 
stantine and Leo, and was probably issued about A.D. 870. It contains forty 
titles. The former half of the work is executed in an entirely different 
manner from the latter. In the first twenty titles the same plan has been 
followed as in the Basilica; the extracts from the Institutions are first given, 
and these are followed successively by extracts from the Pandects, Code&gt; 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 263 

framed in the three first reigns of that prosperous dynasty. The art of 
agriculture had amused the leisure, and exercised the pens, of the best 
and wisest of the ancients; and their chosen precepts are comprised in 
the twenty books of the Geoponics 6 of Constantine. At his command 
the historical examples of vice and virtue were methodised in fifty- 
three books, 7 and every citizen might apply to his contemporaries or 
himself the lesson or the warning of past times. From the august char- 
acter of a legislator, the sovereign of the East descends to the more 
humble office of a teacher and a scribe; and if his successors and sub- 
jects were regardless of his paternal cares, we may inherit and enjoy 
the everlasting legacy. 

Novelise of Justinian, and then from the Novellae of succeeding emperors, 
but in the last twenty titles this well-arranged plan is abandoned, from a 
determination to hurry the work to a conclusion. The Ecloga of Leo, which 
Basil so strongly condemns, now becomes the basis of his work; the extracts 
from the Institutions and the Novelise are very numerous, while the Pandects 
and the Code are almost entirely neglected. 

The Basilica contains a complete code of Byzantine law. It was originally 
published by Basil about 884, under the title " The Revision of the Old Laws'" 
('Avaxdeapffis rwv iraX&lt;uv yojttwv). It was divided into forty books, though 
Basil in the Prochiron had announced that the new Code would consist of 
sixty books. This Code, however, was again revised and enlarged by Leo 
the Philosopher, and was published in his own name and that of his son. 
Constantine Porphyrogenitus, between 905 and 911. It is this new and revised 
Code which we now possess under the title of Basilica or Imperial laws. 
The earlier Code of Basil has entirely disappeared. The Basilica, like the 
Pandects of Justinian, is a collection of all the authorities of Byzantine law. 
It is compiled from the Greek translations of Justinian's laws, and from the 
Greek commentaries on them which had received the sanction of the Byzan- 
tine legal schools. It was not a new translation of the Latin text of Jus- 
tinian, but it embodied the Greek texts which had been In existence more 
than three centuries. Each of the sixty books is distributed into titles, 
which are again subdivided into chapters and paragraphs. Each title contains, 
with more or less accuracy, all the laws relating to this subject in the Institu- 
tions, Pandects, Code, and Novelise, and thus presents in one place the 
enactments upon a subject previously dispersed in four collections. The 
Basilica does not contain everything that is found in the Corpus Juris, but 
it contains numerous t fragments of the opinions of the ancient jurists, and 
of imperial constitutions, which are not contained in the compilation of 
Justinian. The publication of the Basilica led to the gradual disuse of the 
original compilations of Justinian in the East But the Roman law was 
thus more firmly established in Eastern Europe and Western Asia. The 
Basilica continued to be the law of the Byzantine empire until its conquest 
by the Turks, and is the basis of the jurisprudence of Greece to-day. Cf, 
Finlay, Byzantine Empire, also Bury, Later Roman Empire, and Constantine 
Porphyrogenitus on The Administration of the Roman Empire^ Q. S.] 

* I have used the last and best edition of the Geoponics (by Nicolas Niclas, 
Lipsise, 1781, 2 vols. in octavo). I read in the preface that the same emperor 
restored the long-forgotten systems of rhetoric and philosophy; and his two 
books of Hippiatrica, or Horse-physic, were published at Paris, 1530, in folio 
(Fabric. Biblioth. Grsec. torn. vi. p. 493-500). 

T Of these fifty-three books, or titles, only two have been preserved and 
printed de Legationibus (by Fulvius Ursinus, Antwerp, 1582, and Daniel 
Hceschelius, August. Vindel. 1603) and de Virtutibus t Vitiis (by Henry 
Valesius, or de Valois, Paris, 1634) 



264 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

A closer survey will indeed reduce the value of the gift and the grati- 
tude of posterity: in the possession of these Imperial treasures we may 
still deplore. our poverty and ignorance; and the fading glories of their 
authors will be obliterated by indifference or contempt. The Basilics 
will sink to a broken copy, a partial and mutilated version in the Greek 
language, of the laws of Justinian; but the sense of the old civilians is 
often superseded by the influence of bigotry: and the absolute prohibi- 
tion of divorce, concubinage, and interest for money, enslaves the free- 
dom of trade and the happiness of private life. In the historical book 
a subject of Constantine might admire the inimitable virtues of Greece 
and Rome: he might learn to what a pitch of energy and elevation the 
human character had formerly aspired. But a contrary effect must have 
been produced by a new edition of the lives of the saints, which the 
great logothete, or chancellor of the empire, was directed to prepare; 
and the dark fund of superstition was enriched by the fabulous and 
florid legends of Simon the Metapkrast? The merits and miracles of the 
whole calendar are of less account in the eyes of a sage than the toil 
of a single husbandman, who multiplies the gifts of lie Creator and 
supplies the food of his brethren. Yet the royal authors of the Geoponics 
were more seriously employed in expounding the precepts of the destroy- 
ing art, which has been taught since the days of Xenophon 9 as the art 
o'f heroes and kings. But the Tactics of Leo and Constantine are mingled 
with the baser alloy of the age in which they lived. It was destitute 
of original genius; they implicitly transcribe the rules and maxims which 
had been confirmed by victories. It was unskilled in the propriety of 
style and method; they blindly confound the most distant and discordant 
institutions, the phalanx of Sparta and that of Macedon, the legions of 
Cato and Trajan, of Augustus and Theodosius. Even the use, or at 
least the importance, of these military rudiments may be fairly ques- 
tioned: their general theory is dictated by reason; but the merit, as 
well as difficulty, consists in the application. The discipline of a soldier 
is formed by exercise rather than by study: the talents of a commander 
are appropriated to those calm, though rapid, minds, which nature 
produces to decide the fate of armies and nations: the former is the habit 
.of a life, the latter the glance of a moment; and the battles won by 
lessons of tactics may be numbered with the epic poems created from 

8 The life and writings of Simeon Metaphrastes are described by Hankius 
(de Scriptoribus Byzant. p. 418-460). This biographer of the saints indulged 
himself in a loose paraphrase of the sense or nonsense of more ancient acts. 
His Greek rhetoric is again paraphrased in the Latin version of Surius, and 
scarcely a thread can be now visible of the original texture. 

'According to the first book of the Cyropaedia, professors of tactics, a 
small part of the science of war, were already instituted in Persia, by which 
Greece must be understood. A good edition of all the Scriptores Tactic* 
would be a task not unworthy of a scholar. His industry might discovei 
some new MSS., and his learning might illustrate the military history of the 
ancients. But this scholar should be likewise a. soldier; and, alasl Quintus 
Itilius is no more.

the rules of criticism. The book of ceremonies is a recital, tedious yet 
imperfect, of the despicable pageantry which had infected the church 
and state since the gradual decay of the purity of the one and the power 
of the other. A review of the themes or provinces might promise such 
authentic and useful information as the curiosity of government only 
can obtain, instead of traditionary fables on the origin of the cities, 
and malicious epigrams on the vices of their inhabitants, 10 Such in- 
formation the historian would have been pleased to record; nor should 
his silence be condemned if the most interesting objects, the population 
of the capital and provinces, the amount of the taxes and revenues, the 
numbers of subjects and strangers who served under the Imperial 
standard, have been unnoticed by Leo the Philosopher and his son Con- 
stantine. His treatise of the public administration is stained with the 
same blemishes; yet it is discriminated by peculiar merit: the antiquities 
of the nations may be doubtful or fabulous; but the geography and man- 
ners of the barbaric world are delineated with curious accuracy. Of 
these nations the Franks alone were qualified to observe in their turn, 
and to describe, the metropolis of the East. The ambassador of the 
great Otho, a bishop of Cremona, has painted the state of Constantinople 
about the middle of the tenth century: his style is glowing, his narrative 
lively, his observation keen; and even the prejudices and passions of 
Liutprand are stamped with an original character of freedom and 
genius. 11 From this scanty fund of foreign and domestic materials I 
shall investigate the form and substance of the Byzantine empire; the 
provinces and wealth, the civil government and military force, the char- 
acter and literature, of the Greeks in a period of six hundred years, 
from the reign of Heradius to the successful invasion of the Franks 
or Latins. 

After the final division between the sons of Theodosius, the swarms 
of barbarians from Scythia and Germany overspread the provinces and 
extinguished the empire of ancient Rome. The weakness of Constan- 
tinople was concealed by extent of dominion; her limits were inviolate, 
or at least entire; and the kingdom of Justinian was enlarged by the 
splendid acquisition of Africa and Italy. But the possession of these 
new conquests was transient and precarious, and almost a moiety of

the Eastern empire was torn away by the arms of the Saracens. Syria 
and Egypt were oppressed by the Arabian caliphs, and, after the reduc- 
tion of Africa, their lieutenants invaded and subdued the Roman province 
which had been changed into the Gothic monarchy of Spain. The islands 
of the Mediterranean were not inaccessible to their naval powers; and 
it was from their extreme stations, the harbours of Crete and the 
fortresses of Cilicia, that the faithful or rebel emirs insulted the majesty 
of the throne and capital. The remaining provinces, under the obedience 
of the emperors, were cast into a new mould; and the jurisdiction of the 
presidents, the consulars, and the counts was superseded by the insti- 
tution of the themes?* or military governments, which prevailed under 
the successors of Heraclius, and are described by the pen of the royal 
author. Of the twenty-nine themes, twelve in Europe and seventeen 
in Asia, the origin is obscure, the etymology doubtful or capricious, the 
limits were arbitrary and fluctuating; but some particular names that 
sound the most strangely to our ear were derived from the character 
and attributes of the troops that were maintained at the expense and 
for the guard of the respective divisions. The vanity of the Greek princes 
most eagerly grasped the shadow of conquest and the memory of lost 
dominion. A new Mesopotamia was created on the western side of the 
Euphrates; the appellation and praetor of Sicily were transferred to a 
narrow slip of Calabria; and a fragment of the duchy of Beneventum 
was promoted to the style aitd title of the theme of Lombardy. In the 
decline of the Arabian empire the successors of Constantine might in- 
dulge their pride in more solid advantages. The victories of Nicephorus, 
John Zimisces, and Basil the Second, revived the fame, and enlarged 
the boundaries;, of the Roman name; the province of Cilicia, the 
metropolis of Antioch, the islands of Crete and Cyprus were restored 
to the allegiance of Christ and Caesar; one-third of Italy was annexed 
to the throne of Constantinople, the kingdom of Bulgaria was destroyed, 
and the last sovereigns of the Macedonian dynasty extended their sway 
from the sources of the Tigris to the neighbourhood of Rome. In the 
eleventh century the prospect was again clouded by new enemies and 
new misfortunes; the relics of Italy were swept away by the Norman 
adventurers, and almost all the Asiatic branches were dissevered from 
the Roman trunk by the Turkish conquerors. After these losses the 
emperors of the Comnenian family continued to reign from the Danube 
to Peloponnesus, and from Belgrade to Nice, Trebizond, and the winding 
stream of the Meander. The spacious provinces of Thrace, Macedonia, 
and Greece were obedient to their .sceptre; the possession of Cyprus, 
Rhodes, and Crete was accompanied by the fifty islands of the

or Holy Sea, 13 and the remnant of their empire transcends the measure 
of the largest of the European kingdoms. 

The same princes might assert, with dignity and truth, that of all the 
monarchs of Christendom they possessed the greatest city, 14 the most 
ample revenue, the most flourishing and populous state. With the decline 
and fall of the empire the cities of the West had decayed and fallen; 
nor could the ruins of Rome, or the mud walls, wooden hovels, and 
narrow precincts of Paris and London, prepare the Latin stranger to 
contemplate the situation and extent of Constantinople, her statelj 
palaces and churches, and the arts and luxury of an innumerable people. 
Her treasures might attract, but her virgin strength had repelled, and 
still promised to repel, the audacious invasion of the Persian and Bui 
garian, the Arab and the Russian. The provinces were less fortunate 
and impregnable, and few districts, few cities, could be discovered which 
had not been violated by some fierce barbarian, impatient to despoil, 
because he was hopeless to possess. From the age of Justinian the 
Eastern empire was sinking below its former level; the powers of destruc- 
tion were more active than those of improvement; and the calamities 
of war were embittered by the more permanent evils of civil and eccle- 
siastical tyranny. The captive who had escaped from the barbarians- 
was often stripped and imprisoned by the ministers of his sovereign, 
the Greek superstition relaxed the mind by prayer, and emaciated the 
body by fasting; and the multitude of convents and festivals diverted 
many hands and many days from the temporal service of mankind. 
Yet the subjects of the Byzantine empire were still the most dexterous 
and diligent of nations; their country was" blessed by nature with even- 
advantage of soil, dimate, and situation; and, in the support and restora- 
tion of the arts, their patient and peaceful temper was more useful than 
the warlike spirit and feudal anarchy of Europe. The provinces that 
still adhered to the empire were repeopled and enriched by the mis- 
fortunes of those which were irrecoverably lost. From the yoke of the 
caliphs, the Catholics of Syria, Egypt, and Africa retired to the alle- 
giance of their prince, to the society of their brethren; the movable 
wealth, which eludes the search of oppression, accompanied and alleviated 
their exile, and Constantinople received into her bosom the fugitive 
trade of Alexandria and Tyre. The chiefs of Armenia and Scythia, who

fled from hostile or religious persecution, were hospitably entertained; 
their followers were encouraged to build new cities and to cultivate 
waste lands; and many spots, both in Europe and Asia, preserved the 
name, the manners, or at least the memory, of these national colonies. 
Even the tribes of barbarians who had seated themselves in arms on the 
territory of the empire were gradually reclaimed to the laws of the church 
and state, and, as long as they were separated from the Greeks, their 
posterity supplied a race of faithful and obedient soldiers. Did we 
possess sufficient materials to survey the twenty-nine themes of the 
Byzantine monarchy, our curiosity might be satisfied with a chosen 
example: it is fortunate enough that the clearest light should be thrown 
j&gt;n the most interesting province, and the name of PELOPONNESUS will 
awaken the attention of the classic reader. 

.As early as the eighth century, in the troubled reign of the Iconoclasts, 
Greece, and even Peloponnesus, 15 were overrun by some Sclavonian 



pdppapos, says Constantine (The- 
matibus, 1. ii. c. 6, p. 25 [torn. iii. p. 53, ed. Bonn]), in a style as barbarous 
as the idea, which he confirms, as usual, by a foolish epigram. The epitomiser 
of Strabo likewise observes, Kal PVV 8k ireurav "Hirctpov Kal EXXdSa trxeSfo, Kal

weary dance (Geograph. Minor, torn. ii. dissert, vi. p. 170-191), to enumerate 
the inroads of the Sclavi, and to fix the date (A.D. 980) of this petty geog- 
rapher. 

[The question of the Slavs in Greece is a very obscure one, and has en- 
gaged the attention of many of our best scholars. Prof. Fallmerayer, for 
instance, maintains that the Hellenic race in Europe was exterminated by the 
Slavonians, and that the present inhabitants of Greece are Byzantinised Sla- 
vonians. There can be no doubt that the Slavonians formed the bulk of 
the population of Greece for several centuries. This is expressly stated by 
the Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus, who refers the completion of 
the Slavonic colonisation of Greece to the time of the great pestilence, which 
depopulated the East in AJ&gt;. 746. In the same century the European navi- 
gators spoke of the Peloponnesus as " Slavonian land." But of the history 
of the Slavonian conquests in Greece we have only the scantiest account 
Their invasion of the country in the reign of Justinian has been already 
mentioned, and their permanent settlement in the Peloponnesus appears to 
have been made under the shelter of the Avar power towards the end of 
the sixth century. Under the feeble sway of the successors of Justinian the 
Slavonians in the Peloponnesus became independent of the Byzantine empire, 
and no attempt was made to check their growing power till the reign of 
Leo III., the Isaurian, who breathed new life into the decaying empire. The 
Slavonians in their turn made a vigorous effort to maintain their independ- 
ence, and to become masters of the whole of the Peloponnesus. For this 
purpose, in the year 807, they made the unsuccessful attempt upon Patras 
mentioned by Gibbon. From this time the Greeks gradually regained the 
ascendency; but in the reign of Theophilus, the Slavonians again rose in 
arms and were masters of the open country for several years. They were, 
however, subdued by Theodora, who governed the empire during the minority 
of her son Michael III, A.D. 842, and it was on this occasion that the Ezeritae 
and Milengi, two Slavonian tribes, the former in the neighbourhood of Helos 
and the latter in that of Sparta, became tributary to the Byzantine govern- 
ment They, however, rebelled in the reign of Romanus I., and upon being 
re-conquered, their tribute was fixed at 1200 pieces of gold. When the Franks

bands who outstripped the royal standard of Bulgaria. The strangers 
of old, Cadmus, and Danaus, and Pelops, had planted in that fruitful 
soil the seeds of policy and learning; but the savages of the north 
eradicated what yet remained of their sickly and withered roots. In this 
irruption the country and the inhabitants were transformed; the Grecian 
blood was contaminated; and the proudest nobles of Peloponnesus were 
branded with the names of foreigners and slaves. By the diligence of 
succeeding princes, the land was in some measure purified from flie 
barbarians; and the humble remnant was bound by an oath of obedience, 
tribute, and military service, which they often renewed and often vio- 
lated. The siege of Patras was formed by a singular concurrence of 
the Slavonians of Peloponnesus and the Saracens of Africa. In their 
last distress a pious fiction of the approach of the praetor of Corinth 
revived the courage of the citizens. Their sally was bold and successful; 
the strangers embarked, the rebels submitted, and the glory of the day 
was ascribed to a phantom or a stranger, who fought in the foremost 
ranks under the character of St. Andrew the Apostle. The shrine whicli 
contained his relics was decorated with the trophies of victory, and the 
captive race was for ever devoted to the service and vassalage of th* 
metropolitan church of Patras. By the revolt of two Sclavonian tribes 
in the neighbourhood of Helos- and Lacedaemon, the peace of the penin- 
sula was often disturbed. They sometimes insulted the weakness, and 
sometimes resisted the oppression, of the Byzantine government, till at 
length the approach of their hostile brethren extorted a golden bull to 
define the rights and obligations of the Ezzerites and Milengi, whose 
annual tribute was defined at twelve hundred pieces of gold. From these 
strangers the Imperial geographer has accurately distinguished a domes- 
tic and perhaps original race, who, in some degree, might derive their 
blood from the much-injured Helots. The liberality of the Romans, and 
especially of Augustus, had enfranchised the maritime cities from the 
dominion of Sparta; and the continuance of the same benefit ennobled 
them with the title of Eleuthero, or Free-Laconians. 16 In the time of 
Constantine Porphyrogenitus they had acquired the name of Mainotes, 
under which they dishonour the claim of liberty by the inhuman pillage 
of all that is shipwrecked on their rocky shores. Their territory, barren 

invaded the Peloponnesus at the beginning of the thirteenth century the 
Melingi were masters of Mount Taygetus; and in Elis, Slavonians were in 
possession of a district called Skorta, extending from the ruins of Olympia 
to the sources of the Ladon. The Slav language has long ceased to be 
spoken in Greece, and the only dialectical remains are the names they gave.

of corn but fruitful of olives, extended to the Cape of Malea: they 
accepted a chief or prince from the Byzantine praetor; and a light tribute 
of four hundred pieces of gold was the badge of their immunity rather 
than of their dependence. The freemen of Laconia assumed the char- 
acter of Romans, and long adhered to the religion of the Greeks. By 
the zeal of the emperor Basil, they were baptised in the faith of Christ: 
but the altars of Venus and Neptune had been crowned by these rustic 
votaries five hundred years after they were proscribed in the Roman 
world. In the theme of Peloponnesus 1T forty cities were still numbered, 
and the declining state of Sparta, Argos, and Corinth may be suspended 
in the tenth century, at an equal distance, perhaps, between their antique 
splendour and their present desolation. The duty of military service, 
either in person or by substitute, was imposed on the lands or benefices 
of the province; a sum of five pieces of gold was assessed on each of 
the substantial tenants; and the same capitation was shared among 
several heads of inferior value. On the proclamation of an Italian war, 
the Peloponnesians excused themselves by a voluntary oblation of one 
hundred pounds of gold (four thousand pounds sterling), and a thou- 
sand horses with their arms and trappings. The churches and mon- 
asteries furnished their contingent; a sacrilegious profit was extorted 
from the sale of ecclesiastical honours; and the indigent bishop of Leu- 
cadia 18 was made responsible for a pension of one hundred pieces of 
gold. 19 

But the wealth of the province, and the trust of the revenue, were 
founded on the fair and plentiful produce of trade and manufactures; 
and some symptoms of liberal policy may be traced in a law which 
exempts from all personal taxes the mariners of Peloponnesus, and the 
workmen in parchment and purple. This denomination may be fairly 
applied or extended to the manufactures of linen, woollen, and more 
especially of silk: the two former of which had flourished in Greece since 
the days of Homer; and the last was introduced perhaps as early as the 
reign of Justinian. These arts, which were exercised at Corinth, Thebes, 
and Argos, afforded food and occupation to a numerous people: the men, 
women, and children were distributed according to their age and 
strength; and if many of these were domestic slaves, their masters, who 
directed the work and enjoyed the profit, were of a free and honourable 
condition. The gifts which a rich and generous matron of Peloponnesus 
presented to the emperor Basil, her adopted son, were doubtless fabri-

cated in the Grecian looms. Danidis bestowed a carpet of fine wool, 
of a pattern which imitated the spots of a peacock's tail, of a magnitude 
to overspread the floor of a new church, erected in the triple name of 
Christ, of Michael the archangel, and of the prophet Elijah. She gave 
six hundred pieces of silk and linen, of various use and denomination: 
the silk was painted with the Tyrian dye, and adorned by the labours 
of the needle; and the linen was so exquisitely fine, that an entire piece 
might be rolled in the hollow of a cane. 20 In his description of the 
Greek manufactures, an historian of Sicily discriminates their price, 
according to the weight and quality of the silk, the closeness of the 
texture, the beauty of the colours, and the taste and materials of the 
embroidery. A single, or even a double or treble thread was thought 
sufficient for ordinary sale; but the union of six threads composed a 
piece of stronger and more costly workmanship. Among the colours, 
he celebrates, with affectation of eloquence, the fiery blaze of the scarlet, 
and the softer lustre of the green. The embroidery was raised either in 
silk or gold: the more simple ornament of stripes or circles was sur- 
passed by the nicer imitation of flowers: the vestments that were fabri- 
cated for the palace or the altar often glittered with precious stones; 
and the figures were delineated in strings of Oriental pearls, 21 Till the 
twelfth century, Greece alone, of all the countries of Christendom, was 
possessed of the insect who is taught by nature, and of the workmen 
who are instructed by art, to prepare this elegant luxury. But the 
secret had been stolen by the dexterity and diligence of the Arabs: the 
caliphs of the East and West scorned to borrow from the unbelievers 
their furniture and apparel; and two cities of Spain, Almeria and Lisbon, 
were famous for the manufacture, the use, and perhaps the exportation 
of silk. It was first introduced into Sicily by the Normans; and this 
emigration of trade distinguishes the victory of Roger from the uniform 
and fruitless hostilities of every age. After the sack of Corinth, Athens, 
and Thebes, his lieutenant embarked with a captive train of weavers 
and artificers of both sexes, a trophy glorious to their 'master and dis- 
graceful to the Greek emperor. 22 The king of Sicily was not insensible

of the value of the present; and, in the restitution of the prisoners, he 
excepted only the male and female manufacturers of Thebes and Corinth, 
who labour, says the Byzantine historian, under a barbarous lord, like 
the old Eretrians in the service of Darius. 28 A stately edifice, in the 
palace of Palermo, was erected for the use of this industrious colony; 24 
and the art was propagated by their children and disciples to satisfy 
the increasing demand of the western world. The decay of the looms 
of Sicily may be ascribed to the troubles of the island and the competi- 
tion of the Italian cities. In the year thirteen hundred and fourteen, 
Lucca alone, among her sister republics, enjoyed the lucrative monop- 
oly. 26 A domestic revolution dispersed the manufacturers to Florence, 
Bologna, Venice, Milan, and even the countries beyond the Alps; and 
thirteen years after this event, the statutes of Modena enjoin the plant- 
ing of mulberry-trees and regulate the duties on raw silk. 26 The northern 
climates are less propitious to the education of the silkworm; but the 
industry of France and England 27 is supplied and enriched by the pro- 
ductions of Italy and China. 

I must repeat the complaint that the vague and scanty memorials of 
the times will not afford any just estimate of the taxes, the revenue, 
and the resources of the Greek empire. From every province of Europe 
and Asia the rivulets of gold and Silver discharged into the Imperial 
reservoir a copious and perennial stream. The separation of the 
branches from the trunk increased the relative magnitude of Constan- 
tinople; and the maxims of despotism contracted the state to the capital, 
the capital to the palace, and the palace to the royal person. A Jewish 
traveller, who visited the East in the twelfth century, is lost in his 
admiration of the Byzantine riches. "It is here," says Benjamin of

Tudela, " in the queen of cities, that the tributes of the Greek empire 
are annually deposited, and the lofty towers are filled with precious 
magazines of silk, purple, and gold. It is said that Constantinople pays 
each day to her sovereign twenty thousand pieces of gold, which are 
levied on the shops, taverns, and markets, on the merchants of Persia 
and Egypt, of Russia and Hungary, of Italy and Spain, who frequent 
the capital by sea and land." 2S In all pecuniary matters the authority 
of a Jew is doubtless respectable; but as the three hundred and sixty- 
five days would produce a yearly income exceeding seven millions 
sterling, I am tempted to retrench at least the numerous festivals of the 
Greek calendar. The mass of treasure that was saved by Theodora and 
Basil the Second will suggest a splendid, though indefinite, idea of their 
supplies and resources. The mother of Michael, before she retired to 
a cloister, attempted to check or expose the prodigality of her ungrateful 
son by a free and faithful account of the wealth which he inherited; one 
hundred and nine thousand pounds of gold and three hundred thousand 
of silver., the fruits of her own economy and that of her deceased hus- 
band. 29 The avarice of Basil is not less renowned than his valour and 
fortune: his victorious armies were paid and rewarded without break- 
ing into the mass of two hundred thousand pounds of gold (about eight 
millions sterling) , which he had buried in the subterraneous vaults of the 
palace. 30 Such accumulation of treasure is rejected by the theory and 
practice of modern policy; and we are more apt to compute the national 
riches by the use and abuse of the public credit. Yet the ma.xims of 
antiquity are still embraced by a monarch formidable to his enemies; 
by a republic respectable to her allies; and both have attained their 
respective ends of military power and domestic tranquillity. 

Whatever might be consumed for the present wants or reserved for 
the future use of the state, the first and most sacred demand was for 
the pomp and pleasure of the emperor; and his discretion only could 
define the measure of his private expense. The princes of Constantinople 
were far removed from the simplicity of nature; yet, with the revolving 
seasons, they were led by taste or fashion to withdraw to a purer air 
from the smoke and tumult of the capital. They enj&amp;yed, or affected 
to enjoy, the rustic festival of the vintage: their leisure was amused by 
the exercise of the chase and the calmer occupation of fishing; and in 
the summer heats they were shaded from the sun, and refreshed by the 
cooling breezes from the sea. Hie coasts and islands of Asia and

Europe were covered with their magnificent villas; but instead of the 
modest art which secretly strives to hide itself and to decorate the scenery 
of nature, the marble structure of their gardens served only to expose 
the riches ol the lord and the labours of the architect. The successive 
casualties of inheritance and forfeiture had rendered the sovereign pro- 
prietor of many stately houses in the city and suburbs, of which twelve 
were appropriated to the ministers of state; but the great palace, 81 the 
centre of the Imperial residence, was fixed during eleven centuries to 
the same position, between the hippodrome, the cathedral of St. Sophia, 
and the gardens, which descended by many a terrace to the shores of the 
Propontis. The primitive edifice of the first Constantine was a copy, 
or rival, of ancient Rome; the gradual improvements of his successors 
aspired to emulate the wonders of the old world, 82 and in the tenth 
century the Byzantine palace excited the admiration, at least of the 
Latins, by an unquestionable pre-eminence of strength, size, arid mag- 
nificence. 83 But the toil and treasure of so many ages had produced a 
vast and irregular pile: each separate building was marked with the 
character of the times and of the founder; and the want of space might 
excuse the reigning monarch who demolished, perhaps with secret satis- 
faction, the works of his predecessors. The economy of the emperor 
Theophilus allowed a more free and ample scope for his domestic luxury 
and splendour. A favourite ambassador, who had astonished the Abbas- 
sides themselves by his pride and liberality, presented on his return the 
model of a palace which the caliph of Bagdad had recently constructed 
on the banks of the Tigris. The model was instantly copied and sur- 
passed: the new buildings of Theophilus 84 were accompanied with gar-

[There is one fact with regard to the Byzantine finance which deserves 
to be mentioned. From the fall of the Western Roman empire in 476 to 
the conquest of Constantinople by the Crusaders in 1204, the gold coinage 
of the empire was maintained constantly of the same weight and standard. 
The concave gold byzants (bezants) of Isaac II. were precisely of the same 
weight and value as the solidus of Leo the Great and Zeno the Isaurian. Gold 
was the circulating medium of the empire, and the purity of the Byzantine 
coinage rendered it for many centuries the only gold currency that circulated

dens and with five churches, one of which was conspicuous for size and 
beauty: it was crowned with three domes, the roof of gilt brass reposed 
on columns of Italian marble, and the walls were incrusted with marbles 
of various colours. In the face of the church a semicircular portico, of 
the figure and name of the Greek sigma, was supported by fifteen col- 
umns of Phrygian marble, and the subterraneous vaults were of a similar 
construction. The square before the sigma was decorated with a foun- 
tain, and the margin of the basin was lined and encompassed with plates 
of silver. In the beginning of each season the basin, instead of water, 
was replenished with the most exquisite fruits, which were abandoned 
to the populace for the entertainment of the prince. He enjoyed this 
tumultuous spectacle from a throne resplendent with gold and gems, 
which was raised by a marble staircase to the height of a lofty terrace. 
Below the throne were seated the officers of his guards, the magistrates, 
the chiefs of the factions of the circus; the inferior steps were occupied 
by the people, and the place below was covered with troops of dancers, 
singers, and pantomimes. The square was surrounded by the hall of 
justice, the arsenal, and the various offices of business and pleasure; 
and the pur fie chamber was named from the annual distribution of 
robes of scarlet and purple by the head of the empress herself. The 
long series of the apartments was adapted to the seasons, and decorated 
with marble and porphyry, with painting, sculpture, and mosaics, with 
a profusion of gold, silver, and precious stones. His fanciful magnificence 
employed the skill and patience of such artists as the times could afford; 
but the taste of Athens would have despised their frivolous and costly 
labours; a golden tree, with its leaves and branches, which sheltered 
a multitude of birds warbling their artificial notes, and two lions of 
massy gold, and of the natural size, who looked and roared like their 
brethren of the forest. The successors of Theophilus, of the Basilian 
and Comnenian dynasties, were not less ambitious of leaving some 
memorial of their residence; and the portion of the palace most splendid 
and august was dignified with the title of the golden trictinnim** With 
becoming modesty the rich and noble Greeks aspired to imitate their 
sovereign, and when they passed through the streets on horseback, in 
their robes of silk and embroidery, they were mistaken by the children 
for kings. 88 A matron of Peloponnesus, 37 who had cherished the infant

fortunes of Basil the Macedonian, was excited by tenderness or vanity 
to visit the greatness of her adopted son. In a journey of five hundred 
miles from Patras to Constantinople, her age or indolence declined the 
fatigue of a horse or carriage; the soft litter or bed of Danielis was 
transported on the shoulders of ten robust slaves, and, as they were 
relieved at easy distances, a band of three hundred was selected for the 
performance of this service. She was entertained in the Byzantine 
palace with filial reverence and the honours of a queen; and whatever 
might be the origin of her wealth, her gifts were not unworthy of the 
regal dignity. I have already described the fine and curious manufac- 
tures of Peloponnesus, of linen, silk, and woollen ; but the most acceptable 
of her presents consisted in three hundred beautiful youths, of whom 
one hundred were eunuchs; 88 "for she was not ignorant," says the 
historian, " that the air of the palace is more congenial to such insects, 
than a shepherd's dairy to the flies of the summer." During her lifetime 
she bestowed the greater part of her estates in Peloponnesus, and her 
testament instituted Leo, the son of Basil, her universal heir. After the 
payment of the legacies, fourscore villas or farms were added to the 
Imperial domain, and three thousand slaves of Danielis were enfran- 
chised by their new lord, and transplanted as a colony to the Italian 
coast. From this example of a private matron we may estimate the wealth 
and magnificence of the emperors. Yet our enjoyments are confined by a 
narrow circle, and, whatsoever may be its value, the luxury of life is 
possessed with more innocence and safety by the master of his own, 
than by the steward of the public, fortune. 

In an absolute government, which levels the distinctions of noble 
and plebeian birth, the sovereign is the sole fountain of honour; and 
the rank, both in the palace and the empire, depends on the titles and 
offices which are bestowed and resumed by his arbitrary will. Above 
a thousand years, from Vespasian to Alexius Comnenus, 89 the C&amp;sar 
was the second person, or at least the second degree, after the supreme 
title of Augustus was more freely communicated to the sons and brothers 
of the reigning monarch. To dude without violating his promise to a 
powerful associate, the husband of his sister, and, without giving him- 
self an equal, to reward the piety of his brother Isaac, the crafty Alexius 
interposed a new and supereminent dignity. The happy flexibility of the 
Greek tongue allowed him to compound the names of Augustus and

Emperor (Sebastos and Autocrator), and the union produced the sono- 
rous title of Sebastocrator. He was exalted above the Caesar on the first 
step of the throne: the public acclamations repeated his name; and he 
was only distinguished from the sovereign by some peculiar ornaments 
of the head and feet. The emperor alone could assume the purple or 
red buskins, and the close diadem or tiara, which imitated the fashion 
of the Persfan kings. 40 It was a high pyramidal cap of doth or silk, 
almost concealed by a profusion of pearls and jewels: the crown was 
formed by a horizontal circle and two arches of gold: at the summit, 
the point of their intersection, was placed a globe or cross, and two 
strings or lappets of pearl depended on either cheek. Instead of red, 
the buskins of the Sebastocrator and Caesar were green; and on their 
open coronets, or crowns, the precious gems were more sparingly dis- 
tributed. Beside and below the Caesar the fancy of Alexius created the 
Pankypersebastos and the Protosebastos, whose sound and signification 
will satisfy a Grecian ear. They imply a superiority and a priority above 
the simple name of Augustus; and this sacred and primitive title of the 
Roman prince was degraded to the kinsmen and servants of the Byzan- 
tine court. The daughter of Alexius applauds with fond complacency 
this artful gradation of hopes and honours; but the science of words is 
accessible to the meanest capacity; and this vain dictionary was easily 
enriched by the pride of his successors. To their favourite sons or 
brothers they imparted the more lofty appellation of Lord or Despot, 
which was illustrated with new ornaments and prerogatives, and placed 
immediately after the person of the emperor himself. The five titles 
of, i. Despot; 2. Sebastocrator; 3. C&amp;sar; 4. Panhypersebastos; and, 
5. Protosebastos ; were usually confined to the princes of his blood: they 
were the emanations of his majesty; but as they exercised no regular 
functions, their existence was useless, and their authority precarious. 

But in every monarchy the substantial powers of government must 
be divided and exercised by the ministers of the palace and treasury, 
the fleet and army. The titles alone can differ; and in the revolution 
of ages, the counts and prefects, the praetor and quaestor, insensibly 
descended, while their servants rose above their heads to the first 
honours of the state, i. In a monarchy, which refers every object to 
the person of the prince, the care and ceremonies of the palace form 
the most respectable department. The Curopalata^ so illustrious in

the age of Justinian, was supplanted by the Protovestiare, whose primi-

thence his jurisdiction was extended over the numerous menials of 
pomp and luxury; and he presided with his silver wand at the public 
and private audience. 2. In the ancient system of Constantine, the 
name of Logothete, or accountant, was applied to the receivers of the 
finances: the principal officers were distinguished as the Logothetes of 
the domain, of the posts, the army, the private and public treasure;

hi due subordination, by the eparch or prefect of the city, the first 
secretary, and the keepers of the privy seal, the archives, and the red

emperor alone. 4 ' The introductor and interpreter of foreign ambassa- 
dors were the great Chiauss" and the Dragoman** two names of

sensibly rose to the station of generals; the military themes of the 
East and West, the legions of Europe and Asia, were often divided, 
till the great Domestic was finally invested with the universal and abso- 
lute command of the land forces. The Protostrator, in his original func- 
tions, was the assistant of the emperor when he mounted on horseback: 
he gradually became the lieutenant of the great Domestic in the field; 
and his jurisdiction extended over the stables, the cavalry, and the royal 
train of hunting and hawking. The Stratopedarch was the great judge 
of the camp: the Protospdthaire commanded the guards; the C0#-

of the Franks, the barbarians, and the Varangi, or English, the mer- 
cenary strangers, who, in the decay of the national spirit, formed the 
nerve of the Byzantine armies. 4. The naval powers were under the 
command of the great Duke; in his absence they obeyed the great Drun- 
gaire of the fleet; and, in his place, the Emir, or Admiral, a name of 
Saracen extraction,* 7 but which has been naturalised in all the modern 
languages of Europe. Of these officers, and of many more whom it 
would be useless to enumerate, the civil and military hierarchy was 
framed. Their honours and emoluments, their dress and titles, their 
mutual salutations and respective pre-eminence, were balanced witk 
more exquisite labour than would have fixed the constitution of a free 
people; and the code was almost perfect when this baseless fabric, the 
monument of pride and servitude, was for ever buried in the ruins of the 
empire. 48 

The most lofty titles, and the most humble postures, which devotion 
has applied to the Supreme Being, have been prostituted by flattery and 
fear to creatures of the same nature with ourselves* The mode of 
adoration,** of falling prostrate on the ground and kissing the feet of the 
emperor, was borrowed by Diodetiaai from Persian servitude; but it 
was continued and aggravated till the last age of the Greek monarchy. 
Excepting only on Sundays, when it was waived, from a motive of re- 
ligious pride, this humiliating reverence was exacted from all who en- 
tered the royal presence, from the princes invested with the diadem and 
purple, and from the ambassadors who represented their independent 
sovereigns, the caliphs of Asia, Egypt^ or Spain, the kings of France 
and Italy, and the Latin emperors of ancient Rome. In his transac- 
tions of business, Liutprand, bishop of Cremona, 50 asserted the free 
spirit of a Frank and the dignity of his master Otho. Yet his sincerity 
cannot disguise the abasement of his first audience. When he ap- 
proached the throne, the birds of the golden tree began to warble .their 
notes, which ware accompanied by the roarings of the two lions of gold. 
With his two companions Liutprand was compelled to bow. and to fall 
prostrate; and thrice he touched the ground with his forehead. He 
arose; but in the short interval the throne had been hoisted by an engine 
from the floor to the ceiling, the Imperial figure appeared in new and

more gorgeous apparel, and the interview was concluded in haughty 
and majestic silence. In this honest and curious narrative the bishop 
of Cremona represents the ceremonies of the Byzantine court, which are 
still practised in the Sublime Porte, and which were preserved in the 
last age of the dukes of Muscovy or Russia. After a long journey by 
the sea and land, from Venice to Constantinople, the ambassador halted 
at the golden gate, till he was conducted by the formal officers to the 
hospitable palace prepared for his reception; but this palace was a 
prison, and his jealous keepers prohibited all social intercourse either 
with strangers or natives. At his first audience he offered the gifts of 
his master slaves, and golden vases, and costly armour. The osten- 
tatious payment of the officers and troops displayed before his eyes the 
riches of the empire: he was entertained at a royal banquet, 51 hi which 
the ambassadors of the nations were marshalled by the esteem or con- 
tempt of the Greeks: from his own table, the emperor, as the most signal 
favour, sent the plates which he had tasted; and his favourites were 
dismissed with a robe of honour. 52 In the morning and evening of each 
day his civil and military servants attended their duty in the palace; 
their labour was repaid by the sight, perhaps by the smile, of their lord; 
his commands were signified by a nod or a sign: but all earthly great- 
ness stood silent and submissive in his presence. In his regular or ex- 
traordinary processions through the capital, he unveiled his person to 
the public view: the rites of policy were connected with those of re- 
ligion, and his visits to the principal churches were regulated by the 
festivals of the Greek calendar. On the eve of these processions the 
gracious or devout intention of the monarch was proclaimed by the 
heralds. The streets were cleared and purified; the pavement was 
strewed with flowers; the most precipus furniture, the gold and silver 
plate and silken hangings, were displayed from the windows and bal- 
conies; and a severe discipline restrained and silenced the tumult of the 
populace. The march was opened by the military officers at the head of 
their troops: they were followed hi long order by the magistrates and 
ministers of the civil government: the person of the emperor was 
guarded by his eunuchs and domestics, and at the church door he was 
solemnly received by the patriarch and his dergy. The task of ap- 
plause was not abandoned to the rude and spontaneous voices of the 
crowd. The most convenient stations were occupied by the bands of 
the blue and green factions of the circus; and their furious conflicts,

which had shaken the capital, were insensibly sunk to an emulation of 
servitude. From either side they echoed in responsive melody the 
praises of the emperor; their poets and musicians directed the choir, 
and long life 5S and victory were the burden of every song. The same 
acclamations were performed at the audience, the banquet, and the 
church; and as an evidence of boundless sway, they were repeated in 
the Latin, 54 Gothic, Persian, French, and even English language, 55 by 
the mercenaries who sustained the real or fictitious character of those 
nations. By the pen of Constantine Porphyrogenitus this science of 
form and flattery has been reduced into a pompous and trifling volume, 5 * 
which the vanity of succeeding times might enrich with an ample sup- 
plement. Yet the calmer reflection of a prince would surely suggest 
that the same acclamations were applied to every character and every 
reign: and if he had risen from a private rank, he might remember 
that his own voice had been the loudest and most eager in applause, at 
the very moment when he envied the fortune, or conspired against the 
life, of his predecessor. 57 

The princes of the North, of the nations, says Constantine, without 
faith or fame, were ambitious of mingling their blood with the blood 
of the Caesars, by their marriage with a royal virgin, or by the nup- 
tials of their daughters with a Roman prince. 58 The aged monarch, in 
his instructions to his son, reveals the secret maxims of policy and pride, 
and suggests the most decent reasons for refusing these insolent and 
unreasonable demands. Every animal, says the discreet emperor, is 
prompted by nature to seek a mate among the animals of his own 
species; and the human species is divided into various tribes, by the 
distinction of language, religion, and manners. A just regard to the 
purity of descent preserves the harmony of public and private life; but

tie mixture of foreign blood is the fruitful source of disorder and dis- 
cord. Such had ever been the opinion and practice of the sage Romans: 
their jurisprudence proscribed the marriage of a citizen and a stranger: 
in the days of freedom and virtue a senator would have scorned to match 
his daughter with a king: the glory of Mark Antony was sullied by an 
Egyptian wife: 6 * and the emperor Titus was compelled, by popular 
censure, to dismiss with reluctance the reluctant Berenice. 60 This per- 
petual interdict was ratified by the fabulous .sanction of the great Con- 
stantine. The ambassadors of the nations, more especially of the un- 
believing nations, were solemnly admonished that such strange alliances 
had been condemned by the founder of the church and city. The irrev- 
ocable law was inscribed on the altar of St. Sophia; and the impious 
prince who should stain the majesty of the purple was excluded from the 
civil and ecclesiastical communion of the Romans. If the ambassadors 
were instructed by any false brethren in the Byzantine history, they 
might produce three memorable examples of the violation of this 
imaginary law: the marriage of Leo, or rather of his father Constantine 
the -Fourth, with the daughter of the king of the Chazars, the nuptials 
of the grand-daughter of Romanus with a Bulgarian prince, and the 
union of Bertfaa of France or Italy with young Roinanus, the son of 
Constantine Porpbyrogenitus himself. To these objections three 
answers were, prepared, wMck .solved tibe difficulty and established the 
law, I. The deed and. the guilt of Constantine Copronymus were 
acknowledged. The Isaurian heretic, who sullied the baptismal font 
and declared war against the holy images, had indeed embraced a bar- 
barian wife. By this impious alliance he accomplished the measure of 
his crimes, and was devoted to the just censure of the church -and of 
posterity. II. Romants could not be alleged as a legitimate emperor; 
he was a plebeian usurper, ignorant of the laws, and regardless of the 
honour, of the monarchy. His son Christopher, the father of the bride, 
was the third in rank in the college of princes, at once the subject and 
the accomplice of a rebellious parent. The Bulgarians were sincere and 
devout Christians; and the safety of the empire, with -the redemption 
of many thousand captives, depended on tills preposterous alliance. 
Yet no consideration could dispense from the law of Constantine: the 
dergy, the senate, and the people disapproved the conduct of Ro- 
manus; and he was reproached, both in his life and -death, as the author 
of the public disgrace. ILL For the marriage of his own son with the

daughter of Hugo, long of Italy, a more honourable defence is contrived 
by the wise Porphyrogenitus. Constantine, the great and holy. 
esteemed the fidelity and valour of the Franks; 61 and his prophetic 
spirit beheld the vision of their future greatness. They alone were ex- 
cepted from the general prohibition: Hugo, king of France, was the 
lineal descendant of Charlemagne; 82 and his daughter, Bertha, in- 
herited the prerogatives of her family and nation. The voice of truth 
and malice insensibly betrayed the fraud or error of the Imperial court- 
The patrimonial estate of Hugo was reduced from the monarchy oi 
France to the simple county of Aries; though it was not denied that, 
in the confusion of the times, he had usurped the sovereignty of Pro- 
vence, and invaded the kingdom of Italy. His father was a private 
noble; and if Bertha derived her female descent from the CarlovingiaB 
line, every step was polluted with illegitimacy or vice. The grand- 
mother of Hugo was the famous Valdrada, the concubine, rather thai? 
the wife, of the second Lothair; whose adultery, divorce, and second 
nuptials had provoked against him the thunders of the Vatican. Hi? 
mother, as she was styled, the great Bertha, was successively the wife o* 
the Count of Aries and of the Marquis of Tuscany: France and Italy 
were scandalised by her gallantries; and, till the age of threescore, her 
lovers, of every degree, were the zealous servants of her ambition. The 
example of maternal incontinence was copied by the king of Italy; and 
the three favourite concubines of Hugo were decorated with the classic 
names of Venus, Juno, and Semele. 6 * The daughter of Venus was 
granted to the solicitations of the Byzantine court: her name of Bertha 
was changed to. that of Eudoxia; and she was weaded, or rather be- 
trothed, to young Romanus, the future heir of the empire of the East. 
The consummation of this foreign alliance was suspended by the tender 
age of the two parties; and, at the end of five years, the union was 
dissolved by the death of the virgin spouse. The second wife of the 
emperor Romanus was a maiden of plebeian, but of Roman., birth; and 
their two daughters, Theophano and Anne, were given in marriage to 
the princes of the earth. The eldest was bestowed, as the pledge of 
peace, on the eldest son of the great Otho, who had solicited this alli- 
ance with arms and embassies. It might legally be questioned how far 



tt Constantine was' made to praise the efryere/a and wepiQapcla of the Franks, 
with whom he claimed a private and public alliance. The French writers 
(Isaac Casaubon in Dedicat. Polybii) are highly delighted with these com- 
pliments.

a Saxon was entitled to the privilege of the French nation; but every 
scruple was silenced, by the fame and piety of a hero who had restored 
the empire of the West. After the death of her father-in-law and hus- 
band, Theophano governed Rome, Italy, and Germany, during the 
minority of her son, the third Otho; and the Latins have praised the 
virtues of an empress who sacrificed to a superior duty the remem- 
brance of her country. 64 In the nuptials of her sister Anne, every 
prejudice was lost, and every consideration of dignity was superseded, 
by the stronger argument of necessity and fear. A Pagan of the North, 
Wolodomir, great prince of Russia, aspired to a daughter of the Roman 
purple; and his claim was enforced by the threats of war, the promise 
of conversion, and the offer of a powerful succour against a domestic 
rebel. A victim of her religion and country, the Grecian princess was 
torn from the palace of her fathers, and condemned to a savage reign 
and a hopeless exile on the banks of the Borysthenes, or in the neigh- 
bourhood of the Polar circle. 05 Yet the marriage of Anne was fortunate 
and fruitful: the daughter of her grandson Jeroslaus was recommended 
by her Imperial descent; and the king of France, Henry I., sought a 
wife on the last borders of Europe and Christendom. 66 

In the Byzantine palace the emperor was the first slave of the cere- 
monies which he imposed, of the rigid forms which regulated each 
word and gesture, besieged him in the palace, and violated the leisure 
of his rural solitude. But the lives and fortunes of millions hung on 
his arbitrary will; and the firmest minds, superior to the allurements of 
pomp and luxury, may be seduced by the more active pleasure of 
commanding their equals. The legislative and executive powers were 
centred in the person of the monarch, and the last remains of the au- 
thority of the senate were finally eradicated by Leo the Philosopher. 07 
A lethargy of servitude had benumbed the minds of the Greeks: in the 
wildest tumults of rebellion they never aspired to the idea of a free

constitution; and the private character of the prince was the only 
source and measure of their public happiness. Superstition riveted 
their chains; in the church of St. Sophia he was solemnly crowned by 
the patriarch; at the foot of the altar they pledged their passive and 
unconditional obedience to his government and family. On his side he 
engaged to abstain as much as possible from the capital punishments 
of death and mutilation; his orthodox creed was subscribed with his 
own hand, and he promised to obey the decrees of the seven synods 
and the canons of tie holy church. 08 But the assurance of mercy 
was loose and indefinite:, he swore, not to his people, but to an invisible 
judge; and except in the inexpiable guilt of heresy, the ministers of 
heaven were always prepared to preach the indefeasible right, and to 
absolve the venial transgressions, of their sovereign. The Greek ecclesi- 
astics were themselves the subjects of the civil magistrate: at the nod 
of a tyrant the bishops were created, or transferred, or deposed, or 
punished with an ignominious death; whatever might be their wealth 
or influence, they could never succeed like the Latin clergy in the 
establishment of an independent republic; and the patriarch of Con- 
stantinople condemned, what he secretly envied, the temporal greatness 
of his Roman brother. Yet the exercise of boundless despotism is 
happily checked by the laws of nature and necessity. In proportion 
to his wisdom and virtue, the master of an empire is confined to the 
path of his sacred and laborious duty. In proportion to his vice and 
folly, he drops the sceptre too weighty for his hands; and the motions 
of the royal image are ruled by the imperceptible thread of some min- 
ister or favourite, who undertakes for his private interest to exercise 
the task of the public oppression. In some fatal moment the most 
absolute monarch may dread the reason or the caprice of a nation of 
slaves; and experience has proved that whatever is gained in the extent 
is lost in the safety and solidity of regal power. 

Whatever titles a despot may assume, whatever claims he may assert, 
it is on the sword that he must ultimately depend to guard him against 
his foreign and domestic enemies. From the age of Charlemagne to 
that of the Crusades the world (for I overlook the remote monarchy 
of China) was occupied and disputed by the three great empires or 
nations of the Greeks, the Saracens, and the Franks. Their military 
strength may be ascertained by a comparison of their courage, their 
arts and riches, and their obedience to a supreme head, who might 
call into action all the energies of the state. The Greeks, far inferior 
to their rivals in the first, were superior to the Franks, and at least 
equal to the Saracens, in the second and third of these warlike quali- 
fications. 

The wealth of the Greeks enabled them to purchase the service of the

poorer nations, and to maintain a navaL power for the protection of 
their coasts and the annoyance of their enemies. 69 A commerce of 
mutual benefit exchanged the gold of Constantinople for the blood of 
the Sdavonians and Turks, the Bulgarians and Russians: their valour 
contributed to the victories of Nicephorus and Zimisces; and if a 
hostile people pressed too closely on the frontier, they were recalled 
to the defence of their country, and the desire of peace, by the well- 
managed attack of a more distant tribe. 70 The command of the Medi- 
terranean, from the mouth of the Tanais to the Columns of Hercules, 
was always claimed, and often possessed, by the successors of Con- 
stantine. Their capital was filled with naval stores and dexterous 
artificers: the situation of Greece and Asia, the long coasts, deep gulfs, 
and numerous islands, accustomed their subjects to the exercise of 
navigation; and the trade of Venice and Amalfi supplied a nursery of 
seamen to the Imperial fleet. 71 Since the time of the Peloponnesian 
and Punic wars, the sphere of action had not been enlarged; and the 
science of naval architecture appears to have declined. The art of 
constructing those stupendous machines which displayed three, or six, 
or ten ranges of oars, rising above, or falling behind, each other, was 
unknown to the shipbuilders of Constantinople, as well as to the 
mechanicians of modern days. 72 The Dromones?* or light galleys of 
the Byzantine empire, were content with two tier of oars; each tier was 
composed of five-and-twenty benches; and two rowers were seated on 
ach bench, who plied their oars on either side of the vessel. To these 
we must add the captain or centurion, who, in time of action, stood 
erect with his armour-bearer on the poop, two steersmen at the helm, 

"If we listen to the threats of Nicephorus to the ambassador of Otho, 
Nee est in mari domino tuo classium numerus. Navigantium fortitude mihi 
soli inest, qui eum classibus aggrediar, bello maritimas ejus civitates demoliar ; 
t quae fluminibus sunt vicina redigam in favillam. (Liutprand in Legat 
jad Nicephorum Phocam, in Muratori Scriptores Rerum Italicarum, torn. ii. 
pars. i. p. 481.) He observes, in another place, qui caeteris praestant Venetici

culcate the same policy.

p. 825-848), which is given more correct from a manuscript of Gudius, by 
the laborious Fabricius (Biblioth.. Grsec. torn. vi. p. 372-379), relates to the

were applied to a floating palace, whose tonnage, according to Dr. Arbuthnot 
(Tables of Ancient Coins, etc. p. 231-236), is compared as 4^ to i, with 
an English loo-gun ship. 

"The Dromones of Leo, etc., are so clearly described with two tier of 
oars, that I must censure the version of Meursius and Fabricius, who pervert 
the sense by a blind attachment to the classic appellation of Triremes. The 
Byzantine historians are sometimes guilty of the same inaccuracy.

and two officers at the prow, the one to manage the anchor, the other 
to point and play against the enemy the tube of liquid fire. The whole 
crew, as in the infancy of the art, performed the double service of 
mariners and soldiers; they were provided with defensive and offensive 
arms with bows and arrows, which they used from the upper deck; 
with long pikes, which they pushed through the port-holes of the lower 
tier. Sometimes, indeed, the ships of war were of a larger and more 
solid construction; and the labours of combat and navigation were more 
regularly divided between seventy soldiers and two hundred and thirty 
mariners. But for the most part they were of the light and manageable 
size; and as the cape of Malea in Peloponnesus was still dothed with 
its ancient terrors, an Imperial fleet was transported five miles over 
land across the Isthmus of Corinth. 74 The principles of maritime 
tactics had not undergone any change since the time of Thucydides: a 
squadron of galleys still advanced in a crescent, charged to the front, 
and strove to impel their sharp beaks against the feeble sides of their 
antagonists. A machine for casting stones and darts was built of strong 
timbers in the midst of the deck; and the operation of boarding was 
effected by a crane that hoisted baskets of armed men. The language 
of signals, so dear and copious in the naval grammar of the moderns, 
was imperfectly expressed by the various positions and colours of a 
commanding flag. In the darkness of the night the same orders to 
chase, to attack, to halt, to retreat, to break, to form, were conveyed 
by the lights of the leading galley. By land, the fire-signals were re- 
peated, from one mountain to another; a chain of eight stations com- 
manded a space of five hundred miles; and Constantinople in a few- 
hours was apprised of the hostile motions of the Saracens of Tarsus. 75 
Some estimate may be formed of the power of the Greek emperors by 
the curious and minute detail of the armament which was prepared for 
the reduction of Crete. A fleet of one hundred and twelve galleys, and 
seventy-five vessels of the- Pampfaylian style, was equipped in the capi- 
.tal, the islands of the ^Egean Sea, and the seaports of Asia, Mace- 
donia, and Greece. It carried thirty-four thousand mariners, seven 
thousand three hundred and forty soldiers, seven hundred Russians, 
and five thousand and eighty-seven Mardaites, whose fathers had been 
transplanted from the mountains of Libanus. Their pay, most prob- 
ably of a month, was computed at thirty-four centenaries of gold, about

one hundred and thirty-six thousand pounds sterling. Our fancy is 
bewildered by the endless recapitulation of arms and engines, of clothes 
and linen, of bread for the men and forage for the horses, and of stores 
and utensils of every description, inadequate to the conquest of a petty 
island, but amply sufficient for the establishment of a flourishing 
colony. 

The invention of the Greek fire did not, like that of gunpowder, pro- 
duce a total revolution in the art of war. To these liquid combustibles 
the city and empire of Constantine owed their deliverance; and they 
vrere employed in sieges and sea-fights with terrible effect. But they 
were either less improved, or less susceptible of improvement: the en- 
gines of antiquity, the catapultae, balistse, and battering-rams, were 
still of most frequent and powerful use in the attack and defence of 
fortifications; nor was the decision of battles reduced to the quick and 
heavy fire of a line of infantry, whom it were fruitless to protect with 
armour against a similar fire of their enemies. Steel and iron were still 
the common instruments of destruction and safety; and the helmets, 
cuirasses, and shields of tie tenth century did not, either in form or 
substance, essentially differ from those which had covered the com- 
panions of Alexander or Achilles. 77 But instead of accustoming the 
modern Greeks, like the legionaries of old, to the constant and easy 
use of this salutary weight, their armour was laid aside in light chariots, 
which followed the march, till, on the approach of an enemy, they re- 
sumed with haste and reluctance the unusual encumbrance. Their of- 
fensive weapons consisted of swords, battle-axes, and spears; but the 
Macedonian pike was shortened a fourth of its length, and reduced to 
the more convenient measure of twelve cubits or feet. The sharpness 
of the Scythian and Arabian arrows had been severely felt; and the 
emperors lament the decay of archery as a cause of the public misfor- 
tunes, and recommend, as an advice and a command, that the mili- 
tary youth, till the age of forty, should assiduously practise the exer- 
cise of the bow. 78 The bands, or regiments, were usually three hundred 
strong; and, as a medium between the extremes of four and sixteen, the 
foot-soldiers of Leo and Constantine were formed eight deep; but the 
cavalry charged in four ranks, from the reasonable consideration that 
the weight of the front could not be increased by any pressure of the

consistencies in different parts of this account ; but they are not more obscure 
or more stubborn than the establishment and effectives, the present and fit

in proper hands the knowledge of these profitable mysteries.

hindmost horses. If the ranks of the infantry or cavalry were some- 
times doubled, this cautious array betrayed a secret distrust of the cour- 
age of the troops, whose numbers might swell the appearance of the 
line, but of whom only a chosen band would dare to encounter the 
spears and swords of the barbarians. The order of battle must have 
varied according to the ground, the object, and the adversary; but 
their ordinary disposition, in two lines and a reserve, presented a suc- 
cession of hopes and resources most agreeable to the temper as well as 
the judgment of the Greeks. 79 In case of a repulse, the first line fell 
back into the intervals of the second; and the reserve, breaking into 
two divisions, wheeled round the flanks to improve the victory or cover 
the retreat. Whatever authority could enact was accomplished, at 
least in theory, by the camps and marches, the exercises and evolu* 
tions, the edicts and books, of the Byzantine monarch. 80 Whatever 
art could produce from the forge, the loom, or the laboratory, was 
abundantly supplied by the riches of the prince and the industry of his 
numerous workmen. But neither authority nor art could frame the 
most important machine, the soldier himself; and if the ceremonies of 
Constantine always suppose the safe and triumphal return of the em- 
peror, 81 his tactics seldom soar above the means of escaping a defeat 
and procrastinating the war. 82 Notwithstanding some transient suc- 
cess, the Greeks were sunk in their own esteem and that of their neigh- 
bours. A cold hand and a loquacious tongue was the vulgar description 
of the nation; the author of the Tactics was besieged in his capital; 
and the last of the barbarians, who trembled at the name of the Sara- 
cens or Franks, could proudly exhibit the medals of gold and silver 
which they had extorted from the feeble sovereign of Constantinople. 
What spirit their government and character denied might have been 
inspired, in some degree, by the influence of religion; but the religion 
of the Greeks could only teach them to suffer and to yield. The em- 
peror Nicephorus, who restored for a moment the discipline and glory 
of the Roman name, was desirous of bestowing the honours of martyr- 
dom on the Christians who lost their lives in a holy war against the in- 
fidels. But this political law was defeated by the opposition of the

**In the preface to his Tactics, Leo very freely deplores the loss of dis- 
cipline and the calamities of the times, and repeats, without scruple (Proem. 
P- 357) the reproaches of &lt;fyi&amp;, drala t &amp;yv/&amp;curia, 5X/a etc., nor does it 
appear that the same censures were less deserved in the next generation by 
the disciples of Constantine.

patriarch, the bishops, and the principal senators; and they strenu- 
ously urged the canons of St. Basil, that all who were polluted by the 
-bloody trade of a soldier should be separated, during three years, from 
the communion of the faithful. 83 

These scruples of the Greeks have been compared with the tears of 
the primitive Moslems when they were held back from battle; and this 
contrast of base superstition and high-spirited enthusiasm unfolds to 
a philosophic eye the history of the rival nations. The subjects of the 
last caliphs 84 had undoubtedly degenerated from the zeal and faith of 
the companions of the prophet. Yet their martial creed represented the 
Deity as the author of war; 85 the vital though latent spark of fanaticism 
still glowed in the heart of their religion, and among the Saracens who 
dwelt on the Christian borders it was frequently rekindled to a lively 
and active flame. Their regular force was formed of the valiant slaves 
who had been educated to guard the person and accompany the stand- 
ard of their lord; but the Musulman people of Syria and Cilicia, of 
Africa and Spain, was awakened by the trumpet which proclaimed a 
holy war against the infidels. The rich were ambitious of death or 
victory in the cause of God; the poor were allured by the hopes of 
plunder; and the old, the infirm, and the women assumed their share 
of meritorious service by sending their substitutes, with arms and 
horses, into the field. These offensive and defensive arms were simila 
in strength and temper to those of the Romans, whom they far excelled 
in the management of the horse and the bow; the massy silver of their 
"belts, their bridles, and their swords displayed the magnificence of a 
prosperous nation; and, except some black archers of the South, the 
Arabs disdained the naked bravery of their ancestors. Instead of 
waggons they were attended by a long train of. camels, mules, and 
asses; the multitude of these animals, whom they bedecked with flags 
and streamers, appeared to swell the pomp and magnitude of their 
host, and the horses of the enemy were often disordered by the uncouth 
figure and odious smell of the camels of the East. Invincible by their 
patience of thirst and heat, their spirits were frozen by a winter's cold, 
aiid the consciousness of their propensity to sleep exacted the most 
rigorous precautions against the surprises of the night. Their order of 
battle was a long square of two deep and solid lines; the first of 
archers, the second of cavalry. In their engagements by sea and land

of Nicephorus, must unfortunately apply the epithet of yevvatus to the op- 
position of the patriarch. 

.**The eighth chapter of the tactics of the different nations is the most 
historical and useful of the whole collection of Leo. The manners and arms

they sustained with patient firmness the fury of the attack, and seldom 
advanced to the charge till they could discern and oppress the lassi- 
tude of their foes. But if they were repulsed and broken, they knew 
not how to rally or renew the combat, and their dismay was heightened 
by the superstitious prejudice that God had declared himself on the 
side of their enemies. The decline and fall of the caliphs countenanced 
this fearful opinion, nor were there wanting, among the Mohammedans 
and Christians, some obscure phophecies 8&lt;s which prognosticated their 
alternate defeats. The unity of the Arabian empire was dissolved, but 
the independent fragments were equal to populous and powerful king- 
doms, and in their naval and military armaments an emir of Aleppo 
or Tunis might command no despicable fund of skill, and industry, and 
treasure. In their transactions of peace and war with the Saracens* 
the princes of Constantinople too often felt that these barbarians had 
nothing barbarous in their discipline, and that, if they were destitute 
of original genius, they had been endowed with a quick spirit of 
curiosity and imitation. The model was indeed more perfect than the 
copy; their ships, and engines, and fortifications were of a less skilful 
construction; and they confess, without shame, that the same God who 
has given a tongue to the Arabians had more nicely fashioned the hands 
of the Chinese and the heads of the Greeks. 81 

A name of some German tribes between the Rhine and the Weser 
had spread, its victorious influence over the greatest part of Gaul, Ger- 
many, and Italy; and the common appellation of FRANKS 8S was ap- 
plied by the Greeks and Arabians to the Christians of the Latin drarcb, 
the nations of lie West, who stretched beyond their knowledge to the 
shores of the Atlantic Ocean. The vast body had been inspired and 
united by the soul of Charlemagne; but the division and degeneracy 
of his race soon annihilated the Imperial power, which would have 
rivalled the Caesars of Byzantium, and revenged the indignities of the 
Christian name. The enemies no longer feared, nor could the subjects 
any longer trust, the application of a public revenue, the labours of 
trade and manufactures in the military service, the mutual aid of 
provinces and armies, and the naval squadrons which were regularly 
stationed from the mouth of the Elbe to that of the Tiber. In the be-

historical, the future is dark, enigmatical, and erroneous. From this boundary 
of light and shade an impartial critic may commonly determine the date of 
the composition.

Imperio, 1. ii. c. 27, 28) and Eutychius (AnnaL torn. i. p 55, 56), who both 
lived before the Crusades. The testimonies of Abulpharagius (Dynast p. 69)

2 9 2 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

ginning of the tenth century the family of Charlemagne had almost 
disappeared; his monarchy was broken into many hostile and inde- 
pendent states; the regal title was assumed by the most ambitious 
chiefs; their revolt was imitated in a long subordination of anarchy 
and discord; and the nobles of every province disobeyed their sover- 
eign, oppressed their vassals, and exercised perpetual hostilities against 
their equals and neighbours. Their private wars, which overturned the 
fabric of government, fomented the martial spirit of the nation. In 
the system of modern Europe the power of the sword is possessed, at 
least in fact, by five or six mightly potentates; their operations are 
conducted on a distant frontier by an order of men who devote their 
lives to the study and practice of the military art: the rest of the 
country and community enjoys in the midst of war the tranquillity of 
peace, and is only made sensible of the change by the aggravation or 
decrease of the public taxes. In the disorders of the tenth and eleventh 
centuries every peasant was a soldier, and every village a fortification; 
each wood or valley was a scene of murder and rapine; and the lords 
of each castle were compelled to assume the character of princes and 
warriors. To their own courage and policy they boldly trusted for the 
safety of their family, the protection of their lands, and the revenge 
of their injuries; and, like the conquerors of a larger size, they were 
too apt to transgress the privilege of defensive war. The powers of 
the mind and body were hardened by the presence of danger and ne- 
cessity of resolution: the same spirit refused to desert a friend and to 
forgive an enemy; and, instead of sleeping under the guardian care of 
the magistrate, they proudly disdained the authority of the laws. In 
the days of feudal anarchy the instruments of agriculture and art were 
converted into the weapons of bloodshed; the peaceful occupations ci 
civil and ecclesiastical society were abolished or corrupted; and the 
bishop who exchanged his mitre for a helmet was more forcibly urged 
by the manners of .the times than by the obligation of his tenure. 89 
The love of freedom and of arms was felt with conscious pride by the 
Franks themselves, and is observed by the Greeks with some degree of 
amazement and terror. " The Franks," says the emperor Constantine, 
"are bold and valiant to the verge of temerity; and their dauntless 
spirit is supported by the contempt of danger and death. In the field, 
and in close onset, they press to the front and rush headlong against 
the enemy, without deigning to compute either his numbers or their 
own. Their ranks are formed by the firm connections of consanguinity 
and friendship; and their martial deeds are prompted by the desire of 
saving or revenging their dearest companions. In their eyes a retreat 

**0n this subject of ecclesiastical and beneficiary discipline, Father Thom- 
assin (torn. iii. 1. i. c. 40, 45, 46, 47) may be usefully consulted. A general 
kw of Charlemagne exempted the bishops from personal service; but the 
opposite practice, which prevailed from the ninth to the fifteenth century, is 
countenanced by the example or silence of saints and doctors. . . . You 
justify your cowardice by the holy canons, says Ratherius of Verona; the

is a shameful flight, and flight is indelible infamy." * A nation en- 

dowed with such high and intrepid spirit must have been secure of 

victory if these advantages had not been counterbalanced by many 

weighty defects. The decay of their naval power left the Greeks and 

Saracens in possession of the sea for every purpose of annoyance and 

supply. In the age which preceded the institution of knighthood the 

Franks were rude and unskilful in the service of cavalry;* 1 and in all 

perilous emergencies their warriors were so conscious of their igno- 

rance, that they chose to dismount from their horses and fight on foot. 

Unpractised in the use of pikes or of missile weapons, they were en- 

cumbered by the length of their swords, the weight of their armour, 

the magnitude of their shields, and, if I may repeat the satire of the 

meagre Greeks, by their unwieldy intemperance. Their independent 

spirit disdained the yoke of subordination, and abandoned the standard 

of their chief if he attempted to keep the field beyond the term of their 

stipulation or service. On all sides they were open to the snares of 

an enemy less brave but more artful than themselves. They might 

be bribed, for the barbarians were venal; or surprised in the night, 

for they neglected the precautions of a close encampment or vigilant 

sentinels. The fatigues of a summer's campaign exhausted their 

strei^gth and patience, and they sunk in despair if their voracious appe- 

tite was disappointed of a plentiful supply of wine and of food. This 

general character of the Franks was marked with some national and 

local shades, which I should ascribe to accident rather than to climate, 

but which were visible both to natives and to foreigners. An ambassa- 

dor of the great Otho declared, in the palace of Constantinople, that 

the Saxons could dispute with swords better than with pens, and that 

they preferred inevitable death to the dishonour of turning their backs 

to an enemy. 92 It was the glory of the nobles of France that, in their 

humble dwellings, war and rapine were the only pleasure, the sole occu 

pation, of their lives. They affected to deride the palaces, the ban* 

quets, the polished manners of the Italians, who in the estimate of the 

Greeks themselves had degenerated from the liberty and valour of the 

ancient Lombards. 93 

90 In the eighteenth chapter of his Tactics, the emperor Leo has fairly 
stated the military vices and virtues of the Franks (whom Meursius ridicu- 
lously translates by Galli) and the Lombards or Langobards. See likewise 
the twenty-sixth Dissertation of Muratori de Antiquitatibus Italia medn JEvi.

294 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

By the well-known edict of Caracalla, his subjects, from Britain to 
Egypt, were entitled to the name and privileges of Romans, and their 
national sovereign might fix his occasional or permanent residence in 
any province of their common country. In the division of the East 
and West an ideal unity was scrupulously preserved, and in their titles, 
laws, and statutes the successors of Arcadius and Honorius announced 
themselves as the inseparable colleagues of the same office, as the joint 
sovereigns of the Roman world and city, which were bounded by the 
same limits. After the fall of the Western monarchy the majesty of 
the purple resided solely in the princes of Constantinople, and of these 
Justinian was the first who, after a divorce of sixty years, regained the 
dominion of ancient Rome, and asserted, by the right of conquest, the 
august title of Emperor of the Romans. 94 A motive of vanity or dis- 
content solicited one of his successors, Constans the Second, to abandon 
the Thracian Bosphorus and to restore the pristine honours of the 
Tiber: an extravagant project (exclaims the malicious Byzantine), as if 
he had despoiled a beautiful and blooming virgin, to enrich, or rather 
to expose, the deformity of a wrinkled and decrepit matron. 95 But the 
sword of the .Lombards opposed his settlement hi Italy; he entered 
Rome not as a conqueror, but as a fugitive, and, after a visit of twelve 
days, he pillaged and for ever deserted the ancient capital of the 
world. 96 The final revolt and separation of Italy was accomplished 
about two centuries after the conquests of Justinian, and from his 
reign we may date the gradual oblivion of the Latin tongue. That 

in 916, and appears to have been composed in 940, by a native of Venetia, 
discriminates in these verses the manners of Italy and France:

Constantinople, of the camps and tribunals of the East.* 7 But this 
foreign dialect was unknown to the people and soldiers of the Asiatic 
provinces, it was imperfectly understood by the greater part of the 
interpreters of the laws and the ministers of the state. After a short 
conflict, nature and habit prevailed over the obsolete institutions of 
human power: for the general benefit of his subjects Justinian pro- 
mulgated his novels in the two languages, the several parts of his 
voluminous jurisprudence were successively translated, 88 the original 
was^ forgotten, the version was studied, and the Greek, whose intrinsic 
merit deserved indeed the preference, obtained a legal as well as popular 
establishment in the Byzantine monarchy. The birth and residence of 
succeeding princes estranged them from the Roman idiom; Tiberius by 
the Arabs, 88 and Maurice by the Italians, 100 are distinguished as the 
first of the Greek Caesars, as the founders of a new dynasty and empire; 
the silent revolution was accomplished before the death of Heradius, 
and the ruins of the Latin speech were darkly preserved in the terms of 
jurisprudence and the acclamations of the palace. After the restoration 
of the Western empire by Charlemagne and the Othos, the names of 
Franks and Latins acquired an equal signification and extent, and 
these. haughty barbarians asserted, with some justice, their superior 
claim to the language and dominion of Rome. They insulted the aliens 
of the East who had renounced the dress and idiom, of Romans, and 
their reasonable practice will justify the frequent appellation of

Greeks. 101 But this contemptuous appellation was indignantly rejected 
by the prince and people to whom it is applied. Whatsoever changes 
had been introduced by the lapse of ages, they alleged a lineal and un- 
broken succession from Augustus and Constantine; and, in the lowest 
period of degeneracy and decay, the name of ROMANS adhered to the 
last fragments of the empire of Constantinople. 102 

While the government of the East was transacted in Latin, the Greek 
was the language of literature and philosophy, nor could the masters 
of this rich and perfect idiom be tempted to envy the .borrowed learn- 
ing and imitative taste of their Roman disciples. After the fall of 
Paganism, the loss of Syria and Egypt, and the extinction of the 
schools of Alexandria and Aliens, the studies of the Greeks insensibly 
retired to some regular monasteries, and, above all, to the royal college 
of. Constantinople, which was burnt in the reign of Leo the Isaurian. 10 * 
In the pompous style of the age, the president of that foundation was 
named the Sun of Science; his twelve associates, the professors in the 
different arts and faculties, were the twelve signs of the zodiac; a 
library of thirty-six thousand five hundred volumes was open to their 
inquiries; and they could show an ancient manuscript of Homer, on a 
roll of parchment one hundred and twenty feet in length, the intestines, 
as it was fabled, of a prodigious serpent. 10 * But the seventh and eighth 
centuries were a period of discord and darkness; the library was burnt, 
the college was abolished, the Iconoclasts are represented as the foes of 
antiquity, and a savage ignorance and contempt of letters has disgraced 
the princes of the Heradean and Isaurian dynasties. 105 

In the ninth century we trace the first dawnings of the restoration 
of science. 106 After the fanaticism of the Arabs had subsided, the

caliphs aspired to conquer the arts, rather than the provinces, of the 
empire: their liberal curiosity rekindled the emulation of the Greeks, 
brushed away the dust from their ancient libraries, and taught them to 
know and reward the philosophers, whose labours had been hitherto 
repaid by the pleasure of study and the pursuit of truth. The Caesar 
Bardas, the uncle of Michael the Third, was the generous protector of 
letters, a title which alone has preserved his memory and excused his 
ambition. A partide of the treasures of his nephew was sometimes di- 
verted from the indulgence of vice and folly; a school was opened in the 
palace of Magnaura, and the presence of Bardas excited the emulation 
of the masters and students. At their head was the philosopher Leo, 
archbishop of Thessalonica; his profound skill in astronomy and the 
.mathematics was admired by the strangers of the East, and this occult 
science was magnified by vulgar credulity, which modestly supposes 
that all knowledge superior to its own must be the effect of inspiration 
or magic. At the pressing entreaty of the Csesar, his friend, the cele- 
brated Photius, 107 renounced the freedom of a secular and studious life, 
ascended the patriarchal throne, and was alternately excommunicated 
and absolved by the synods of the East and West. By the confession 
even of priestly hatred, no art or science, except poetry, was foreign to 
this universal scholar, who was deep in thought, indefatigable in reading, 
and eloquent in diction. Whilst he exercised the office of protospathaire, 
or captain of the guards, Photius was sent ambassador to the caliph of 
Bagdad. 108 The tedious hours of exile, perhaps of confinement, were 
beguiled by the hasty composition of his Library, a living monument of 
erudition and criticism. Two hundred and fourscore writers, historians, 
orators, philosophers, theologians, are reviewed without any regular 
method; he abridges their narrative or doctrine, apreciates their style 
and character, and judges even the fathers of the church with a discreet 
freedom which often breaks through the superstition of the times. The 
emperor Basil, who lamented the defects of his own education, intrusted 
to the care of Photius his son and successor Leo the Philosopher, and the 
reign of that prince and of his son Constantine Porphyrogenitus forms 
one of the most prosperous eras of the Byzantine literature. By their 
munificence the treasures of antiquity were deposited in the Imperial

transformed by ignorance into a conjurer; yet not so undeservedly, if he 
be the author of the oracles more commonly ascribed to the emperor of the

bricius, Biblioth. Grace, torn, vi, p. 366; torn. xii. p. 781). Quiescant!

relation of his embassy might have ben curious and instructive. But how 
did he procure his books? A library so numerous could neither be found 
at Bagdad, nor transported with his baggage, nor preserved in his memory. 
Yet the last, however incredible, seems to be affirmed by Photius himself.

in such extracts and abridgments as might amuse the curiosity, without 
oppressing the indolence, of the public. Besides the Bas&amp;ics, or code 
of laws, the arts of husbandry and war, of feeding or destroying the 
human species, were propagated with equal diligence; and the history 
of Greece and Rome was digested into fifty-three heads or titles, of 
which two only (of embassies, and of virtues and vices) have escaped 
the injuries of time. In every station the reader might contemplate 
the image of the past world, apply the lesson or warning of .each page, 
and learn to admire, perhaps to imitate, the examples ojf a brighter 
period. I shall not expatiate on the works of the Byzantine Greeks, 
who, by the assiduous study of the ancients, have deserved, in some 
measure, the remembrance and gratitude of the moderns. The scholars 
of the present age may still enjoy the benefit of the philosophical .com- 
monplace-book of Stobaeus, the grammatical and historic lexicon of 
Suidas, the Chiliads of Tzetzes, which comprise six hundred narratives 
in twelve thousand verses, and the commentaries on Homer of Eusta- 
thius archbishop of Thessalonica, who, from his horn of plenty, has 
poured the names and authorities of four hundred writers. From these 
originals, and from the numerous tribe of scholiasts and critics, 109 some 
estimate may be formed of the literary wealth of the twelfth century. 
Constantinople was enlightened by the genius .of Homer and .Demos- 
thenes, of Aristotle and Plato; and in the enjoyment of neglect -of our 
present riches we must envy the generation that could 'Still peruse the 
history of Theopompus, the orations of Hyperides, the comedies tf 
Menander, 11 - and the odes of Alcseus and Sappho. The frequent 
labour of illustration attests not only the existence but the .popularity 
.of the Grecian classics; the general knowledge of the age may .be de- 
duced from the example of two learned females, the empress Eudocia 
and the princess Anna Comnena, who cultivated, in the purple, the arts 
of rhetoric and philosophy. 111 The vulgar dialect of the .city was -gross

and barbarous: a more correct and elaborate style distinguished the 
discourse, or at least the compositions, of the church and palace, which 
sometimes affected to copy the purity of the Attic models. 

In our modern education, the painful though necessary attainment 
of two languages which are no longer living may consume the time and 
damp the ardour of the youthful student. The poets and orators were 
long imprisoned in the barbarous dialects of our Western ancestors, 
devoid of harmony or grace; and their genius, without precept or ex- 
ample, was abandoned to the rude and native powers of their judgment 
and fancy. But the Greeks of Constantinople, after purging away the 
impurities of their vulgar speech, acquired the free use of their ancient 
language, the most happy composition of human art, and a familiar 
knowledge of the sublime masters who had pleased or instructed the 
first of nations. But these advantages only tend to aggravate the re- 
proach and shame of a degenerate people. They held in their lifeless 
hands the riches of their fathers, without inheriting the spirit which 
had created and improved that sacred patrimony: they read, they 
praised, they compiled, but their languid souls seemed alike incapable 
of thought and action. In the revolution of ten centuries, not a single 
discovery was made to exalt the dignity or promote the happiness of 
mankind. Not a single idea has been added to the speculative systems 
of antiquity, and a succession of patient disciples became in their turn 
the dogmatic teachers of the next servile generation. Not a single com- 
position Of history, philosophy, or literature, has been saved from 
oblivion by the intrinsic beauties of style or sentiment, of original 
fancy, or even of successful imitation. In prose, the least offensive of 
the Byzantine, writers are absolved from censure by their naked and 
unpresutning simplicity: but the orators, most eloquent 113 in their own 
conceit, are the farthest removed from the models whom they affect 
to emulate. In every page our taste and reason are wounded by the 
choice of gigantic and obsolete words, a stiff and intricate phraseology, 
the discord of images, the childish play of false or unseasonable orna- 
ment, and the painful attempt to elevate themselves, to astonish the 
reader, and to involve a trivial meaning in the smoke of obscurity and 
exaggeration. Their prose is soaring to the vicious affectation of 
poetry: their poetry is sinking below the flatness and insipidity of 
prose. The tragic, epic, and lyric muses were silent and inglorious: 
the bards of Constantinople seldom rose above a riddle or epigram, * 
panegyric or tale; they forgot even the rules of prosody; and with tbfc 
melody of Homer yet sounding in their ears, they confound all measure 
of feet and syllables in the impotent strains which have received the

name of political or city verses. 118 The minds of the Greeks were 
bound in the fetters of a base and imperious superstition, which extends 
her dominion round the circle of profane science. Their understandings 
were bewildered in metaphysical controversy: in the belief of visions 
and miracles they had lost all principles of moral evidence, and their 
taste was vitiated by the homilies of the monks, an absurd medley of 
declamation and Scripture. Even these contemptible studies were no 
longer dignified by the abuse of superior talents: the leaders of the 
Greek church were humbly content to admire and copy the oracles of 
?ntiquity, nor did the schools or pulpit produce any rivals of the fame 
rf Athanasius and Chrysostom. 114 

In all the pursuits of active and speculative life, the emulation of 
Ftates and individuals is the most powerful spring of the efforts and 
improvements of mankind. The cities of ancient Greece were cast in 
the happy mixture of union and independence, which is repeated on a 
larger scale, but in a looser form, by the nations of modern Europe: 
the union of language, religion, and manners, which renders them the 
spectators and judges of each other's merit: 118 the independence of 
government and interest, which asserts their separate freedom, and 
excites them to strive for pre-eminence in the career of glory. The 
situation of the Romans was less favourable; yet in the early ages of 
the republic, which fixed the national character, a similar emulation was 
kindled among the states of Latium and Italy; and in the arts and 
sciences they aspired to equal or surpass their Grecian masters. The 
empire of the Caesars undoubtedly checked the activity and progress 
of the human mind: its magnitude might indeed allow some scope for 
domestic competition; but when it was gradually reduced, at first to 
the East, and at last to Greece and Constantinople, the Byzantine sub- 
jects were degraded to an abject and languid temper, the natural effect 
of their solitary and insulated state. From the North they were op- 
pressed by nameless tribes of barbarians, to whom they scarcely im- 
parted the appellation of men. The language and religion of the more 
polished Arabs were an insurmountable bar to all social intercourse. 
The conquerors of Europe were their brethren in the Christian faith; 
but the speech of the Franks or Latins was unknown, their . manners 
were rude, and they were rarely connected, in peace or war, with the 
successors of Heraclius. Alone in the universe, the self-satisfied pride 
of the Greeks was not disturbed by the comparison of foreign merit; 
and it is no wonder if they fainted in the race, since they had neither 
competitors to urge their speed, nor judges to crown their victory. The 
nations of Europe and Asia were mingled by the expeditions to the

Origin and Doctrine of the Paulicians Their Persecution by the Greek 
Emperors Revolt in Armenia, etc. -Transplantation into Thrace- 
Propagation in the West The Seeds, Character, and Consequences oj 
the Reformation 

IN the profession of Christianity the variety of national characters may 
be clearly distinguished. The natives of Syria and Egypt abandoned 
their lives ^ to lazy and contemplative devotion: Rome again aspired 
to the dominion of the world; and the wit of the lively and loquacious 
Greeks was consumed in the disputes of metaphysical theology. The 
incomprehensible mysteries of the Trinity and Incarnation, instead of 
commanding their silent submission, were agitated in vehement and 
subtle controversies, which enlarged their faith at the expense, per- 
haps, of their charity and reason. From the council of Nice to the 
end of the seventh century, the peace and unity of the church was in* 
vaded by these spiritual wars; and so deeply did they affect the decline 
and fall of the empire, that the historian has too often been compelled 
to attend the synods, to explore the creeds, and to enumerate the sects, 
of this busy period of ecclesiastical annals. From the beginning of the 
eighth century to the last ages of the Byzantine empire the sound oi 
controversy was seldom heard: curiosity was exhausted, zeal was fa- 
tigued, and in the decrees of six councils the articles of the Catholic 
faith had been irrevocably defined. The spirit of dispute, however 
vain and pernicious, requires some energy and exercise of the mental 
faculties; and the prostrate Greeks were content to fast, to pray, and 
to believe in blind obedience to the patriarch and his clergy. During 
a long dream of superstition the Virgin and the saints, their visions 
and miracles, their relics and images, were preached by the monks, and 
worshipped by the people; and the appellation of people might be ex- 
tended, without injustice, to the first ranks of civil society. At an 
unseasonable moment the Isaurian emperors attempted somewhat 
rudely to awaken their subjects: under their influence reason might 
obtain some proselytes, a far greater number was swayed by interest 
or fear; but the Eastern world embraced or deplored their visible 
deities, and the restoration of images was celebrated as the feast of 
orthodoxy. In this passive and unanimous state the ecclesiastical 
rulers were relieved from the toil, or deprived of the pleasure, of per- 
secution.. The Pagans had disappeared; the Jews were silent and ob- 
scure; the disputes with the Latins were rare and remote hostilities 
against a national enemy; and the sects of Egypt and Syria enjoyed 
a free toleration under the shadow of the Arabian caliphs. About the 



402 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

middle of the seventh century a branch of Manichaeans was selected as 
the victims of spiritual tyranny: their patience was at length exasper- 
ated to despair and rebellion; and their exile has scattered over the 
West the seeds of reformation. These important events will justify 
some inquiry into the doctrine and story of the PAULICIANS ; x and, as 
they cannot plead for themselves, our candid criticism will magnify 
the go.od, and abate or suspect the evil, that is reported by their 
adversaries. 

The Gnostics, who had distracted the infancy, were oppressed by 
the greatness and authority of the church. Instead of emulating or 
surpassing the wealth, learning, and numbers of the Catholics, their 
obscure remnant was driven from the capitals of the East and West, 
and confined to the villages and mountains along the borders of the 
Euphrates. Some vestige of the Marcionites may be detected in the 
fifth century; 2 but the numerous sects were finally lost in the odious 
name of the Manichaeans: and these heretics, who presumed to recon- 
cile the doctrines of Zoroaster and Christ, were pursued by the two 
religions with equal and unrelenting hatred. Under the grandson of 
Heraclius, hi the neighbourhood of Samosata, more famous for the 
birth of Lucian than for the title of a Syrian kingdom, a reformer 
arose, esteemed by the Paulicians as the chosen messenger of truth. 
In his humble dwelling of Mananalis, Constantine entertained a deacon 
who returned from Syrian captivity, and received the inestimable gift 
of the New Testament, which was already concealed from the vulgar 
by the prudence of the Greek, and perhaps of the Gnostic, clergy. 3 
These books became the measure of his studies and the rule of his 
faith; and the Catholics, who dispute his interpretation, acknowledge 
that his text was genuine and sincere. But he attached himself with 
peculiar devotion to the writings and character of St. Paul: the name 
of the Paulicians is derived by their enemies from some unknown and 
domestic teacher; but I am confident that they gloried in their affinity 
to the apostle of the Gentiles. His disciples, Titus, Timothy, Sylvanus; 
Tychichus, were represented by Constantine, and his fellow-labourers: ' 
the names of the apostolic churches were applied to the congregations 

x The errors and virtues of the Paulicians are weighed, with his usual 
judgment and candour, by the learned Mpsheim (Hist Ecclesiast seculum 
ix. p. 311, etc.S. He draws his original intelligence from Photius (contra 
Manichaeos, 1. i.) and Peter Siculus (Hist. Manichaeorum). The first of these 
accounts has not fallen into my hands; the second, which Mosheim prefers, 
I have read in a Lafc'a version inserted in the Maxima Bibliotheca Patrum 
(torn. xvi. p. 754-764) from the edition of the Jesuit Raderus (Ingolstadii, 
1604, in 4to). 

*In the time of Theodoret, the diocese of Cyrrhus, in Syria, contained 
eight hundred villages. Of there, two were inhabited by Arians and Euno- 
mians, and eight by Marcionites, whom the laborious' bishop reconciled to 
the Catholic church (Dupin, Biblioth. Ecclesiastique, torn. iv. p. 81, 82). 

*Nobis profanis ista (sacra Evctngelid) legere non licet sacerdotibus dun- 
taxat, was the first scruple of a Catholic when he was advised to read flic 
Bible (Petr. SicuL p. 761).

which they assembled in Armenia and Cappadocia; and this innocent 
allegory revived the example and memory of the first ages. In the 
Gospel and the Epistles of St. Paul his faithful follower investigated 
the creed of primitive Christianity; and, whatever might be the suc- 
cess, a Protestant reader will applaud the spirit of the inquiry. But if 
the Scriptures of the Paulicians were pure, they were not perfect. Their 
founders rejected the two Epistles of St. Peter,* the apostle of the 
circumcision, whose dispute with their favourite for the observance of 
the law could not easily be forgiven. 5 They agreed with their Gnostic 
brethren in the universal contempt for the Old Testament, the books of 
Moses and the prophets, which have been consecrated by the decrees 
of the Catholic church. With equal boldness, and doubtless with more 
reason, Constantine, the new Sylvanus, disclaimed the visions which 
in so many bulky and splendid volumes had been published by the 
Oriental sects; the fabulous productions of the Hebrew patriarchs and 
the sages of the East; the spurious gospels, epistles, and acts, which in 
the first age had overwhelmed the orthodox code; the theology of 
Manes, and the authors of the kindred heresies; and the thirty genera- 
tions, or aeons, which had been created by the fruitful fancy of Valen- 
tine. The Paulicians sincerely condemned the memory and opinions 
of the Manichaean sect, and complained of the injustice which im- 
pressed that invidious name on the simple votaries of St. Paul and of 
Christ, 

Of the ecclesiastical chain, many links had been broken by the 
Paulician reformers; and their liberty was enlarged, as they reduced 
the number of masters at whose voice profane reason must bow to 
mystery and mirade. The early separation of the Gnostics had pre- 
ceded the establishment of the Catholic worship; and against the 
gradual innovations of discipline and doctrine they were as strongly 
guarded by habit and aversion as by the silence of St. Paul and the 
evangelists. The objects which had been transformed by the magic of 
superstition appeared to the eyes of the Paulicians in their genuine 
and naked colours. An image made without hands was the common 

4 In rejecting the second Epistle of St. Peter, the Paulicians are justified 
by some of the most respectable of the ancients and moderns (see Wetstein 
ad loc., Simon, Kist Critique du Nouveau Testament, c. 17). They likewise 
overlooked the Apocalypse (Petr. Sicul p. 756) ; but as such neglect is not 
imputed as a crime, the Greeks of the ninth century must have been careless 
of the credit and honour of the Revelations. 

5 This contention, which has not escaped the malice of Porphyry, supposes 
some error and passion in one or both of the apostles. By Chrysostom, 
Jerome,, and Erasmus, it is represented as a sham quarrel, a pious fraud, 
for the benefit of the Gentiles and the correction of the "Jews (Middleton's 
Works, vol. ii. p. 1-20).

of Beausobre (Hist. Critique du Manicheisme, torn. L p. 305-437)- Even 
in Africa, St Austin could describe the Manichsean books, tarn multi, tarn 
grandes, tarn pretiosi codices (contra Faust, xiii. 14) ; but he adds, without 
pity, Incendite omnes illas niembranas: and his advice has been rigofously 
followed.

workmanship of a mortal artist, to whose skill alone the wood and 
canvas must be indebted for their merit or value. The miraculous 
relics were a heap of bones and ashes, destitute of life or virtue, or of 
any relation, perhaps, with the person to whom they were ascribed. 
The true and vivifying cross was a piece of sound or rotten timber; 
the body and blood of Christ, a loaf of bread and a cup of wine, the 
gifts of nature and the symbols of grace. The mother of God was de- 
graded from her celestial honours and immaculate virginity; and the 
saints and angels were no longer solicited to exercise the laborious 
office of mediation in heaven and ministry upon earth. In the practice, 
or at least in the theory, of the sacraments, the Paulicians were in- 
clined to abolish all visible objects of worship, and the words of the 
Gospel were, in their judgment, the baptism and communion of the 
faithful. They indulged a convenient latitude for the interpretation 
of Scripture: and as often as they were pressed by the literal sense, 
they could escape to the intricate mazes of figure and allegory. Their 
utmost diligence must have been employed to dissolve the connection 
between the Old and the New Testament; since they adored the latter 
as the orades of God, and abhorred the former as the fabulous and 
absurd invention of men or demons. We cannot be surprised that they 
should have found in the Gospel the orthodox mystery of the Trinity: 
but instead of confessing the human nature and substantial sufferings 
of Christ, they amused their fancy with a celestial body that passed 
through the virgin like water through a pipe; with a fantastic cruci- 
fixion, that eluded the vain and impotent malice of the Jews. A creed 
thus simple and spiritual was not adapted to the genius of the times; 7 
and the rational Christian, who might have been contented with the 
light yoke and easy burden of Jesus and his apostles, was justly of- 
fended that the Paulicians should dare to violate the unity of God, 
the first article of natural and revealed religion. Their belief and their 
trust was in the Father, of Christ, of the human soul, and of the in- 
visible world. But they likewise held the eternity of matter; a stub- 
born and rebellious substance, the origin of a second principle, of an 
active being, who has created this visible world, and exercises his tem- 
poral reign till the final consummation of death and sin. 8 The appear- 
ances of moral and physical evil had established the two principles in 
the ancient philosophy and religion of the East, from whence this doc- 
trinje was transfused to the various swarms of the Gnostics. A thou- 
sand shades may be devised in the nature and character of Ahriman, 
from a rival god to a subordinate demon, from passion and frailty to 
pure and perfect malevolence: but, in spite of our efforts, the goodness 
and the power of Ormusd are placed at the opposite extremities of the

line; and every step that approaches the one must recede in equal 
proportion from the other. 

The apostolic labours of Constantine-Sylvanus soon multiplied the 
number of his disciples, the secret recompense of spiritual ambition. 
The remnant of the Gnostic sects, and especially the Manichaeans of 
Armenia, were united under his standard; many Catholics were con- 
verted or seduced by his arguments; and he preached with success in 
the regions of Pontus 10 and Cappadocia, which had long since imbibed 
the religion of Zoroaster. The Paulician teachers were distinguished 
only by their Scriptural names, by the modest title of Fellow-pil- 
grims, by the austerity of their lives, their zeal or knowledge, and the 
credit of some extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit. But they were 
incapable of desiring, or at least of obtaining, the wealth and honours 
of the Catholic prelacy: such anti-Christian pride they bitterly cen- 
sured: and even the rank of elders or presbyters was condemned as 
an institution of the Jewish synagogue. The new sect was loosely 
spread over the provinces of Asia Minor to the westward of the Eu- 
phrates; six of their principal congregations represented the churches 
to which St. Paul had addressed his epistles; and their founder chose 
his residence in the neighbourhood of Colonia, 11 hi the same district of 
Pontus which had been celebrated by the altars of Bellona u and the 
miracles of Gregory. 18 After a mission of twenty-seven years, Syl- 
vanus, who had retired from the tolerating government of .the Arabs, 
fell a sacrifice to Roman persecution. The laws of the pious em- 
perors, which seldom touched the lives of less odious heretics, pro- 
scribed without mercy or disguise the tenets, the books, and the per-

v. vi.) and Mosheim (Institut. Hist Eccles. and de Rebus Christianis ante 
Constantinum, sec, i. ii. iii.), have laboured to explore and discriminate the 
various systems of the Gnostics on the subject of the two principles. 

10 The countries between the Euphrates and the Halys were possessed above 
350 years by the Medes (HerodoL L i. c, 103) and Persians; and the 
kings of Pontus were of the royal race of the Achsemenides (Sallust Frag- 
ment, L iii. with the French supplement and notes of the President de 
Brosses).

Colonia, on the Lycus above Neo-Caesarea, is named by the Turks Coulei- 
hisar, or Chonac, a populous town in a strong country (D'Anville, Geographic 
Ancienne, torn. iL p. 34; Tournefort, Voyage du Levant, torn. iii. lettre xxi. 

" M The temple of Bellona, at Comana in Pontus, was a powerful and wealthy 
foundation, and the high priest was respected as the second person in the 
kingdom. As the sacerdotal office had been occupied by his mother's family, 
Strabo (1. xii. p. 809, 835, 836, 837 [p- 535,. 557, W, ed. Casaub.]) dwells 
with peculiar complacency on the temple, the worship, and festival, which 
was twice celebrated every year. But the Bellona of Pontus had the features 
and character of the goddess, not of war, but of love.

Sons of the Montanists and Manichseans: the books were delivered 
to the flames; and all who should presume to secrete such writings, or 
to profess such opinions, were devoted to an ignominious death. 14 A 
Greek minister, armed with legal and military powers, appeared at 
Colonia to strike the shepherd, and to reclaim, if possible, the lost 
sheep. By a refinement of cruelty, Simeon placed the unfortunate 
Sylvanus before a line of his disciples, who were commanded, as the 
price of their pardon and the proof of their repentance, to massacre 
their spiritual father. They turned aside from the impious office; the 
stones dropped from their filial hands; and of the whole number only 
one executioner could be found, a new David, as he is styled by the 
Catholics, who boldly overthrew the giant of heresy. This apostate, 
Justus was his name, again deceived and betrayed his unsuspecting 
brethren, and a new conformity to the acts of St. Paul may be found 
ui the conversion of Simeon: like the apostle, he embraced the doctrine 
which he had been sent to persecute, renounced his honours and for- 
tunes, and acquired among the Paulicians the fame of a missionary 
and a martyr. They were not ambitious of martyrdom, 15 but in a 
calamitous period of one hundred and fifty years their patience sus- 
tained whatever zeal could inflict; and power was insufficient to eradi- 
cate the obstinate vegetation of fanaticism and reason. From the 
blood and ashes of the first victims a succession of teachers and congre- 
gations repeatedly arose: amidst their foreign hostilities they found 
leisure for domestic quarrels: they preached, they disputed, they suf- 
fered; and the virtues, the apparent virtues, of Sergius, in a pilgrimage 
of thirty-three years, are reluctantly confessed by the orthodox his- 
torians. 10 The native cruelty of Justinian the Second was stimulated 
by a pious cause; and he vainly hoped to extinguish, in a single con- 
flagration, the name and memory of the Paulicians. By their primitive 
simplicity, their abhorrence of popular superstition, the Iconoclast 
princes might have been reconciled to some erroneous doctrines; but 
they themselves were exposed to the calumnies of the monks, and they 
chose to be the tyrants, lest they should be accused as the accomplices, 
of the Manichseans. Such a reproach has sullied the clemency of 

"Hoc caeterum ad sua egregia facinora, divijii atque orthodox* Imperatores

ectrumque libros, quocunque in loco invent! Assent, flammis tradi; quod siquis 
uspiam eosdem occultasse deprehenderetur, hunc eundem mortis poense addici, 
ej usque bona in fiscum inferri (Petr. Sicul. p. 759). What more could 
bigotry and persecution desire? 

"It should seem that the Paulicians allowed, themselves some latitude of 
equivocation and mental reservation, till the Catholics discovered the pressing 
questions which reduced them to the alternative of apostacy or martyrdom 
(Petr. Sicui. p. 760). 

"The persecution is told by Petrus Siculus (p. 579-763) with satisfaction 
and pleasantry. Justus justa persolvit Simeon was not TITO? but K^TO? (the 
pronunciation of the two vowels must have been nearly the same), a great 
whale that drowned the mariners who mistook him for an island. See like-

Nicephorus, who relaxed in their favour the severity of the penal 
statutes, nor will his character sustain the honour of a more liberal 
motive. The feeble Michael the First, the rigid Leo the Armenian, 
were foremost in the race of persecution; but the prize must doubtless 
be adjudged to the sanguinary devotion of Theodora, who restored the 
images to the Oriental church. Her inquisitors explored the cities and 
mountains of the lesser Asia, and the flatterers of the empress have 
affirmed that, in a short reign, one hundred thousand Paulicians were 
extirpated by the sword, the gibbet, or the flames. Her guilt or merit 
has perhaps been stretched beyond the measure of truth: but if the 
accotmt be allowed, it must be presumed that many simple Iconoclasts 
were punished under a more odious name; and that some who were 
driveta from the church, unwillingly took refuge in the bosom of heresy. 
The racist furious and desperate of rebels are the sectaries of a re- 
ligion long persecuted, and at length provoked. In a holy cause they 
are no longer susceptible of fear or remorse: the justice of their arms 
hardens them against the feelings of humanity; and they revenge their 
fathers' wrongs on the children of their tyrants. Such have been the 
Hussites of Bohemia and the Calvinists of France, and such, in the 
ninth century,, were the Paulidans of Armenia and the adjacent prov- 
inces." They were first awakened to the massacre of a governor 
and bishop, who exercised the Imperial mandate of converting or de- 
strdying the heretics; and the deepest recesses of Mount Argaeus pro- 
tected their independence and revenge. A more dangerous and con- 
suming flame was kindled by the persecution of Theodora, and the revolt 
of Carbeas, a valiant Paulician, who commanded the guards of the 
general of the East. His father had been impaled by the Catholic in- 
qfcisitors; and religion, or at least nature, might justify his desertion 
and reivenge. Five thousand of his brethren were united by the same 
motives; they renounced the allegiance of anti-Christian Rome; a 
Saracen emir introduced Carbeas to the caliph; and the commander of 
the faithful extended his sceptre to the implacable enemy of the Greeks. 
In the mountains between Siwas and Trebizond he founded or fortified 
the city of Tephrke, 18 which is still occupied by a fierce and Bcentioas 
people, and. the neighbouring hills were covered with the PauHdan 
fugitives, who fiow reconciled the use of the Bible and the sword. 
During more than thirty years Asia was afflicted by the calamities of 
foreign and domestic war: in their hostile inroads the disciples of St. 
Paul were joined with those of Mohammed; and the peaceful Chris- 
tians, the aged parent and tender virgin, who were delivered into bar- 
barous servitude, might justly accuse the intolerant spirit of their

and exploits of Carbeas and his Paulicians.

sovereign. So urgent was the mischief, so intolerable the shame, that 
even the dissolute Michael, the son of Theodora, was compelled to 
march in person against the Paulicians: he was defeated under the 
walls of Samosata; and the Roman emperor fled before the heretics 
whom his mother had condemned to the flames. The Saracens fought 
under the same banners, but the victory was ascribed to Carbeas; and 
the captive generals, with more than a hundred tribunes, were either 
released by Ms avarice or tortured by his fanaticism. The valour and 
ambition of Chrysocheir, 10 his successor, embraced a wider circle of 
rapine and revenge. In alliance with his faithful Moslems, he boldly 
penetrated into the heart of Asia; the troops of the frontier and the 
palace were repeatedly overthrown; the edicts of persecution were 
answered by the pillage of Nice and Nicomedia, of Ancyra and Ephe- 
sus; nor could the apostle St. John protect from violation his city and 
sepulchre. The cathedral of Ephesus was turned into a stable for 
mules and horses; and the Paulicians vied with the Saracens in their 
contempt and abhorrence of images and relics. It is not unpleasing to 
observe the triumph of rebellion over the same despotism which has 
disdained the prayers of an injured people. The emperor Basil, the 
Macedonian, was reduced to sue for peace, to offer a ransom for the 
captives, and to request, in the language of moderation and charity, 
that Chrysocheir would spare his fellow-Christians, and content him- 
self with a royal donative of gold and silver and silk garments. " If 
the emperor," replied the insolent faaatic, " be desirous of peace, let 
him abdicate the East, and reign without molestation in the West. If 
he refuse, the servants of the Lord will precipitate him from the 
throne." The reluctant Basil suspended the treaty, accepted the defi- 
ance, and led his army into the land of heresy, which he wasted with 
fire and sword. The open country of the Paulicians was exposed to the 
same calamities which they had inflicted; but when he had explored 
the strength of Tephrice, the multitude of the barbarians, and the 
ample magazines of arms and provisions, he desisted with a sigh from 
the hopeless siege. On his return to Constantinople he laboured, by 
the foundation of convents and churches, to secure the aid of his celes- 
tial patrons, of Michael the archangel and the prophet Elijah; and it 
was his daily prayer that he might live to transpierce, with three 
arrows, the head of his impious adversary. Beyond his expectations, 
She wish was accomplished: after a successful inroad Chrysocheir was 
surprised and slain in his retreat; and the rebel's head was trium- 
phantly presented at the foot of the throne. Qn the reception of this wel- 
come trophy, Basil instantly called for his bow, discharged three arrows 
with unerring aim, and accepted the applause of the court, who hailed

the victory of the royal archer. With Chrysocheir, the glory of the 
Paulicians faded and withered: 20 on the second expedition of the em- 
peror, the impregnable Tephrice was deserted by the heretics, who sued 
for mercy or escaped to the borders. The city was ruined, but the 
spirit of independence survived in the mountains: the Paulicians de- 
fended, above a century, their religion and liberty, infested the Roman 
limits, and maintained their perpetual alliance with the enemies of the 
empire and the Gospel. 

About the middle of the eighth century, Constantine, surnamed Co- 
pronymus by the worshippers of images, had made an expedition into 
Armenia, and found, in the cities of Melitene and TheodosiopoKs, a great 
number of Paulicians, his kindred heretics. As a favour, or punishment, 
he transplanted them from the banks of the Euphrates to Constantinople 
and Thrace; and by this emigration their doctrine was introduced and 
diffused in Europe. 21 If the sectaries of the metropolis were soon mingled 
with the promiscuous mass, those of the country struck a deep root in 
a foreign soil. The Paulicians of Thrace resisted the storms of persecu- 
tion, maintained a secret correspondence with their Armenian brethren, 
and gave aid and comfort to their preachers, who solicited, not with- 
out success, the infant faith of the Bulgarians. 22 In the tenth century 
they were restored and multiplied by a more powerful colony which 
John Zimisces 23 transported from the Chalybian hills to the valleys 
of Mount Haemus. The Oriental clergy, who would have preferred the 
destruction, impatiently sighed for the absence, of the Manichseans: the 
warlike emperor had felt and esteemed their valour: their attachment 
to the Saracens was pregnant with mischief; but, on the side of the 
Danube, against the barbarians of Scythia, their service might be use- 
ful, and their loss would be desirable. Their exile in a distant land was 
softened by a free toleration: the Paulicians held the city of PhOippop- 
olis and the keys of Thrace; the Catholics were then- subjects; the 
Jacobite emigrants their associates: they occupied a line of villages and 
castles in Macedonia and Epirus; and many native Bulgarians were 
associated to the communion of arms and heresy. As long as they were 
awed by power and treated with moderation, their voluntary bands 
were distinguished in the armies of the empire; and the courage of 
these dogs, ever greedy of war, ever thirsty of human blood, is noticed

with astonishment, and almost with reproach, by the pusillanimous 
Greeks. The same spirit rendered them arrogant and contumacious: 
they were easily provoked by caprice or injury; and their privileges 
were often violated by the faithless bigotry of the government and 
clergy. In the midst of the Norman war, two thousand five hundred 
Manichseans deserted the standard of Alexius Comnenus, 24 and retired 
to their native homes. He dissembled till the moment of revenge; in- 
vited the chiefs to a friendly conference; and punished the innocent 
and guilty by imprisonment, confiscation, and baptism. In an interval 
of peace the emperor undertook the pious office of reconciling them to 
the church and state: his winter quarters were fixed at Philippopolis; 
and the thirteenth apostle, as he is styled by his pious daughter, con- 
sumed whole days and nights in theological controversy. His argu- 
ments were fortified, their obstinacy was melted, by the honours and 
rewards which he bestowed on the most eminent proselytes; and a new 
city, surrounded with gardens, enriched with immunities, and dignified 
with his own name, was founded by Alexius, for the residence of his 
vulgar converts. The important station of Philippopolis was wrested 
from their hands; the contumacious leaders were secured in a dungeon, 
Dr banished from their country; and their lives were spared by the pru- 
dence, rather than the mercy, of an emperor, at whose command a poor 
and solitary heretic was burnt alive before the church of St. Sophia. 25 
But the proud hope of eradicating the prejudices of a nation was 
speedily overturned by the invincible zeal of the Paulicians, who ceased 
to dissemble or refused to obey. After the departure and death of 
Alexius they soon resumed their civil and religious laws. In the begin- 
ning of the thirteenth century their pope or primate (a manifest cor- 
ruption) resided on the confines of Bulgaria, Croatia, and Dalmatia, 
and governed by his vicars the filial congregations of Italy and France. 20 
From that era a minute scrutiny might prolong and perpetuate the chain 
of tradition. At the end of the last age the sect or colony still inhabited 
the valleys of Mount Haemus, where their ignorance and poverty were 
more frequently tormented by the Greek clergy than by the Turkish 
government. The modern Paulicians have lost all memory of their 
origin; and their religion is disgraced by the worship of the cross, and 
the practice of bloody sacrifice, which some captives have imported 
from the wilds of Tartary. 27

repulsed by the people or suppressed by the prince. The favour and 
success of the Paulicians in the eleventh and twelfth centuries must be 
imputed to the strong, though secret, discontent which armed the most 
pious Christians against the church of Rome. Her avarice was oppres- 
sive, her despotism odious: less degenerate perhaps th^ the Greeks in 
the worship of saints and images, her innovations were more rapid and 
scandalous: she had rigorously defined and imposed the doctrine of 
transubstantiation: the fives of the Latin clergy were more corrupt, and 
the Eastern bishops might pass for the successors of the apostles if 
they were compared with the lordly prelates who wielded by turns the 
crosier, the sceptre, and the sword. Three different roads might intro- 
duce the Paulicians into the heart of Europe. After the conversion of 
Hungary the pilgrims who visited Jerusalem might safely follow the 
course of the Danube: in their journey and return they passed through 
Philippopolis; and the sectaries, disguising their name and heresy, 
might accompany the French or German caravans to their respective 
countries. The trade and dominion of Venice pervaded the coast of the 
Adriatic, and the hospitable republic opened her bosom to foreigners of 
every climate and religion. Under the Byzantine standard the Pauli- 
cians were often transported to the Greek provinces of Italy and Sicily: 
in peace and war they freely conversed with strangers and natives, and 
their opinions were silently propagated in Rome, Milan, and the king- 
doms beyond the Alps. 28 It was soon discovered that many thousand 
Catholics of every rank, and of either sex, had embraced the Mani- 
chaean heresy; and the flames which consumed twelve canons of Orleans 
was the first act and signal of persecution. The Bulgarians, 2 * a name 
so innocent in its origin, so odious in its application, spread their 
branches over the face of Europe. United in common hatred of idolatry 
and Rome, they were connected by a form of episcopal and presby- 
terian government; their various sects were discriminated by some 
fainter or darker shades of theology; but they generally agreed in 
the two principlesthe contempt of the Old Testament, and the denial 
of the body of Christ either on the cross or in the eucharisL A eon*

cussed by Muratori (Antiquitat Italiae medii JEvi, torn, v, dissert be. p. 81-

fession of simple worship and blameless manners is extorted from their 
enemies; and so high was their standard of perfection, that the increas- 
ing congregations were divided into two classes of disciples, of those 
who practised and of those who aspired. It was in the country of the 
Albigeois, 30 in the southern provinces of France, that the Paulicians 
were most deeply implanted; and the same vicissitudes of martyrdom 
and revenge which had been displayed in the neighbourhood of the 
Euphrates were repeated in the thirteenth century on the banks of the 
Rh6ne. The laws of the Eastern emperors were revived by Frederic 
the Second. The insurgents of Tephrice were represented by the bar- 
ons and cities of Languedoc: Pope Innocent III. surpassed the sangui- 
nary fame of Theodora. It was in cruelty alone that her soldiers could 
equal the heroes of the Crusades, and the cruelty of her priests was far 
excelled by the founders of the Inquisition 81 an office more adapted 
to confirm than to refute the belief of an evil principle. The visible 
assemblies of the Paulicians, or Albigeois, were extirpated by fire and 
sword; and the bleeding remnant escaped by flight, concealment, or 
Catholic conformity. But the invincible spirit which they had kindled 
still lived and breathed in the Western world. In the state, in the 
church, and even in the cloister, a latent succession was preserved of 
the disciples of St. Paul, who protested against the tyranny of Rome, 
embraced the Bible as the rule of faith, and purified their creed from 
all the visions of the Gnostic theology. The struggles of Wickliff in 
England, of Huss in Bohemia, were premature and ineffectual; but the 
names of Zuinglius, Luther, and Calvin are pronounced with gratitude 
as the deliverers of nations. 

A philosopher, who calculates the degree of their merit and the value 
of their reformation, will prudently ask from what articles of faith, 
above or against our reason, they have enfranchised the Christians; for 
such enfranchisement is doubtless a benefit so far as it may be com- 
patible with truth and piety. After a fair discussion we shall rather be 
surprised by the timidity than scandalised by the freedom of our first 
reformers. 82 With the Jews, they adopted the belief and defence of all 
the Hebrew Scriptures, with all their prodigies, from the garden of 

** Of the laws, crusade, and persecution against the Albigeois, a just, though 
general, idea is expressed by Mosheim (p. 477-481). The detail may be found 
in the ecclesiastical historians, ancient and modern, Catholics and Protestants ; 
and among these Fleury is the most impartial and moderate. 

**The Acts (Liber Sententiarum) of the Inquisition of Toulouse (A.D. 
1307-1323) have been published by Limborch (Amstelodami, 1692), with 
a previous History of the Inquisition in general. They deserved a more 
learned and critical editor. As we must not calumniate even Satan, or the 
Holy Office, I will observe that, of a list of criminals which fills nineteen 
folio pages,' only fifteen men and four women were delivered to the secular 
arm. 

81 The opinions and proceedings of the reformers are exposed in the second 
part of the general history of Mosheim; but the balance, which he has held 
with so clear an eye and so steady a hand, .begins to incline in favour of his 
Lutheran brethren.

Eden to the visions of the prophet Daniel; and they were bound, like 
the Catholics, to justify against the Jews the abolition of a divine law.. 
In the great mysteries of the Trinity and Incarnation the reformers 
were severely orthodox: they freely adopted the theology of the four 
or the six first councils; and with the Athanasian creed they pronounced 
the eternal damnation of all who did not believe the Catholic faith. 
Transubstantiation, the invisible change of the bread and wine into 
the body and blood of Christ, is a tenet that may defy the power of 
argument and pleasantry; but instead of consulting the evidence of their 
senses, of their sight, their feeling, and their taste, the first Protestants 
were entangled in their own scruples, and awed by the words of Jesus in 
the institution of the sacrament. Luther maintained a corporeal, and 
Calvin^ a real, presence of Christ in the eucharist; and the opinion of 
Zuinglius, that it is no more than a spiritual communion, a simple 
memorial, has slowly prevailed in the reformed churches. 35 But the 
loss of one mystery was amply compensated by the stupendous doc- 
trines of original sin, redemption, faith, grace, and predestination, 
which have been strained from the epistles of St. Paul. These subtle 
questions had most assuredly been prepared by the fathers and school- 
men; but the final improvement and popular use may be attributed to 
the first reformers, who enforced them as the absolute and essential 
terms of salvation. Hitherto the weight of supernatural belief inclines 
against the Protestants; and many a sober Christian would rather admit 
that a wafer is God than that God is a cruel and capricious tyrant. 

Yet the services of Luther and his rivals are solid and important; and 
the philosopher must own his obligations to these fearless enthusiasts. 84 
I. By their hands the lofty fabric of superstition, from the abuse of 
indulgences to the intercession of the Virgin, has been levelled with 
the ground. Myriads of both sexes of the monastic profession were 
restored to the liberty and labours of social life. A hierarchy of saints 
and angels, of imperfect and subordinate deities, were stripped of their 
temporal power, and reduced to the enjoyment of celestial happiness: 
their images and relics were banished from the church; and the credu- 
lity of the people was no longer nourished with the daily repetition of 
miracles and visions. The imitation of paganism was supplied by $, 
pure and spiritual worship of prayer and thanksgiving, the most worthy 
of man, the least unworthy of the Deity. It only remains to observe 
whether such sublime simplicity be consistent with popular devotion; 
whether the vulgar, in the absence of all visible objects, will not be 
inflamed by enthusiasm or insensibly subside in languor and indiffer- 

M Under Edward VI. our reformation was more bold and perfect: but in 
the fundamental articles of the church of England, a strong and explicit 
declaration against the real presence was obliterated in the original copy, 
to please the people, or the Lutherans, or Queen Elizabeth (Burners History 
of the Reformation, vol. ii. p. 82, 128, 302).

Whiston to Halley the philosopher, "you would now be kneeling before an 
imasre of St Winifred."

ertee. II* Ther chain of authority was broken, which restrains the bigot 
from thinking as he pleases, and the slave from speaking as he thinks: 
thfc" popes, fathers, and councils were no longer the supreme and infal- 
lible judges of the world; and each Christian was taught to acknowledge 
no law but the Scriptures, no interpreter but his own conscience. This 
freedom, however, was the consequence rather than the design of the 
Reformation. The patriot reformers were ambitious of succeeding 
the tyrants whom they had dethroned. They imposed with equal 
rigour their creeds and confessions; they asserted the right of the mag- 
istrate ttffmnish heretics with death. The pious or personal animosity 
of Calvin proscribed in Servetus 88 the guilt of his own rebellion; 86 and 
the flam^ of Smithfield, in which he was afterwards consumed, had 
been kindled for the Anabaptists by the zeal of Cranmer. 37 The nature 
ol the tiger was the same, but he was gradually deprived of his teeth 
and fangs. A spiritual and temporal kingdom was possessed by the 
Roinatf pontiff: the Protestant doctors were subjects of a humble rank, 
without revenue or jurisdiction. His decrees were consecrated by the 
antiquity of the Catholic church; their arguments and disputes were 
submitted to the people; and their appeal to private judgment was 
accepted,- beyond their wishes, by curiosity and enthusiasm. Since the 
days 1 6f Ltiihei? and Calvin a secret reformation has been silently work-

pretence of danger to the church or state. In his passage through Geneva

made proselytes. 3. A Catholic inquisitor yields the same obedience which 
he requires, but Calvin violated the golden rule of doing as he would 
be done by; a rule which I read in a moral treatise of Isocrates (in Nicocle,

Holland 40 and England 41 introduced the practice of toleration; aad 
the narrow allowance of the kws has been enlarged by the prudence 
and humanity of the times. In the exercise the mind has understood 
the limits of its powers, and the words and shadows that might amuse 
the child -can no longer satisfy his manly reason. The volumes of con- 
troversy are overspread with cobwebs: the doctrine of a Protestant 
church is far removed from the knowledge or belief of its private mem- 
bers; and the forms of orthodoxy, the articles of faith, are subscribed 
with a sigh, or a smile, by the modem clergy. Yet the friends of 
Christianity are alarmed at the boundless impulse of inquiry and scep- 
ticism. The predictions of the Catholics are accomplished: the web of 
mystery is unravelled by the Armenians, Arians, and Sodnians, whose 
numbers must not be computed from their separate congregations; and 
the pillars of Revelation are shaken by those men who preserve the 
name without the substance of religion, who indulge the licence with' 
out the temper of philosophy.' 12

UNDER the reign of Constantine, the grandson of Heradius, the ancient 
barrier of the Danube, so often violated and so often restored, was 
irretrievably swept away by a new deluge of barbarians. Their 
progress was favoured by the caliphs, their unknown and accidental 
auxiliaries: the Roman legions were occupied in Asia; and after the 
loss of Syria, Egypt, and Africa, the Caesars were twice reduced to the 
danger and disgrace of defending their capital against the Saracens.

the Arabians press themselves on our curiosity: the first overthrow of 
the church and empire of the Greeks may be imputed to their arms; 
and the disciples of Mohammed still hold the civil and religious sceptre 
of the Oriental world. But the same labour would be unworthily be- 
stowed on the swarms of savages who, between the seventh and the 
twelfth century, descended from the plans of Scythia, in transient 
inroad or perpetual emigration. 1 Their names are uncouth, their ori- 
gins doubtful, their actions obscure, their superstition was blind, their 
valour brutal, and the uniformity of their public and private lives was 
neither softened by innocence nor refined by policy.^ The majesty of 
the Byzantine throne repelled and survived their disorderly attacks; 
the greater part of these barbarians has disappeared without leaving 
any memorial of their existence, and the despicable remnant continues, 
and may long continue, to groan under the dominion of a foreign 
tyrant. From the antiquities of, I. Bulgarians, IL Hungarians, and, 
HE. Russians, I shall content myself with selecting such facts as yet 
deserve to be remembered. The conquests of the, IV. NORMANS, and 
the monarchy of the, V. TURKS, will naturally terminate in the memo- 
rable Crusades to the Holy Land and the double fall of the city and 
empire of Constantine. 

I. In his march to Italy, Theodoric, 2 the Ostrogoth, had trampled 
on the arms of the Bulgarians, After this defeat the natne and the 
nation are lost during a century and a half; and it may be suspected 
that the same or a similar appellation was revived by strange colonies 
from the Borysthenes, the Tanais, or the Volga. A king of the ancient 
Bulgaria 3 bequeathed to his five sons a last lesson of moderation and 
concord. It was received as youth has ever received the counsels of 
age and experience: the five princes buried their father; divided his 
subjects and cattle; forgot his advice; separated from each other; and 
wandered in quest of fortune, till we find the most adventurous in the 
heart of Italy, under the protection of the exarch of Ravenna.* But 

1 All the passages of the Byzantine history which relate to the barbarians 
are compiled, methodised, and transcribed, in a Latin version, by the laborious

the stream of emigration was directed or impelled towards the capital. 
The modern Bulgaria, along the southern banks of the Danube, was 
stamped with the name and image which it has retained to the present 
hour: the new conquerors successively acquired, by war or treaty, the 
Roman provinces of Dardania, Thessaly, and the two Epirus'; 5 the 
ecclesiastical supremacy was translated from the native city of Jus- 
tinian; and, in their prosperous age, the obscure town of Lychnidus, or 
Acbrida, was honoured with the throne of a king and a patriarch, 6 The 
unquestionable evidence of language attests the descent of the Bulgari- 
ans from the original stock of the Sclavonian, or more properly Sla- 
vonian, race; 7 and the kindred bands of Servians, Bosnians, Rascians, 

"These provinces of the Greek idiom and empire are assigned to the Bul- 
garian kingdom in the dispute of ecclesiastical jurisdiction between the patri- 
archs of Rome and Constantinople (Baronius, Annal. Eccles. AJ&gt;. 869, No. 75). 

* The situation and royalty of Lychnidus, or Achrida, are clearly expressed 
in Cedrenus (p. 713 [torn. ii. p. 468, ed. Bonn]). The removal of an arch- 
bishop or patriarch from Justinianea prima to Lychnidus, and at length, to 
Ternovo, has produced some perplexity in the ideas or language of the Greeks 
(Nicephorus Gregoras, 1. ii. c. 2, p. 14, 15 [torn. i. p. 27, ed. Bonn] ; Thomassin, 
Discipline de TEglise, torn. i. 1. i. c. 19, 23) ; and a Frenchman (D'Anville) 
is more accurately skilled in the geography of their own country (Hist, de 
r Academic des Inscriptions, torn. xxxi.). 

7 Chalcocondyles, a competent judge, affirms the identity of the language 
of the Dalmatians, Bosnians, Servians, Bulgarians, Poles (de Rebus Turcicis, 
I. x. p. 283 [ed. Par.; p. 530, ed. Bonn]), and elsewhere of the Bohemians 
(1. ii. p. 38 [p. 73, ed. Bonn]). The same author has marked the separate 
idiom of tiie Hungarians. 

[The statement by Gibbon that the Bulgarians are Slavonic in origin is 
both incorrect and contradicts his own statement in chapter xliL, where he 
had correctly identified the Bulgarians and the Huns, as already proved 
by Zeuss, who has shown that they consequently belonged to the Turkish 
and not to the Slavonic race. In the sixth century several tribes -of the 
Bulgarians were subject to the Avars, but in 634, Cubrat, a friend of the 
Romans, threw off the yoke of the Avars. A few years later (c. 670) the 
Bulgarians appear as enemies of the Romans, and to the great terror of 
Constantinople they crossed the Danube and, uniting themselves with the 
Slavonic inhabitants, founded the Bulgarian kingdom between the Danube 
and the Hsemus. The name of the conquerors still remains, but their lan- 
guage has long given way to that of the Slavonians. A portion of the Bul- 
garians remained in their earlier abodes to the eastward; and Theophanes, 
in a passage quoted by Gibbon, correctly places Old Bulgaria on the Etel 
or Atal or the Volga, the former being the name of this river in the Tartar 
language, while the latter probably comes from the Bulgarians. The Bul- 
garian kingdom on. the Volga was called by the Russian historians "Great 
or Black Bulgaria," and the Danubian Bulgaria often took the name * Little 
or White Bulgaria." Great Bulgaria extended from the confluence of the 
Kama and the Volga to the shores of the Euxine and the Caspian*. The ruins 
of its capital city, Bolgari, have been discovered in the province of Kasan 
on the banks of the Danube. In the tenth century the Bulgarians were Mo- 
hammedans, and attempted to convert the Czar Vladimir of Russia with his 
people to the religion of the prophet The Bulgarians were free 
visited commercially by the Arabs, and they continued a powerful 
until they were overwhelmed by the invasion of the Mongols. Cf.

Croatians, Wallacbians, 8 etc., followed either the standard or the ex- 
ample of the leading tribe. From the Enxme to the Adriatic, in the 
state of captives, or subjects, or allies, or enemies, of the Greek empire, 
they overspread the land; and the national appellation of the SLAVES 
has been degraded by chance or malice from the signification of glory 
to that of servitude. 10 Among these colonies, the Chrofaatians, 11 or 
Croats, who now attend the motions of an Austrian army, are the 
descendants of a mighty people, the conquerors and sovereigns of Dal- 
matia. The maritime cities, and of these the infant republic of Ragusa, 
implored the aid and instructions of the Byzantine court: they were 
advised by the magnanimous Basil to reserve a small acknowledgment 
of their fidelity to the Roman empire, and to appease, by an annual 
tribute, the wrath of these irresistible barbarians. The kingdom of 
Croatia was shared by eleven Zoupans, or feudatory lords; and their 
united forces were numbered at sixty thousand horse and one hundred 
thousand foot A long sea-coast, indented with capacious harbours, 
covered with a string of islands, and almost in sight of the Italian 
shores, disposed both the natives and strangers to the practice of navi- 
gation. Tlie boats or brigantines of the Croats were constructed after 
the fashion of the old Libumians: one hundred and eighty vessels may 
excite the idea of a respectable navy; but our seamen will smile at the 
allowance of ten, or twenty, or forty men, for each of these ships of 
war. They were gradually converted to the more honourable service of 
commerce; yet the Sdavonian pirates were still frequent and danger- 
ous; and it was not before the dose of the tenth century that the free-

Vindobonae, 1745, in four parts, or two volumes in folio. His collections and 
researches are useful to elucidate the antiquities of Bohemia and the adjacent 
countries; but his plan is narrow, his style barbarous, his criticism shallow, 
and the Aulic counsellor is not free from the prejudices of a Bohemian. 

[It is a mistake for Gibbon to assert that the Wallachians were of Sla- 
vonic origin, nor were they akin to the Servians, Bosnians, and other Slavonic 
tribes. They are a Romance people, of Illyrian origin, speaking a language 
derived from the Latin, lifce French, Italian, Spanish. They still call them-

speech, and whidi_ forms the termination of the most illustrious names (de 
Omnibus Scbvtcis, pars i. p. 40, pars iv. p. xoi, 102). 

This conversion of a national into an appellative name appears to have 
arisen in the eighth century, in the Oriental France, where the princes and 
Oistops were nch m Sdavonian captives, not of the Bohemian (exclaims 
Jordan), but of Sorabian race. From thence the word was extended to gen- 
eral nse, to Hie modern languages, and even to the styk of the last Byzan-

dom and sovereignty of the Gulf were effectually vindicated by the 
Venetian republic. 12 The ancestors of these Dalmatian kings were 
equally removed from the use and abuse of navigation: ttey dwelt in 
the White Croatia, in the inland regions of Silesia and Little Poland, 
thirty days' journey, according to the Greek computation, from the 
sea of darkness. 

The glory of the Bulgarians 13 was confined to a narrow scope both 
of time and place. In the ninth and tenth centuries they reigned to the 
south of the Danube, but the more powerful nations that had followed 
their emigration repelled all return to the north and all progress to the 
west. Yet in the obscure catalogue of their exploits they might boast 
an honour which had hitherto been appropriated to the Goths, that of 
slaying in battle one of the successors of Augustus and Constantine. 
The emperor Nicephorus had lost his fame in the Arabian, he lost his 
life in the Sdavonian, war. In the first operations he advanced witfc 
boldness and success into the centre of Bulgaria, and burnt the royal 
court, which was probably no more than an edifice and village of tim- 
ber. But while he searched the spoil and refused all offers of treaty, 
his enemies collected their spirits and their forces; the passes of re- 
treat were insuperably barred, and the trembling Nicephorus was heard 
to exclaim, " Alas, alas! unless we could assume the wings of birds, we 
cannot hope to escape." Two days he waited his fate in the inactivity 
of despair, but, on the morning of the third, the Bulgarians surprised 
the camp, and the Roman prince, with the great officers of the empire, 
were slaughtered in their tents. The body of Valens had been saved 
from insult, but the head of Nicephorus was exposed on a spear, and 
his skull, enchased with gold, was often replenished in the feasts of 
victory. The Greeks bewailed the dishonour of the throne, but they 
acknowledged the just punishment of avarice and cruelty. This savage 
cup was deeply tinctured with the manners of the Scythian wilderness, 
but they were softened before the end of the same century by a peace- 
ful intercourse with the Greeks, the possession of a cultivated region, 
and the introduction of the Christian worship. The nobles of Bulgaria 
were educated in the schools and palace of Constantinople, and Sin*- 
eon, 14 a youth of the royal line, was instructed in the rhetoric of Demos- 
thenes and the logic of Aristotle. He relinquished the profession of a

forty years Bulgaria assumed a rank among the civilised powers of 
the earth. The Greeks, whom he repeatedly attacked, derived a faint 
consolation from indulging themselves in the reproaches of perfidy and 
sacrilege. They purchased the aid of the pagan Turks, but Simeon, 
in a second battle, redeemed the loss of the first, at a time when it was 
esteemed a victory to elude the arms of that formidable nation. The 
Servians were overthrown, made captive, and dispersed; and those 
who visited the country before their restoration could discover no more 
than fifty vagrants, without women or children, who extorted a pre- 
carious subsistence from the chase. On classic ground, on the banks 
of the Achelous, the Greeks were defeated: their horn was broken by 
the strength of the barbaric Hercules. 13 He formed the siege of Con- 
stantinople, and, in a personal conference with the emperor, Simeon im- 
posed the conditions of peace. They met with the most jealous 
precautions: the royal galley was drawn close to an. artificial and well- 
fortified platform, and the majesty of the purple was emulated by the 
pomp of the Bulgarian. " Are you a Christian? " said the humble Ro- 
manus; " It is your duty to abstain from the blood of your fellow- 
Christians. Has the thirst of riches seduced you from the blessings 
of peace? Sheathe your sword, open your hand, and I will satiate the 
utmost measure of your desires." The reconciliation was sealed by a 
domestic alliance; the freedom of trade was granted or restored; the 
first honours of the court were secured to the friends of Bulgaria, above 
the ambassadors of enemies or strangers; 16 and her princes were digni- 
fied with the high and invidious title of Basileus, or emperor. But this 
friendship was soon disturbed: after the death of Simeon the nations 
were again in arms, his feeble successors were divided and extinguished, 
and, in the beginning of the eleventh century, the second Basil, who

was born in the purple, deserved the appellation of conqueror of the 
Bulgarians. His avarice was in some measure gratified by a treasure 
of four hundred thousand pounds sterling (ten thousand pounds weight 
of gold), which he found in the palace of Lychnidus. His cruelty 
inflicted a cool and exquisite vengeance on fifteen thousand captives 
who had been guilty of the defence of their country. They were de- 
prived of sight, but to one of each hundred a single eye was left, that 
he might conduct his blind century to the presence of their king. Their 
king is said to have expired of grief and horror; the nation was awed 
by this terrible example; the Bulgarians were swept away from their 
settlements, and circumscribed within a narrow province; the surviv- 
ing chiefs beqtfeathed to their children the advice of patience and the 
duty of revenge. 

II. When the black swarm of Hungarians first hung over Europe^ 
about nine hundred years after the Christian era, they were mistakes 
by fear and superstition for the Gog and Magog of the Scriptures, the 
signs and forerunners of the end of the world. 17 Since the introduction 
of letters they have explored their own antiquities with a strong and 
laudable impulse of patriotic curiosity. 18 Their rational criticism can 
no longer be amused with a vain pedigree of Attila and the Huns: but 
they complain that their primitive records have perished in the Tartar 
war; that the truth or fiction of their rustic songs is long since for- 
gotten; and that the fragments of a rude chronicle 1 * .must be pain- 
fully reconciled with the contemporary though foreign intelligence of 
the Imperial geographer. 20 Magyar is the national and oriental denom- 
ination of the Hungarians; but, among the tribes of Scythia, they are 
distinguished by the Greeks under the proper and peculiar name of 

W A bishop of Wurtzburg submitted this opinion to a reverend abbot; 
but he more gravely decided that Gog and Magog were the spiritual perse- 
cutors of the church ; since Gog signifies the roof, the pride of the heresiarchs, 
and Magog what comes from the roof, the propagation of their sects. Yet 
these men once commanded the respect of mankind (Fleury, Hist Eccles. 
torn. xi. p. 594, etc.). 

18 The two national authors from whom I have derived the most assistance 
are George Pray (Dissertationes ad Annales veterum Hungaroruxa, eta, 
Vindobonae, 1775, in folio) and Stephen Katona (Hist. Critica Ducum et 
Regum Hungariae stirpis Arpadianae, Paestini, 1778-1781, 5 vols. in octavo) x . 
The first embraces a large and often conjectural space; the latter, by his 
learning, judgment, and perspicuity, deserves the name of a critical historian, 

*The author of this Chronicle is styled the notary of king Bela. Katona 
has assigned him to the twelfth century, and defends his character against 
the hypercriticism of Pray. This rude annalist must have transcribed some 
historical records, since he could affirm with dignity, rejectis falsis fabulis 
rusticorum, et garrulo cantu joculatorum. In the fifteenth century these 
fables were collected by Thurotzius, and embellished by the Italian Bonfinius. 
See the Preliminary Discourse in the Hist. Critica Ducum, p. 7-33. 

* See Constantino de Administrando Imperio, c. 3, 4, 13, 38-42. Katona has 
nicely fixed the composition of this work to the years 949, 950, 951 (p. 4-7). 
The critical historian (p. 34-107) endeavours to prove the existence, and to 
relate the actions, of a first duke Almus, the father of Arpad, who is tacitly 
rejected by Constantine.

Turks, as the descendants of that mighty people who had conquered and 
reigned from China to the Volga. The Pannonian colony preserved a 
correspondence of trade and amity with the eastern Turks on the con- 
fines of Persia; and after a separation of three hundred and fifty years 
the missionaries of the king of Hungary discovered and visited their 
indent country near the banks of the Volga. They were hospitably 
entertained by a people of pagans and savages who still bore the name 
of Hungarians; conversed in their native tongue, recollected a tradi- 
tion of their long-lost brethren, and listened with amazement to the 
marvellous tale of their new kingdom and religion. The zeal of con- 
version was animated by the interest of consanguinity, and one of the 
greatest of their princes had formed the generous, though fruitless, 
design of replenishing the solitude of Pannonia by this domestic colony 
from the heart of Tartaiy. 21 From this primitive country they were 
driven to the West by the tide of war and emigration, by the weight 
of the mare distant tribes, who at the same time were fugitives and 
soaqtieroft. Reason or fortune directed their course towards the 
frontiers of the Roraaa empire; they halted in the usual stations along 
the banks of the great rivers; and in the territories of Moscow, Kiow, 
tod Moldavia, some vestiges hav been discovered of tbeir temporary 
residence. In this long and various peregrination they could not always 
eacftpe tie dominion of tte strofcgfeir, and the purity of their blood was

allies marched in seven equal and artificial divisions: each division was 
formed of thirty thousand eight hundred and fifty-seven warriors, and 
the proportion of women, children, and servants supposes and requires 
at least a million of emigrants. Their public counsels were directed 
by seven wyvods, or hereditary chiefs; but the experience of discord 
and weakness recommended the more simple and vigorous adminis- 
tratSoa of a single person. The sceptre, which had been declined by 
the modest lebedias, was granted to the birth or merit of Almus and 
his SOD Arpad, and the authority of the supreme khan of the Chazals 
confirmed th* engagement of the prince and people; of the people to 
obey his commands, of the priaoe to consult their happiness and glofy. 
With this narrative we might be reasonably content, if the penette-

savage race, which formerly occupied the northern regions of Asia sad

western confines of China; 28 their migration to the banks of the Irtish 
is attested by Tartar evidence; 2 * a similar name and language are de- 
tected in the southern parts ot Siberia; 25 and the remains of the Fennic 
tribes are widely, though thinly, scattered from the sources of the Oby 
to the shores of Lapland. 20 The consanguinity of the Hungarians and 
Laplanders would display the powerful energy of climate on the chil- 
dren of a common parent; the lively contrast between the bold adveor 
turers who are intoxicated with the wines of the Danube, and the 
wretched fugitives who are immersed beneath the snows of the polar 
cirde. Arms and freedom have ever been the ruling, though too 0fte$ 
the unsuccessful, passion of the Hungarians, who are endowed by

the Hungarian with the Fennic dialects. The affinity is indeed striking, but 
the lists are short ; the words are purposely chosen ; and I read in the learned 
Bayer (Comment. Academ. PetropoL torn. x. p. 374) that, although the Hun- 
garian has adopted many Fennic words (innumeras voces), Jt essentially 
differs toto genio et natura. 

[The question which Gibbon discusses is whether Are the Hungarians 
Turkish or Finnic? Their language manifests the elements of both tongues. 
Those who advocate a Turkish origin explain the presence of the Finnic ele- 
ment in the vocabulary by .a prolonged residence in the vicinity of the Vogul$ 
and the Ostiaks; while those who support the Finnic hypothesis explain the 
Turkish element by local borrowing by the way during their migrations. It 
is unquestionable that Hungarian has many points of affinity with Vogal, 
Ostiak, and kindred tongues. The Magyar at one time lived in jugria near 
the Irtish, where they were the neighbours of the Voguls. In the eighth cen- 
tury they migrated southward, and early in the ninth were living with the 
empire of the Chazars, where they absorbed a tribe named the Kabars, whp 
became part of the Hungarians. These Kabars (says Constantine Porphyr&lt;y- 
genitus) taught the Hungarians the Chazaric tongue. Hence .die upholders 
of a Finnic origin of the Turks can explain the Turkish element kt Hungary 
by a known cause, the coalition with the Kabars. 

The original Magyars seem to have been, like the Kabars, a Turkish tribe 
which coalesced with the Finnic Ugrians or Hungarians. Ugria is called 
Great Hungary by the Francescaa monk Piano Carpini, who travelled in 
1426 to the court of the Great Khan. O. S.]

ers; and the Arctic tribes, alone among the sons of men, are ignorant 
of war and unconscious of human blood: a happy ignorance, if reason 
and virtue were the guardians of their peacel 2S 

It is the observation of the Imperial author of the Tactics, 2 * that 
all the Scythian hordes resembled each other in their pastoral and mili- 
tary life, that they all practised the same means of subsistence, and 
employed the same instruments of destruction. But he adds that the 
two nations of Bulgarians and Hungarians were superior to their breth- 
ren, and similar to each other, in the improvements, however rude, of 
their discipline and government: their visible likeness determines Leo 
to confound his friends and enemies in one common description; and 
the picture may be heightened by some strokes from their contempo- 
raries of the tenth century. Except the merit and fame of military 
prowess, all that is valued by mankind appeared vile and contemptible 
to these barbarians, whose native fierceness was stimulated by the con- 
sciousness of numbers and freedom. The tents of the Hungarians were 
of leather, their garments of fur; they shaved their hair and scarified 
their faces: in speech they were slow, in action prompt, in treaty per- 
fidious; and they shared the common reproach of barbarians, too ig- 
Dorant to conceive the importance of truth, too proud to deny or 
palliate the breach of their most solemn engagements. Their simplicity 
has been praised; yet they abstained only from the luxury they had 
never known: whatever they saw they coveted; their desires were in- 
satiate, and their sole industry was the hand of violence and rapine. 
By the definition of a pastoral nation I have recalled a long descrip- 
tion of the economy, the warfare, and the government that prevail in 
that state of society; I may add, that to fishing as well as to the chase 
die Hungarians were indebted for a part of their subsistence; and 
since they seldom cultivated the ground, they must, at least in their 
new settlements, have sometimes practised a slight and unskilful hus- 
bandry. In their emigrations, perhaps in their expeditions, the host 
was accompanied by thousands of sheep and oxen, which increased the

THE ROMAN EMPIRE 323 

cloud of formidable dust, and afforded a constant and wholesome sup- 
ply of milk and animal food. A plentiful command of forage was the 
first care of the general; and if the flocks and herds were secure of 
their pastures, the hardy warrior was alike insensible of danger and 
fatigue. The confusion of men and cattle that overspread the country 
exposed their camp to a nocturnal surprise, had not a still wider circuit 
been occupied by their light cavalry, perpetually in motion to discover 
and delay the approach of the enemy. After some experience of the 
Roman tactics, they adopted the use of the sword and spear, the hel- 
met of the soldier, and the iron breastplate of his steed: but their 
native and deadly weapon was the Tartar bow: from the earliest 
infancy their children and servants were exercised in the double science 
of archery and horsemanship; their arm was strong; their aim was 
sure; and in the most rapid career they were taught to throw them- 
selves backwards, and to shoot a volley of arrows into the air. In 
open combat, in secret ambush, in flight, or pursuit, they were equally 
formidable: an appearance of order was maintained in the foremost 
ranks, but their charge was driven forwards by the impatient pressure 
of succeeding crowds. They pursued, headlong and rash, with loosened 
reins and horrific outcries; but, if they fled, with real or dissembled 
fear, the ardour of a pursuing foe was checked and chastised by the 
same habits of irregular speed and sudden evolution. In the abuse of 
victory they astonished Europe, yet smarting from the wounds of the 
Saracen and the Dane: mercy they rarely asked, and more rarely be- 
stowed: both sexes were accused as equally inaccessible to pity; and 
their appetite for raw flesh might countenance the popular tale that 
they drank the blood and feasted on the hearts of the slain. Yet the 
Hungarians were not devoid of those principles of justice and humanity 
which nature has implanted in every bosom. The licence of public and 
private injuries was restrained by laws and punishments; and in the 
security of an open camp, theft is the most tempting and most danger- 
ous offence. Among the barbarians there were many whose spon- 
taneous virtue supplied their laws and corrected their manners, who 
performed the duties, and sympathised with the affections, of social 
life. 

After a long pilgrimage of flight or victory, the Turkish hordes ap- 
proached the common limits of the French and Byzantine empires. 
Their first conquests and final settlements extended on either side of 
the Danube above Vienna, below Belgrade, and beyond the measure of 
the Roman province, or the modern kingdom of Hungary. 80 That 
ample and fertile land was loosely occupied by the Moravians, a Sclav- 
onian name and tribe, which were driven by the invaders into the com- 
pass of a narrow province. Charlemagne had stretched a vague and 
nominal empire as far as the edge of Transylvania; but, after the 
failure of his legitimate line, the dukes of Moravia forgot their obedi-

326 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

cnce and tribute to the monarchs of Oriental France. The bastard 
Arnulph was provoked to invite the arms of the Turks: they rushed 
through the real or figurative wall which his indiscretion had thrown 
open; and the king of Germany has been justly reproached as a 
traitor to the civil and ecclesiastical society of the Christians. Dur- 
ing the life of Arnulph the Hungarians were checked by gratitude or 
fear; but in the infancy of his son Lewis they discovered and invaded 
Bavaria; and such was their Scythian speed, that in a single day a 
circuit of fifty miles was stripped and consumed. In the battle of 
Augsburg the Christians maintained their advantage till the seventh 
hour of the day: they were deceived and vanquished by the flying 
stratagems of the Turkish cavalry. The conflagration spread over the 
provinces of Bavaria, Swabia, and Franconia; and the Hungarians 31 
promoted the reign of anarchy by forcing the stoutest barons to disci- 
pline their vassals and fortify their castles. 

The origin of walled towns is ascribed to their calamitous period; nor 
could any distance be secure against an enemy, who, almost at the 
same instant, laid in ashes the Helvetian monastery of St. Gall, and 
" the city of Bremen on the shores of the northern ocean. Above thirty 
years the Germanic empire, or kingdom, was subject to the ignominy 
of tribute; and resistance was disarmed by the menace, the serious and 
effectual menace, of dragging the women and children into captivity, 
and of slaughtering the males above the age of ten years. I have 
neither power nor inclination to follow the Hungarians beyond the 
Rhine; but I must observe with surprise that the southern provinces 
of France were blasted by the tempest, and that Spain, behind her 
Pyrenees, was astonished at the approach of these formidable stran- 
gers." The vicinity of Italy had tempted their early inroads; but from 
their camp on the Brenta they beheld with some terror the apparent 
strength and populousness of the new-discovered country. They re- 
quested leave to retire; their request was proudly rejected by the Italian 
king; and the lives of twenty thousand Christians paid the forfeit of 
his obstinacy and rashness. Among the cities of the West the royal 
Pavia was conspicuous in fame and splendour; and the pre-eminence 
of Rome itself was only derived from the relics of the apostles. The 
Hungarians appeared; Pavia was in flames; forty-three churches were 
consumed; and, after the massacre of the people, they spared about two 
hundred wretches who had gathered some bushels of gold and silver 
(a vague exaggeration) from the smoking ruins of their country. In

these annual excursions from the Alps to the neighbourhood of Rome 
and Capua, the churches that yet escaped resounded with a fearful 
iitany: " Oh! save and deliver us from the arrows of the Hungarians! " 
But the saints were deaf or inexorable; and the torrent rolled forwards, 
till it was stopped by the extreme land of Calabria. 33 A composition 
was offered and accepted for the head of each Italian subject; and ten 
bushels of silver were poured forth in the Turkish camp. But false- 
hood is the natural antagonist of violence; and the robbers were de- 
frauded both in the numbers of the assessment and the standard of the 
metal. On the side of the East the Hungarians were opposed in doubt- 
ful conflict by the equal arms of the Bulgarians, whose faith forbade 
an alliance with the pagans, and whose situation formed the barrier 
of the Byzantine empire. The barrier was overturned; the emperor 
of Constantinople beheld the waving banners of the Turks; and one of 
their boldest warriors presumed to strike a battle-axe into the golden 
gate. The arts and treasures of the Greeks diverted the assault; but 
the Hungarians might boast in their retreat that they had imposed a 
tribute on the spirit of Bulgaria and the majesty of the Csesars. 34 The 
remote and rapid operations of the same campaign appear to magnify 
the power and numbers of the Turks; but their courage is most deserv- 
ing of praise, since a light troop of three or four hundred horses would 
often attempt and execute the most daring inroads to the gates of 
Thessalonica and Constantinople. At this disastrous era of the ninth 
and tenth centuries, Europe was afflicted by a triple scourge from the 
North, the East, and the South: the Norman, the Hungarian, and the 
Saracen sometimes trod the same ground of desolation; and these sav- 
age foes might have been compared by Homer to the two lions growl- 
ing over the carcase of a mangled stag. 35

328 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

The deliverance of Germany and Christendom was achieved by the 
Saxon princes, Henry the Fowler and Otho the Great, who, in two 
memorable battles, forever broke the power of the Hungarians. 36 The 
valiant Henry was roused from a bed of sickness by the invasion of 
his country, but h:s mind was vigorous and his prudence successful. 
" My companions," said he, on the morning of the combat, " maintain 
your ranks, receive on your bucklers the first arrows of the pagans, and 
prevent their second discharge by the equal and rapid career of your 
lances/" They obeyed and conquered; and the historical picture of the 
castles of Merseburgh expressed the features, or at least the character, 
af Henry, who, in an age of ignorance, intrusted to the finer arts the 
perpetuity of his name." 7 At the end of twenty years the children of 
the Turks who had fallen by his sword invaded the empire of his son, 
and their force is defined, in the lowest estimate, at one hundred thou- 
sand horse. They were invited by domestic faction; the gates of Ger- 
many were treacherously unlocked, and they spread, far beyond the 
Rhine and the Meuse, into the heart of Flanders. But the vigour and 
prudence of Otho dispelled the conspiracy; the princes -were made sen- 
sible that, unless they were true to each other, their religion and country 
were irrecoverably lost, and the national powers were reviewed in the 
plains of Augsburg. They marched and fought in eight legions, accord- 
ing to the division of provinces and tribes: the first, second, and third 
were composed of Bavarians, the fourth of Franconians, the fifth of 
Saxons under the immediate command of the monarch, the sixth and 
seventh consisted of Swabians, and the eighth legion, of a thousand 
Bohemians, closed the rear of the host. The resources of discipline 
and valour were fortified by the arts of superstition, which, on this 
occasion, inay deserve the epithets of generous and salutary. The 
soldiers were purified with a fast, the camp was blessed with the relics 
of saints and martyrs, and the Christian hero girded on his side the 
sword of Constantine, grasped the invincible spear of Charlemagne, and 
waved the banner of St. Maurice, the praefect of the Thebaean legion. 

* They are amply and criticaHy discussed by Katona (Hist. Ducum, p. 360- 
368, 427-4/0). Liutprand (I. ii. c. 8, 9) is the best evidence for the former, 
and \\ itichind (Annal. Saxon. 1. iii.) of the latter ; but the critical historian 
will not even overlook the horn of a warrior, which is said to be preserved 
at Jaz-berin.

encomium (Liutprand, 1. ii. c. 9). Another palace in Germany had been 
painted with holy subjects by the order of Charlemagne; and Muratori may 
justly affirm, nulla saecula fuere in quibus pictores desiderati fuerint (An- 
tiquitat. Ital. medii ^Evi, torn. ii. dissert xxiv. p. 360, 361). Our domestic 
claims to antiquity of ignorance and original imperfection (Mr. Walpole's 
lively words) are of a much more recent date (Anecdotes of Painting, vol. i. 
p. 2, etc.).

But his firmest confidence was placed in the holy lance, 38 whose point 
was fashioned of the nails of the cross, and which his father had ex- 
torted from the king of Burgundy by the threats of war and the gift of 
a province. The Hungarians were expected in the front; they secretly 
passed the Lech, a river of Bavaria that falls into the Danube, turned 
the rear of the Christian army, plundered the baggage, and disordered 
the legions of Bohemia and Swabia, The battle was restored by the 
Franconians, whose duke, the valiant Conrad, was pierced with an 
arrow as he rested from his fatigues; the Saxons fought under the 
eyes of their king, and his victory surpassed, in merit and importance, 
the triumphs of the last two hundred years. The loss of the Hun- 
garians was still greater in the flight than in the action; they were 
encompassed by the rivers of Bavaria, and their past cruelties excluded 
them from the hope of mercy. Three captive princes were hanged at 
Ratisbon, the multitude of prisoners was slain or mutilated, and the 
fugitives who presumed to appear in the face of their country were 
condemned to everlasting poverty and disgrace. 39 Yet the spirit of the 
nation was humbled, and the most accessible passes of Hungary were 
fortified with a ditch and rampart. Adversity suggested the counsels 
of moderation and peace: the robbers of the West acquiesced in a 
sedentary life; and the next generation was taught, by a discerning 
prince, that far more might be gained by multiplying and exchanging 
the produce of a fruitful soil. The native race, the Turkish or Fennic 
blood, was mingled with new colonies of Scythian or Sclavonian ori-

who joined the Hungarians on their march (Constant, de Admin. Imp. 
c. 39, 40, p. 108, 109 [torn. iii. p. 171, seqq., ecL Bonn]). 2. The Jazyges, 
Moravians, and Siculi, whom they found in the land; the last were perhaps 
a remnant of the Huns of Attila, and were intrusted with the guard of the 
borders. 3. The Russians, who, like the Swiss in France, imparted a general 
name to the royal porters. 4. The Bulgarians, whose chiefs (A.D. 956) were 
invited, cum magna multitudine Hismahetttarum. Had any of these Sclavo- 
nians embraced the Mohammedan religion? 5. The Bisseni and Cumans, a 
mixed multitude of Patzinacites, Uzi, Chazars, etc., who had spread to the 
lower Danube. The last colony of 40,000 Cumans. A.D. 1239, was received 
and converted by the kings of Hungary, who derived from that tribe a new 
regal appellation (Pray, dissert, vi. vii. p. 109-173; Katona, Hist. Ducum, 
P- 95-99, 259-264, 476, 479-483, etc.). 

[The Jazyges, Moravians, and Siculi. The first named must not be 
confounded with the earlier Sarmatian people of this name. They were a 
division of the Cumanians called by the Hungarian Jaszok (from singular 
/*, archers, whence their name Jazyges) : they dwelt on the right bank of 
the Theiss. The Siculi were probably the remnant of the Huns of Attila. 
The Hismahelitae must have been Mohammedans, as Gibbon conjectures. 
They were probably Baschkirs who had settled in Bulgaria. The Bisseni

imported from all the countries of Europe; 41 and after the marriage of 
Geisa with a Bavarian princess, he bestowed honours and estates on the 
nobles of Germany. 42 The son of Geisa was invested with, the regal 
title, and the house of Arpad reigned three hundred years in the king- 
dom of Hungary. But the freeborn barbarians were not dazzled by 
the lustre of the diadem, and the people asserted their indefeasible right 
of choosing, deposing, and punishing the hereditary servant of the 
state. 

Ill, The name of RUSSIANS 4S was first divulged, in the ninth cen- 
tury, by an embassy from Theophilus, emperor of the East, to the 
emperor of the West, Lewis, the son of Charlemagne. The Greeks were 
accompanied by the envoys of the great duke, or chagan, or czar of the 
Russians. In their journey to Constantinople they had traversed many 
hostile nations, and they hoped to escape the dangers of their return 
by requesting the French monarch to transport them by sea to their 
native country. A closer examination detected their origin: they were 
the brethren of the Swedes and Normans, whose name was already 
odious and formidable in France; and it might justly be apprehended 
that these Russian strangers were not the messengers of peace, but the 
emissaries of war. They were detained, while the Greeks were dis- 
missed; and Lewis expected a more satisfactory account, that he might 
obey the laws of hospitality or prudence according to the interest of 
both empires, 44 This Scandinavian origin of the people, or at least 

is the name given by the Hungarian chroniclers to the Turkish tribe of the 
Petcheneges, called Uar^aKtrat by Constantine Porphyrogenitus, and Pec- 
zenjezi by the Slavonians. The Cumani, afterwards called Kiptschahs * were 
the people named Uzi by Constan. Porphyr. They are called Gusses, or Goss 
by Arabian writers. The Uzi or Cumani were also Turks and spoke the 
*ame language as the Petcheneges. At a later period these two peoples were 
found in possession of the whole country to the northward of the Euxine.

the princes, of Russia, may be confirmed and illustrated by the national 
annals * 5 and the general history of the North. The Normans, who 
had so long been concealed by a veil of impenetrable darkness, sud- 
denly burst forth in the spirit of naval and military enterprise. The 
vast, and, as it is said, the populous, regions of Denmark, Sweden, and 
Norway were crowded with independent chieftains and desperate ad- 
venturers, who sighed in the laziness of peace, and smiled in the 
agonies of death. Piracy was the exercise, the trade, the glory, and 
the virtue of the Scandinavian youth. Impatient of a bleak climate 
and narrow limits, they started from the banquet, grasped their arms, 
sounded their horn, ascended the vessels, and explored every coast that 
promised either spoil or settlement. The Baltic was the first scene of 
their naval achievements; they visited the eastern shores, the silent 
residence of Feimic and Sclavonian tribes; and the primitive Russian? 
of the lake Ladoga paid a tribute, the skins of white squirrels, to these 
strangers, whom they saluted with the title of Varangians 4G or Cor- 
sairs. Their superiority in arms, discipline, and renown commanded 
the fear and reverence of the natives. In their wars against the more 
inland savages the Varangians condescended to serve as friends and 
auxiliaries, and gradually, by choice or conquest, obtained the domin- 
ion of a people whom they were qualified to protect. Their tyranny 
was expelled, their valour was again recalled, till at length Ruric, a 
Scandinavian chief, became the father of a dynasty which reigned 
above seven hundred years. His brothers extended his influence; the 
example of service and usurpation was imitated by his companions in 
the southern provinces of Russia; and their establishments, by the 
usual methods of war and assassination, were cemented into the fabric 
of a powerful monarchy. 

As long as the descendants of Ruric were considered as aliens and 
conquerors, they ruled by the sword of the Varangians, distributed 
estates and subjects to their faithful captains, and supplied their num- 
bers with fresh streams of adventurers from the Baltic coast 47 But 
when the Scandinavian chiefs had struck a deep and permanent root 
into the soil, they mingled with the Russians in blood, religion, and 
language, and the first Waladimir had the merit of delivering his coun- 
try from these foreign mercenaries. They had seated him on the 
throne; his riches were insufficient to satisfy their demands; but they 

45 My knowledge of these annals is drawn from M. Leveque, Histoire de 
Russie. Nestor, the first and best of these ancient annalists, was a monk 
of Kiow, who died in the beginning of the twelfth century; but his Chronicle 
was obscure till it was published at Petersburgh, 1767, in 4to; Leveque, Hist, 
de Russie, torn. i. p. xvL; Coxe's Travels, voL ii. p. 184.

47 Yet, as late as the year 1018, Kiow and Russia were still guarded ex 
ftigitivorum servorum robore, confluentium et maxinie Danorum. Bayer, 
who quotes (p. 292) the Chronicle of Ditmar of Merseburg, observes that i* 
was unusual for the Germans to enlist in a foreign service.

listened to his pleasing advice, that they should seek, not a more 
grateful, but a more wealthy, master; that they should embark for 
Greece, where, instead of the skins of squirrels, silk and gold would be 
the recompense of their service. At the same time the Russian prince 
admonished his Byzantine ally to disperse and employ, to recompense 
and restrain, these impetuous children of the North. Contemporary 
writers have recorded the introduction, name, and character of the 
Varangians: each day they rose in confidence and esteem; the whole 
body was assembled at Constantinople to perform the duty of guards; 
and their strength was recruited by a numerous band of their country- 
men from the island of Thule. On this occasion the vague appellation 
of Thule is applied to England; and the new Varangians were a colony 
of English and Danes who fled from the yoke of the Norman con- 
queror. The habits of pilgrimage and piracy had approximated the 
countries of the earth; these exiles were entertained in the Byzantine 
court; and they preserved, till the last age of the empire, the inheritance 
of spotless loyalty, and the use of the Danish or English tongue. With 
their broad and double-edged battle-axes on their shoulders, they at- 
tended the Greek emperor to the temple, the senate, and the hippo- 
drome; he slept and feasted under their trusty guard; and the keys of 
the palace, the treasury, and the capital, were held by the firm and 
faithful hands of the Varangians. 48 

In the tenth century the geography of Scythia was extended far be- 
yond the limits of ancient knowledge; and the monarchy of the Rus- 
sians obtains a vast and conspicuous place in the map of Constantine. 4 * 
The sons of Ruric were masters of the spacious province of Wolodomir, 
or Moscow; and, if they were confined on "that side by the hordes of 
the East, their Western frontier in those early days was enlarged to 
the Baltic Sea and the country of the Prussians. Their northern reign 
ascended above the sixtieth degree of latitude, over the Hyperborean 
regions, which fancy had peopled with monsters, or clouded with eter- 
nal darkness. To the south they followed the course of the Borys-

thenes, and approached with that river the neighbourhood of the Euxine 
Sea. The tribes that dwelt, or wandered, in this ample circuit were 
obedient to the same conqueror, and insensibly blended into the same 
nation. The language of Russia is a dialect of the Sclavonian; but in 
the tenth century these two modes of speech were different from each 
other; and, as the Sclavonians prevailed in the South, it may be pre- 
sumed that the original Russians of the North, the primitive subjects 
of the Varangian chief, were a portion of the Fennic race. With the 
emigration, union, or dissolution of the wandering tribes, the loose and 
indefinite picture of the Scythian desert has continually shifted. But 
the most ancient map of Russia affords some places which still retain 
their name and position; and the two capitals, Novogorod 50 and 
Kiow, 51 are coeval with the first age of the monarchy. Novogorod had 
not yet deserved the epithet of great, nor the alliance of the Hanseatic 
League, which diffused the streams of opulence and the principles of 
freedom. Kiow could not yet boast of three hundred churches, an in- 
numerable people, and a degree of greatness and splendour which was 
compared with Constantinople by those who had never seen the resi- 
dence of the Caesars. In their origin the two cities were no more than 
camps or fairs, the most convenient stations in which the barbarians 
might assemble for the occasional business of war or trade. Yet even 
these assemblies announce some progress in the arts of society; a new 
breed of cattle was imported from the southern provinces; and the 
spirit of commercial enterprise pervaded the sea and land, from the 
Baltic to the Euxine, from the mouth of the Oder to the port of Con- 
stantinople. In the days of idolatry and barbarism the Sclavonic city 
of Julin was frequented and enriched by the Normans, who had pru- 
dently secured a free mart of purchase and exchange. 52 From this 
harbour, at the entrance of the Oder, the corsair, or merchant, sailed 

80 The haughty proverb, " Who can resist God and the great Novogorod ? n 
is applied by M. Leyeque (Hist, de Russie, torn. i. p. 6oJ even to the times 
that preceded the reign of Ruric. In the course of his history he frequently 
celebrates this republic, which was suppressed A.D. 1475 (torn. ii. p. 252- 
266). That accurate traveller, Adam Olearius, describes (in 1635) the re- 
mains of Novogorod, and the route by sea and knd of the Holstein ambas- 
sadors, torn. i. p. 123-129. 

51 In hac magna civitate, quae est caput regni, plus trecentae ecclesiae habentur 
et nundinae octo, populi etiam jgnota manus (Eggehardus ad A.D. 1018, apud 
Bayer, torn. ix. p. 412). He likewise quotes (torn. x. p. 397) the words of 
the Saxon annalist, Cujus (Russia) metropolis est Chive, semula sceptri 
Constantinppolitani, quae est clarissimum decus Graecise. The fame of Kiow, 
especially in the eleventh century, had reached the German and the Arabian 
geographers.

Hist. Eccles. p. 19 [1. ii. c. 12] ). A strange exaggeration even in the eleventh 
century. The trade of the Baltic, and the Hanseatic League, are carefully 
treated in Anderson's Historical Deduction of Commerce; at least, in ouf 
language, I am not acquainted with any book so satis factory. 



334 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

in forty-three days to the eastern shores of the Baltic, the most dis- 
tant nations were intermingled, and the holy groves of Curland are 
said to have been decorated with Grecian and Spanish gold. 53 Between 
the sea and Novogorod an easy intercourse was discovered; in the 
summer, through a gulf, a lake, and a navigable river; in the winter 
season, over the hard and level surface of boundless snows. From the 
neighbourhood of that city the Russians descended the streams that fall 
into the Borysthenes; their canoes, of a single tree, were ^ laden with 
slaves of every age, furs of every species, the spoil of their beehives, 
and the hides of their cattle; and the whole' produce of the North was 
collected and discharged in the magazines of Kiow. The month of 
June was the ordinary season of the departure of the fleet: the timber 
of the canoes was framed into the oars and benches of more solid and 
capacious boats; and they proceeded without obstacle down the Borys- 
thenes, as far as the seven or thirteen ridges of rocks, which traverse 
the bed, and precipitate the waters, of the river. At the more shallow 
falls it was sufficient to lighten the vessels; but the deeper cataracts 
were impassable; and the mariners, who dragged their vessels and their 
slaves six miles over land, were exposed in this toilsome journey to 
the robbers of the desert. 5 * At the first island below the falls, the Rus- 
sians celebrated the festival of their escape: at a second, near the mouth 
of the river, they repaired then: shattered vessels for the longer and 
more perilous voyage of the Black Sea. If they steered along the 
coast, the Danube was accessible; with a, fair wind they could reach in 
thirty-six or forty hours the opposite shores of Anatolia; and Con- 
stantinople admitted the annual visit of the strangers of the North. 
They returned at the stated season with a rich cargo of corn, wine, 
and oil, the manufactures of Greece, and the spices of India. Some of 
their countrymen resided in the capital and provinces; and the national 
treaties protected the persons, effects, and privileges of the Russian 
merchant. 55 

"According to Adam of Bremen (e Situ Daniae, p. 58 [c. 223, p. 146, ed. 
Maderil), the old Curland extended eight days' journey along the coast; 
and by Feter Teutoburgicus (p. 68, A.D. 1326) Memel is defined as the common 
frontier of Russia, Curland, and Prussia. Aurum ibi plurimum (says Adam), 
divinis, auguribus, atque necromanticis omnes domus sunt plenae ... a toto 
orbe ibi responsa petuntur, maxime ab Hispanis (forsan Zupanis, id est 
regulis Lettoviae) et Graecis. The name of Greeks was applied to the Russians 
even before their conversion; an imperfect conversion, if they still con- 
sulted the wizards of Curland (Bayer, torn. x. p. 378, 402, etc.; Grotius, 
Prolegomen. ad Hist. Goth. p. 99). 

** Constantine only reckons seven cataracts^ of which he gives the Russian 
and Sclavonic names; but thirteen are enumerated by the Sieur de Beauplan, 
a French engineer, who had surveyed 1 the course and navigation of the 
Dnieper or Borysthenes (Description de 1'Ukraine, Rouen, 1660, a thin 
quarto) ; but the map is unluckily wanting in my copy, 

"Nestor, apud Leveque, Hist, de Russie, torn. i. p. 78-80. From the

,,'.- But the same communication which had been opened for the benefit," 
was soon abused for the injury, of mankind. In a period of one hun- 
dred and ninety years the Russians made four attempts to plunder the 
treasures of Constantinople: the event was various, but the motive, the 
means, and the object were the same in these naval expeditions. 50 The 
Russian traders had seen the magnificence, and tasted the luxury, of 
the city of the Caesars. A marvellous tale, and a scanty supply, excited 
the desires of their savage countrymen: they envied the gifts of nature 
which their climate denied; they coveted the works of art, which they 
were too lazy to imitate and too indigent to purchase; the Varangian 
princes unfurled the banners of piratical adventure, and their bravest 
soldiers were drawn from the nations that dwelt in the northern isles 
of the ocean. 57 The image of their naval armaments was revived in 
the last century in the fleets of the Cosacks, which issued from the 
Borysthenes to navigate the same seas for a similar purpose. 58 The 
Greek appellation of monoxyla, or single canoes, might be justly ap- 
plied to the bottom of their vessels. It was scooped out of tie long 
stem of a beech or willow, but the slight and narrow foundation was 
raised and continued on either side with planks, till it attained the 
length of sixty and the height of about twelve feet. These boats were 
built without a deck, but with two rudders and a mast; to move witti 
sails and oars; and to contain from forty to seventy men, with their 
arms, and provisions of fresh water and salt fish. The first trial of the 
Russians was made with two hundred boats; but when the national 
force was exerted they might arm against Constantinople a thousand 
or twelve hundred vessels. Their fleet was not much inferior to the 
royal navy of Agamemnon, but it was magnified in the eyes of fear 
to ten or fifteen times the real proportion of its strength and numbers. 
Had the Greek emperors, been endowed with foresight to discern, and 
vigour to prevent, perhaps they might have sealed with a maritime 
force the mouth of the Borysthenes. Their indolence abandoned the 
coast of Anatolia to the calamities of a piratical war, which, after an 
interval of six hundred years, again infested the Euxine; but as long 
as the capital was respected, the sufferings of a distant province escaped 
the notice both of the prince and the historian. The storm, which had 
swept along from the Phasis and Trebizond, at length burst on the Bos- 
position of Suania, between Chazaria and Lazica, is perfectly suitable; and 
the name was still used in the eleventh century (Cedren. torn. ii. p. 770 [p. 573,

phorus of Thrace; a strait of fifteen miles, in which the rude vessels 
of the Russian might have been stopped and destroyed by a more 
skilful adversary. In their first enterprise 50 under the princes of Kiow, 
they passed without opposition, and occupied the port of Constanti- 
nople in the absence of the emperor Michael, the son of Theophilus. 
Through a crowd of perils he landed at the palace stairs, and immedi- 
ately repaired to a church of the Virgin Mary. 00 By the advice of the 
patriarch, her garment, a precious relic, was drawn from the sanctuary 
and dipped in the sea; and a seasonable tempest, which determined the 
retreat of the Russians, was devoutly ascribed to the mother of God. 61 
The silence of the Greeks may inspire some doubt of the truth, or at 
least of the importance, of the second attempt by Oleg, the guardian of 
the sons of Ruric. 62 A strong barrier of arms and fortifications de- 
fended the Bosphorus: they were eluded by the usual expedient of 
drawing the boats over the isthmus; and this simple operation is de- 
scribed in the national chronicles as if the Russian fleet had sailed 
over dry land with a brisk and favourable gale. The leader of the 
third armament, Igor, the son of Ruric, had chosen a moment of weak- 
ness and decay, when the naval powers of the empire were employed 
Against the Saracens. But if courage be not wanting, the instruments 
of defence are seldom deficient. Fifteen broken and decayed galleys 
were boldly launched against the enemy; but instead of the single tube 
of Greek fire usually planted on the prow, the sides and stern of each 
vessel were abundantly supplied with that liquid combustible. The 
engineers were dexterous; the weather was propitious; many thousand 
Russians, who chose rather to be drowned than burnt, leaped into the 
sea; and those who escaped to the Thracian shore were inhumanly 
slaughtered by the peasants and soldiers. Yet one third of the canoes 
escaped into shallow water; and the next spring Igor was again pre- 
pared to retrieve his disgrace and claim his revenge. 68 After a long

peace, Jaroslaus, the great-grandson of Igor, resumed the same project 
of a naval invasion. A fleet, under the command of his son, was re- 
pulsed at the entrance of the Bosphorus, by the same artificial flames. 
But in the rashness of pursuit the vanguard of the Greeks was encom- 
passed by an irresistible multitude of boats and men; their provision of. 
fire was probably exhausted; and twenty-four galleys were either taken, 
sunk, or destroyed. 64 

Yet the threats or calamities of a Russian war were more fre- 
quently diverted by treaty than by arms. In these naval hostilities 
every disadvantage was on the side of the Greeks; their savage enemy 
afforded no mercy: his poverty promised no spoil; his impenetrable 
retreat deprived the conqueror of the hopes of revenge; and the pride 
or weakness of empire indulged an opinion that no honour could be 
gained or lost in the intercourse with barbarians. At first their de- 
mands were high and inadmissible, three pounds of gold for each sol- 
dier or mariner of the fleet: the Russian youth adhered to the design 
of conquest and glory; but the counsels of moderation were recom- 
mended by the hoary sages. " Be content," they said, " with the lib- 
eral offers of Caesar; is it not far better to obtain without a combat the 
possession of gold, silver, silks, and all the objects of our desires? Are 
we sure of victory? Can we conclude a treaty with the sea? We do 
not tread on the land; we float on the abyss of water, and a common 
death hangs over our heads." 6B The memory of these Arctic fleets, 
that seemed to descend from the polar circle, left a deep impression 
of terror on the Imperial city. By the vulgar of every rank it was as- 
serted and believed that an equestrian statue in the square of Taurus 
was secretly inscribed with a prophecy, how the Russians, in the last 
days, should become masters of Constantinople. 66 In our own time, a 
Russian armament, instead of sailing from the Borysthenes, has cir- 
cumnavigated the continent of Europe; and the Turkish capital has 
been threatened by a squadron of strong and lofty ships of war, each of 
which, with its naval science and thundering artillery, could have sunk 
or scattered a hundred canoes, such as those of their ancestors. Per- 
haps the present generation may yet behold the accomplishment of the 
prediction, of a rare prediction, of which the style is unambiguous and 
the date unquestionable.

338 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

By land the Russians were less formidable than by sea; and as they 
fought for the most part on foot, their irregular legions must often 
have been broken and overthrown by the cavalry of the Scythian 
hordes. Yet then: growing towns, however slight and imperfect, pre- 
sented a shelter to the subject, and a barrier to the enemy: the mon- 
archy of Kiow, till a fatal partition, assumed the dominion of the 
North; and the nations from the Volga to the Danube were subdued or 
repelled by the arms of Swatoslaus, 67 the son of Igor, the son of Oleg, 
the son of Ruric. The vigour of his mind and body was fortified by the 
hardships of a military and savage life. Wrapped in a bear-skin, Swa- 
toslaus usually slept on the ground, his head reclining on a saddle; his 
diet was coarse and frugal, and, like the heroes of Homer, 68 his meat 
(it was often horse-flesh) was broiled or roasted on the coals. The 
exercise of war gave stability and discipline to his army; and it may 
be presumed that no soldier was permitted to transcend the luxury of 
his chief. By an embassy from Nicephorus, the Greek emperor, he was 
moved to undertake the conquest of Bulgaria; and a gift of fifteen 
hundred pounds of gold was laid at his feet to defray the expense, or 
reward the toils, of the expedition. An army of sixty thousand men 
was assembled and embarked; they sailed from the Borysthenes to 
the Danube; their landing was effected on the Maesian shore; and, after 
a sharp encounter, the swords of the Russians prevailed against the 
arrows of the Bulgarian horse. The vanquished king sunk into the 
grave; his children were made captive; and his dominions, as far as 
Mount Haemus, were subdued or ravaged by the northern invaders. 
But instead of relinquishing his prey, and performing his engagements, 
the Varangian prince was more disposed to advance than to retire, 
and, had his ambition been crowned with success, the seat of empire' 
in that early period might have been transferred to a more temperate 
and fruitful climate. . Swatoslaus enjoyed and acknowledged the ad- 
vantages of his new position, in which he could unite, by exchange 
or rapine, the various productions of the earth. By an easy navigation 
he might draw from Russia the native commodities of furs, wax, and 
hydromel: Hungary supplied him with a breed of horses and the spoils 
of the West; and Greece abounded with gold, silver, and the foreign 
luxuries which his poverty had affected to disdain. The bands of 
Patzinacites, Chazars, and Turks repaired to the standard of victory; 
and the ambassador of Nicephorus betrayed his trust, assumed the 
purple, and promised to share with his new allies the treasures of the

Eastern world. From the banks of the Danube the Russian prince 
pursued his march as far as Adrianople; a formal summons to evacu- 
ate the Roman province was dismissed with contempt; and Swatoslaus 
fiercely replied that Constantinople might soon expect the presence of 
an enemy and a master. 

Nicephorus could no longer expel the mischief which he had intro- 
duced; but his throne and wife were inherited by John Zimisces, 69 who, 
in a diminutive body, possessed the spirit and abilities of a hero. The 
first victory of his lieutenants deprived the Russians of their foreign 
allies, twenty-thousand of whom were either destroyed by the sword, 
or provoked to revolt, or tempted to desert. Thrace was delivered, 
but seventy thousand barbarians were still in arms; and the legions 
that had been recalled from the new conquests of Syria, prepared, with 
the return of the spring, to march under the banners of a warlike prince, 
who declared himself the friend and avenger of the injured Bulgaria. 
The passes of Mount Haemus had been left unguarded; they were 
instantly occupied; the Roman vanguard was formed of the immortals 
(a proud imitation of the Persian style); the emperor led the .main 
body of ten thousand five hundred foot; and the rest of his forces fol- 
lowed in slow and cautious array, with the baggage and military en- 
gines. The first exploit of Zimisces was the reduction .of Marcianopolis, 
or Peristhlaba, 70 in two days; the trumpets sounded; the walls were 
scaled; eight thousand five hundred Russians were put to the sword.; 
and the sons of the Bulgarian king were rescued .from an ignominious 
prison, and invested with a nominal diadem, .After .these repeated 
losses Swatoslaus retired to the strong post of Dristra, on the banks of 
the Danube, and was pursued by an enemy who alternately employed 
the arms of celerity and delay. The Byzantine galleys ascended the 
river; the legions completed a line of circumvaUation; and the Russian 
prince was encompassed, assaulted, and famished in the fortifications 
of the camp and city. Many deeds of valour were performed; several 
desperate sallies were .attempted; nor was it till after a siege of sixty- 
five days that Swatoslaus yielded to his adverse fortune. The liberal 
terms which he obtained announce the prudence of the victor, who 
respected the valour and apprehended the despair of an uaconquered 
mind. The great duke of Russia bound himself, by -solemn impreca-

tions, to relinquish all hostile designs; a safe passage was opened for 
his return; the liberty of trade and navigation was restored; a meas- 
ure of corn was distributed to each of his soldiers; and the allowance 
of twenty-two thousand measures attests the loss and the remnant of 
the barbarians. After a painful voyage they again reached the mouth 
of the Borysthenes; but their provisions were exhausted; the season 
was unfavourable; they passed the winter on the ice; and, before 
they could prosecute their march, Swatoslaus was surprised and op- 
pressed by the neighbouring tribes, with whom the Greeks entertained 
a perpetual and useful correspondence. 71 Far different was the return 
of Zimisces, who was received in his capital like Canaillus or Marius, 
the saviours of ancient Rome. But the merit of the victory was attrib- 
uted by the pious emperor to the mother of God: and the image of the 
Virgin Mary, with the divine infant in her arms, was placed on a tri- 
umphal car, adorned with the spoils of war and the ensigns of Bulgarian 
royalty. Zimisces made his public entry on horseback; the diadem on 
his head, a crown of laurel in his hand; and Constantinople was aston- 
ished to applaud the martial virtues of her sovereign. 72 

Photius of Constantinople, a patriarch whose ambition was equal 
to his curiosity, congratulates himself and the Greek church on the 
conversion of the Russians. 73 Those fierce and bloody barbarians had 
been persuaded, by the voice of reason and religion, to acknowledge 
Jesus for their God, the Christian missionaries for their teachers, and 
the Romans for their friends and brethren. His triumph was transient 
and premature. In 'the various fortune of their piratical adventures, 
some Russian chiefs might allow themselves to be sprinkled with the 
waters of baptism; and a Greek bishop, with the name of metropolitan, 
might administer the sacraments in the church of Kiow to a congre^ 
gation of slaves and natives. But the seed of the Gospel was sown on 
a barren soil: many were the apostates, the converts were few, and the 
baptism of Olga may be fixed as the era of Russian Christianity. 74 A 
female, perhaps of the basest origin, who could revenge the death and 
assume the sceptre of her husband Igor, must have been endowed with

those active virtues which command the fear and obedience of bar- 
barians. In a moment of foreign and domestic peace she sailed from 
Kiow to Constantinople, and the emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus 
has described, with minute diligence, the ceremonial of her reception 
in his capital and palace. The steps, the titles, the salutations, the 
banquet, the presents, were exquisitely adjusted to gratify the vanity 
of the stranger, with due reverence to the superior majesty of the 
purple. 75 In the sacrament of baptism she received the venerable name 
of the empress Helena; and her conversion might be preceded or fol- 
lowed by her uncle, two interpreters, sixteen damsels. of a higher, and 
eighteen of a lower rank, twenty-two domestics or ministers, and forty- 
four Russian merchants, who composed the retinue of the great prin- 
cess Olga. After her return to Kiow and Novogorod, she firmly per- 
sisted in her new religion; but her labours in the propagation of the 
Gospel were not crowned with success; and both her family and nation 
adhered with obstinacy or indifference to the gods of their fathers. 
Her son Swatoslaus was apprehensive of the scorn and ridicule of his 
companions; and her grandson Wolodomir devoted his youthful zeal 
to multiply and decorate the monuments of ancient worship. The sav- 
age deities of the North were still propitiated with human sacrifices: 
in the choice of the victim a citizen was preferred to a stranger, a 
Christian to an idolater; and the father who defended his son from 
the sacerdotal knife was involved in the same doom by the rage of a 
fanatic tumult. Yet the lessons and example of the pious Olga had 
made a deep, though secret, impression on the minds of the prince and 
people: the Greek missionaries continued to preach, to dispute, and to 
baptise; and the ambassadors or merchants of Russia compared the 
idolatry of the woods with the elegant superstition of Constantinople. 
They had gazed with admiration on the dome of St. Sophia: the lively 
pictures of saints and martyrs, the riches of the altar, the number and 
vestments of the priests, the pomp and order of the ceremonies; they 
were edified by the alternate succession of devout silence and har- 
monious song; nor was it difficult to persuade them that a choir of 
angels descended each day from heaven to join in the devotion of the 
Christians. 70 But the conversion of Wolodomir was determined, or 
hastened, by his desire of a Roman bride. At the same time, and in 
the city of Cherson, the rites of baptism and marriage were celebrated 
by the Christian pontiff: the city he restored to the emperor Basil, the 
brother of his spouse; but the brazen gates were transported, as it is 
said, to Novogorod, and erected before the first church as a trophy of 
his victory and faith. 77 At his despotic command Peroun, the god of

thunder, whom he had so long adored, was dragged through the streets 
of Kiow, and twelve sturdy barbarians battered with dubs the mis- 
shapen image, which was indignantly cast into the waters of the Borys- 
thenes. The edict of Wolodomir had proclaimed that all who should 
refuse the rites of baptism would be treated as the enemies of God 
and their prince; and the rivers were constantly rilled with many 
thousands of obedient Russians, who acquiesced in the truth and 
excellence of a doctrine which had been embraced by the great duke 
and his boyars. In the next generation the* relics of paganism were 
finally extirpated; but as the two brothers of Wolodomir had died with- 
out baptism, their bones were taken from the grave and sanctified by 
an irregular and posthumous sacrament. 

In the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries of the Christian era the 
reign of the Gospel and of the church was extended over Bulgaria, 
Hungary, Bohemia, Saxony, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Poland, and 
Russia, 78 The triumphs of apostolic zeal were repeated in the iron 
age of Christianity; and the northern and eastern regions of Europe 
submitted to a religion more different in theory than in practice from 
the worship of their native idols. A laudable ambition excited the 
monks both of Germany and Greece to visit the tents and huts of the 
barbarians: poverty, hardships, and dangers were the lot of the first 
missionaries; their courage was active and patient; their motive pure 
and meritorious; their present reward consisted in the testimony of 
their conscience and the respect of a grateful people; but the fruitful 
harvest of their toils was inherited and enjoyed by the proud and 
wealthy prelates of succeeding times. The first conversions were free 
and spontaneous: a holy life and an eloquent tongue were the only arms 
of the missionaries; but the domestic fables of the pagans were silenced 
by the miracles and visions of the strangers; and the favourable temper 
of the chiefs was accelerated by the dictates of vanity and interest. 
The leaders of nations, who were saluted with the titles of kings and 
saints, 79 held it lawful and pious to impose the Catholic faith on their 
subjects and neighbours: the coast of the Baltic, from Holstein to the 

p. 56) as the place of Wolodomir's baptism and marriage;- and both the 
tradition and the gates are still preserved at Novogorod. Yet an observing 
traveller transports the brazen gates from Magdeburg in Germany (Coxe's 
Travels into Russia, etc., vol. i. p. 452), and quotes an inscription which seems 
to justify his opinion. The modern reader must not confound this old Cherson 
of the Tauric or Crimaean peninsula with a new city of the same name which 
has arisen near the mouth of the Borysthenes, and was lately honoured by 
the memorable interview of the empress of Russia with the emperor of the 
West.

gulf of Finland, was invaded under the standard of the cross; and the 
reign of idolatry was closed by the conversion of Lithuania in the four- 
teenth century. Yet truth and candour must acknowledge that the 
conversion of the North imparted many temporal benefits both to the 
old and the new Christians. The rage of war, inherent to the human 
species, could not be healed by the evangelic precepts of charity and 
peace; and the ambition of Catholic princes has renewed in every age 
the calamities of hostile contention. But the admission of the bar- 
barians into the pale of civil and ecclesiastical society delivered Eu- 
rope from the depredations, by sea and land, of the Normans, the Hun- 
garians, and the Russians, who learned to spare their brethren and 
cultivate their possessions. 80 The establishment of law and order was 
promoted by the influence of the clergy; and the rudiments of art and 
science were introduced into the savage countries of the globe. The 
liberal piety of the Russian princes engaged in their service the most 
skilful of the Greeks to decorate the cities and instruct the inhabitants: 
the dome and the paintings of St. Sophia were rudely copied in the 
churches of Kiow and Novogorod: the writings of the fathers were 
translated into the Sclavonic idiom; and three hundred noble youths 
were invited or compelled to attend the lessons of the college of Jaros- 
laus. It, should appear that Russia might have derived an early and 
rapid improvement from her peculiar connection with the church and 
state of Constantinople, which in that age so justly despised the ignor- 
ance of the Latins. But the Byzantine nation was servile, solitary, and 
verging to a hasty decline: after the fall of Kiow the navigation of the 
Borysthenes was forgotten; the great princes of Wolodomir and Mos- 
cow were separated from the sea and Christendom; and the divided 
monarchy was oppressed by the ignominy and blindness of Tartar serv- 
itude. 81 The Sclavonic and Scandinavian kingdoms, which had been 
converted by the Latin missionaries, were exposed, it is true, to the 
spiritual jurisdiction and temporal claims of the popes; 82 but they were 
united, in language and religious worship, with each other and with

THE three great nations of the world, the Greeks, the Saracens, and 
the Franks, encountered each other on the theatre of Italy. 1 The 
southern provinces, which now compose the kingdom of Naples, were 
subject, for the most part, to the Lombard dukes and princes of Bene- 
ventum 2 so powerful in war, that they checked for a moment the 
genius of Charlemagne so liberal in peace, that they maintained in 
their capital an academy of thirty-two philosophers and grammarians. 
The division of this flourishing state produced the rival principalities 
of Benevento, Salerno, and Capua; and the thoughtless ambition or 
revenge of the competitors invited the Saracens to the ruin of their 
common inheritance. During a calamitous period of two hundred 
years Italy was exposed to a repetition of wounds, which the invaders 
were not capable of healing by the union and tranquillity of a perfect 
conquest. Their frequent and almost annual squadrons issued from 
the port of Palermo, and were entertained with too much indulgence 
by the Christians of Naples: the more formidable fleets were prepared 
on the African coast; and even the Arabs of Andalusia were sometimes 
tempted to assist or oppose the Moslems of an adverse sect. In the 
revolution of human events a new ambuscade was concealed in the 
Caudine forks, the fields of Cannae were bedewed a second time with

which, imder a superficial title, contains much genuine learning and industry.

the blood of the Africans, and the sovereign of Rome again attacked 
or defended the walls of Capua and Tarentum. A colony of Saracens 
had been planted at Bari, which commands the entrance of the Adri- 
atic Gulf; and their impartial depredations provoked the resentment 
and conciliated the union of the two emperors. An offensive alliance 
was concluded between Basil the Macedonian, the first of his race, and 
Lewis the great-grandson of Charlemagne; 8 and each party supplied 
the deficiencies of his associate. It would have been imprudent in the 
Byzantine monarch to transport his stationary troops of Asia to an 
Italian campaign; and the Latin arms would have been insufficient if 
his superior navy had not occupied the mouth of the Gulf. The for- 
tress of Bari was invested by the infantry of the Franks, and by the 
cavalry and galleys of the Greeks; and, after a defence of four years&gt; 
the Arabian emir submitted to the clemency of Lewis, who commanded 
in person the operations of the siege. This important conquest had 
been achieved by the concord of the East and West; but their recent 
amity was soon embittered by the mutual complaints of jealousy and 
pride. The Greeks assumed as their own the merit of the conquest 
and the pomp of the triumph, extolled the greatness of their powers, 
and affected to deride the intemperance and sloth of the handful of 
barbarians who appeared under the banners of tie Carlovingian prince. 
His reply is expressed with the eloquence of indignation and truth: 
" We confess the magnitude of your preparations," says the great- 
grandson of Charlemagne. "Your armies were indeed as numerous 
as a cloud of summer locusts, who darken the day, flap their wings, 
and, after a short flight, tumble weary and breathless to the ground. 
Like them, ye sunk after a feeble effort; ye were vanquished by youi 
own cowardice, and withdrew from the scene of action to injure and 
despoil our Christian subjects of the Sclavonian coast. We were few 
in number, and why were we few? because, after a tedious expectation 
of your arrival, I had dismissed my host, and retained only a chosen 
band of warriors to continue the blockade of the city. If they in- 
dulged their hospitable feasts in the face of danger and death, did these 
feasts abate the vigour of their enterprise? Is it by your fasting that 
the walls of Bari have been overturned? Did not these valiant Franks, 
diminished as they were by languor and fatigue, intercept and vanquish 
the three most powerful emirs of the Saracens? and did not their defeat 
precipitate the fall of the city? Bari is now fallen; Tarentum trem- 
bles; Calabria will be delivered; and, if we command the sea, the 
island of Sicily may be rescued from the hands of the infidels. My 
brother " (a name most offensive to the vanity of the Greek), " accel- 
erate your naval succours, respect your allies, and distrust your flat- 
terers." *

These lofty hopes were soon extinguished by the death of Lewis, and 
the decay of the Carlovingian house; and whoever might deserve the 
honour, the Greek emperors, Basil and his son Leo, secured the advan- 
tage, of the reduction of Bari. The Italians of Apulia and Calabria 
were persuaded or compelled to acknowledge their supremacy, and an 
ideal line from Mount Garganus to the bay of Salerno leaves the far 
greater part of the kingdom of Naples under the dominion of the 
Eastern empire. Beyond that line the dukes or republics of Amalfi 5 
and Naples, who had never forfeited their voluntary allegiance, rejoiced 
in the neighbourhood of their lawful sovereign; and Amalfi was en- 
riched by supplying Europe with the produce and manufactures of 
Asia. But the Lombard princes of Benevento, Salerno, and Capua c 
were reluctantly torn from the communion of the Latin world, and 
too often violated their oaths of servitude and tribute. The city of 
Bari rose to dignity and wealth as the metropolis of the new theme or 
province of Lombardy; the title of patrician, and afterwards the sin- 
gular name of Catapan* was assigned to the supreme governor; and the 
policy both of the church and state was modelled in exact subordination 
to the throne of Constantinople. As long as the sceptre was disputed 
by the princes of Italy, their efforts were feeble and adverse; and the 
Greeks resisted or eluded the forces of Germany which descended from 
the Alps under the Imperial standard of the Othos. The first and 
greatest of those Saxon princes was compelled to relinquish the siege of 
Bari: the second, after the loss of his stoutest bishops and barons, es- 
caped with honour from the bloody field of Crotona. On that day the 
scale of war was turned against the Franks by the valour of the Sara-

anonymous historian of Salerno.

his party about the same time, and Camillo Pellegrino (Script. Rer. Ital. torn. ii. 
pars L^p. 285) has nicely discerned this change in the style of the anonymous 
Chronicle. On the rational ground of history and language, Liutprand (p. 480) 
had asserted the Latin claim to Apulia and Calabria.

nobles of the first rank, the great valvassors of Italy.

cens. s These corsairs had indeed been driven by the Byzantine fleets 
from the fortresses and coasts of Italy; but a sense of interest was more 
prevalent than superstition or resentment, and the caliph of Egypt had 
transported forty thousand Moslems to the aid of his Christian ally. 
The successors of Basil amused themselves with the belief that the 
conquest of Lombardy had been achieved, and was still preserved, by 
the justice of their laws, the virtues of their ministers, and the grati- 
tude of a people whom they had rescued from anarchy and oppression. 
A series of rebellions might dart a ray of truth into the palace of Con- 
stantinople; and the illusions of flattery were dispelled by the easy 
and rapid success of the Norman adventurers. 

The revolution of human affairs had produced in Apulia and Cala- 
bria a melancholy contrast between the age of Pythagoras and' the 
tenth century of the Christian era. At the former period the coast of 
Great Greece (as it was then styled) was planted with free and opulent 
cities: these cities were peopled with soldiers, artists, and philosophers: 
and the military strength of Tarentum, Sybaris, or Crotona was not 
inferior to that of a powerful kingdom. At the second era these once 
flourishing provinces were clouded with ignorance, impoverished by 
tyranny, and depopulated by barbarian war: nor can we severely ac- 
cuse the exaggeration of a contemporary, that a fair and ample dis- 
trict was reduced to the same desolation which had covered the earth 
after the general deluge. 9 Among the hostilities of the Arabs, the 
Franks, and the Greeks in the southern Italy, I shall select two or 
three anecdotes expressive of their national manners, i. It was the 
amusements of the Saracens to profane, as well as to pillage, the mon- 
asteries and churches. At the siege of Salerno a Musulman chief 
spread his couch on the communion table, and on that altar sacrificed 
each night the virginity of a Christian nun. As he wrestled with a 
reluctant maid, a beam in the roof was accidentally or dexterously 
thrown down on his bead; and the death of the lustful emir was im- 
puted to the wrath of Christ, which was at length awakened to the 
defence of his faithful spouse. 10 2. The Saracens besieged the cities of

little Chronicle of Beneventum (torn. ii. pars i. p. 280) gives a far different 
character of the Greeks during the five years (A.D. 891-896) that Leo was 
master of the city. 

* Calabriam adeunt, eamque inter se diyisam reperientes funditus depopulati 
sunt (or depopularunt) , ita ut deserta sit velut in diluvio. Such is the text 
of Herempert, or Erchempert, according to the two editions of Carraccioli 
(Rer. Italic. Script, torn. v. p. 23) and of Camillo Pellegrino (torn. ii. pars i. 
p. 246). Both were extremely scarce when they were reprinted by Muratori. 

10 Baronius (Annal. Eccles. A.D. 874, No. 2) has drawn this story from a MS. 
of Erchempert, who died at Capua only fifteen years after the event. But the 
Cardinal was deceived by a false title, and we can only quote the anonymous 
Chronicle of Salerno (Paralipomena, c. no), composed towards the end of 
the tenth century, and published in the second volume of Muratori's Collection, 
See the Dissertations of Camillo Pellegrino, torn. ii. pars i. p. 231-2811 etc. 



348 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

Beneventum and Capua: after a vain appeal to the successors of 
Charlemagne, the Lombards implored the clemency and aid of the 
Greek emperor. 11 A fearless citizen dropped from the walls, passed 
the intrenchments, accomplished his commission, and fell into the hands 
of the barbarians as he was returning with the welcome news. They 
commanded him to assist their enterprise, and deceive his countrymen, 
with the assurance that wealth and honours should be the reward of 
his falsehood, and that his sincerity would be punished with immedi- 
ate death. He affected to yield, but as soon as he was conducted within 
hearing of the Christians on the rampart, " Friends and brethren," he 
cried with a loud voice, " be bold and patient; maintain the city; your 
sovereign is informed of your distress, and your deliverers are at hand, 
I know my doom, and commit my wife and children to your gratitude." 
The rage of the Arabs confirmed his evidence; and the self-devoted 
patriot was transpierced with a hundred spears. He deserves to live 
in the memory of the virtuous, but the repetition of the same story in 
ancient and modern times may sprinkle some doubts on the reality of 
this generous deed. 12 3. The recital of the third incident may provoke 
a smile amidst the horrors of war. Theobald, marquis of Camerino 
and Spoleto, 13 supported the rebels of Beneventum; and his wanton 
cruelty was not incompatible in that age with the character of a hero. 
His captives of the Greek nation or party were castrated without mercy, 
and the outrage was aggravated by a cruel jest, that he wished to pre- 
sent the emperor with a supply of eunuchs, the most precious orna- 
ments of the Byzantine court. The garrison of a castle had been de- 
feated in a sally, and the prisoners were sentenced to the customary 
operation. But the sacrifice was disturbed by the intrusion of a 
frantic female, who, with bleeding cheeks, dishevelled hair, and im- 
portunate clamours, compelled the marquis to listen to her complaint. 
" Is it thus," she cried, " ye magnanimous heroes, that ye wage war 
igainst women, against women who have never injured ye, and whose 
only arms are the distaff and the loom? " Theobald denied the charge, 

11 Constantine Porphyrogenitus (in Vit. Basil, c. 58, p. 183 [p. 2g6, ed. 
Bonn]) is the original author of this story. He .places it under the reigns of 
Basil and Lewis II. ; yet the reduction of Beneventum by title Greeks is dated 
A.D. 891, after the decease of both of those princes. 

"In the year 663 the same tragedy is described by Paul the Deacon (de 
Gestis Langobard. 1. v. c. 7, 8, p. 870, 871, edit. Grot.), under the walls of the 
same city of Beneventum. But the actors are different, and the guilt is 
imputed to the Greeks themselves, which in the Byzantine edition is applied 
to the Saracens. In the late war in Germany, M. d'Assas, a French officer 
of the regiment of Auvergne, is said to have devoted himself in a similar 
manner. His behaviour is the more heroic, as mere silence was required by 
the enemy who had made him prisoner (Voltaire, Siecle de Louis XV. c. 33, 
torn. ix. p. 172). 

"Theobald, who is styled Heros by Liutprand, was properly duke of Spoleto 
and marquis of Camerino, from the year 926 to 935. The title and office 
of marquis (commander of the march or frontier) was introduced into Italy 
by the French emperors (Abrege Chronologique, torn. ii. p. 645-732* etc.). 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 349 

and protested that, since the Amazons, he had never heard of a female 
war. " And how," she furiously exclaimed, " can you attack us more di- 
rectly, how can you wound us in a more vital part, than by robbing our 
husbands of what we most dearly cherish, the source of our joys, and 
the hope of our posterity? The plunder of our flocks and herds I 
have endured without a murmur, but this fatal injury, this irreparable 
loss, subdues my patience, and calls aloud on the justice of heaven 
and earth." A general laugh applauded her eloquence; the savage 
Franks, inaccessible to pity, were moved by her ridiculous, yet rational, 
despair; and with the deliverance of the captives she obtained the resti- 
tution of her effects. As she returned in triumph to the castle she was 
overtaken by a messenger, to inquire, in the name of Theobald, what 
punishment should be inflicted on her husband, were he again taken 
in arms? " Should such," she answered without hesitation, " be his 
guilt and misfortune, he has eyes, and a nose, and hands, and feet. 
These are his own, and these he may deserve to forfeit by his personal 
offences. But let my lord be pleased to spare what his little handmaid 
presumes to claim as her peculiar and lawful property." " 

The establishment of the Normans in the kingdoms of Naples and 
Sicily 15 is an event most romantic in its origin, and in its consequences 
most important both to Italy and the Eastern empire. The broken 
provinces of the Greeks, Lombards, and Saracens were exposed to every 
invader, and every sea and land were invaded by the adventurous spirit 
of the Scandinavian pirates. After a long indulgence of rapine and 
slaughter, a fair and ample territory was accepted, occupied, and 
named, by the Normans of France: they renounced their gods for the 
God of the Christians; 10 and the dukes of Normandy acknowledged 
themselves the vassals of the successors of Charlemagne and Capet. 
The savage fierceness which they had brought from the snowy moun- 
tains of Norway was refined, without being corrupted, in a warmer 
climate; the companions of Rollo insensibly mingled with the natives;

poor Sterne, that it is hard if I may not transcribe with caution what a bishop 
could write without scruple. What if I had translated, ut viris certetis 
testiculos -amputate, in quibus nostri corporis refocillatio, etc? 

18 The original monuments of the Normans in Italy are collected in the fifth 
volume of Muratori; and among these we may distinguish the poem of Wil- 
liam Appulus (p. 245-278) and the history of Galfridus (Jeffrey) Malaterra 
(p. 537-607). Both were natives of France, but they wrote on the spot, in 
the age of the first conquerors (before A.D. iioo), and with the spirit of free- 
men. It is needless to recapitulate the compilers and critics of Italian history, 
Sigonius, Baronius, Pagi, Giannone, Muratori, St. Marc, etc., whom I have 
always consulted, and never copied. 

M Some of the first converts were baptised ten or twelve times, for the sake 
of the white garment usually given at this ceremony. At the funeral of 
Rollo, the gifts to monasteries for the repose of his soul were accompanied 
by a sacrifice of one hundred captives. But in a generation or two the 
national change was pure and general. 



350 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

they imbibed the manners, language, 17 and gallantry of the French 
nation; and, in a martial age, the Normans might claim the palm of 
valour and glorious achievements. Of the fashionable superstitions, 
they embraced with ardour the pilgrimages of Rome, Italy, and the 
Holy Land. In this active devotion their minds and bodies were in- 
vigorated by exercise: danger was the incentive, novelty the recom- 
pense; and the prospect of the world was decorated by wonder, cre- 
dulity, and ambitious hope. They confederated for their mutual de- 
fence; and the robbers of the Alps, who had been allured by the 
garb of a pilgrim, were often chastised by the arm of a warrior. In 
one of these pious visits to the cavern of Mount Garganus in Apulia, 
which had been sanctified by the apparition of the archangel Michael, 18 
they were accosted by a stranger in the Greek habit, but who soon 
revealed himself as a rebel, a fugitive, and a mortal foe of the Greek 
empire. His name was Melo; a noble citizen of Bari, who, after 
an unsuccessful revolt, was compelled to seek new allies and avengers 
of his country. The bold appearance of the Normans revived his 
hopes and solicited his confidence: they listened to the complaints, and 
still more to the promises, of the patriot. The assurance of wealth 
demonstrated the justice of his cause; and they viewed, as the inherit- 
ance of the brave, the fruitful land which was oppressed by effeminate 
tyrants. On their return to "Normandy they kindled a spark of enter- 
prise, and a small but intrepid band was freely associated for the deliv- 
erance of Apulia. They passed the Alps by separate roads, and in the 
disguise of pilgrims; but in the neighbourhood of Rome they were saluted 
by the chief of Bari, who supplied the more indigent with arms and 
horses, and instantly led them to the field of action. In the first con- 
flict their valour prevailed; but in the second engagement they were 
overwhelmed by the numbers and military engines of the Greeks, and

indignantly retreated with their faces to the enemy. The unfortunate 
Melo ended his life a suppliant at the court of Germany: his Norman 
followers, excluded from their native and their promised land, wan- 
dered among the hills and valleys of Italy, and earned their daily 
subsistence by the sword. To that formidable sword the princes of 
Capua, Beneventum, Salerno, and Naples alternately appealed in their 
domestic quarrels; the superior spirit and discipline of the Normans 
gave victory to the side which they espoused; and their cautious pol- 
icy observed the balance of power, lest the preponderance of any rival 
state should render their aid less important and their service less profit- 
able. Their first asylum was a strong camp in the depth of the marshes 
of Campania; but they were soon endowed by the liberality of the 
duke of Naples with a more plentiful and permanent seat. Eight miles 
from his residence, as a bulwark against Capua, the town of Aversa was 
built and fortified for their use; and they enjoyed as their own the 
corn and fruits, the meadows and groves, of that fertile district. The 
report of their success attracted every year new swarms of pilgrims 
and soldiers: the poor were urged by necessity; the rich were excited 
by hope; and the brave and active spirits of Normandy were impatient 
of ease and ambitious of renown. The independent standard of Aversa 
afforded shelter and encouragement to the outlaws of the province, to 
every fugitive who had escaped from the injustice or justice of his 
superiors; and these foreign associates were quickly assimilated in man- 
ners and language to the Gallic colony. The first leader of the Nor- 
mans was Count Rainulf; and, in the origin of society, pre-eminence 
of rank is the reward and the proof of superior merit. 19 

Since the conquest of Sicily by the Arabs, the Grecian emperors had 
been anxious to regain that valuable possession; but their efforts, how- 

18 See the first book of William Appulus. His words are applicable to every 
swarm of barbarians and freebooters:

Confugiebat, eum gratanter- suscipiebant : 
Moribus .et lingua quoscumque venire videbant 
Informant propria; gens efficiatur ut una. [p. 255.] 
And elsewhere, of the native adventurers of Normandy: 

Pars parat, exiguse vel opes aderant quia nullae: 
Pars, quia de magnis majora subire volebant. [p. 254.] 
[This account is not accurate. After the retreat of the emperor Henry 
II., the Normans, united under the command of Rainulf, had taken possession 
of Aversa, then a small castle in the duchy of Naples. They had been 
masters of it a few years when Pandulf the Fourth, prince of Capua, found 
means to take Naples by surprise. Sergius, master of the soldiers, and head 
of the republic, with the principal citizens, abandoned a city in which he could 
not behold without horror the establishment of a foreign dominion. He 
retired to Aversa, and when, with the assistance of the Greeks and of ^the 
citizens faithful to their country, he had collected money enough to satisfy 
the rapacity of the Normans, he advanced at their head to attack the garrison 
o'f the prince of Capua, defeated it, and re-entered Naples. It was then that 
he confirmed the Normans in the possession of Aversa and its territory, 
which he raised into a count's fief, and granted the investiture thereof to 
Rainulf. O. S.]

ever strenuous, had been opposed by the distance and the sea. Their 
costly armaments, after a gleam of success, added new pages of calam- 
ity and disgrace to the Byzantine annals: twenty thousand of their 
best troops were lost in a single expedition; and the victorious Moslems 
derided the policy of a nation which intrusted eunuchs not only with 
the custody of their women, but with the command of their men. 20 . 
After a reign of two hundred years, the Saracens were ruined by their 
divisions. 21 The emir disclaimed the authority of the king of Tunis; 
the people rose against the emir; the cities were usurped by the chiefs; 
each meaner rebel was independent in his village or castle; and the 
weaker of two rival brothers implored the friendship of the Christians. 
In every service of danger the Normans were prompt and useful; and 
five hundred knights, or warriors on horseback, were enrolled by Ar- 
duin, the agent and interpreter of the Greeks, under the standard of 
Maniaces, governor of Lombardy. Before their landing the brothers 
were reconciled; the union of Sicily and Africa was restored; and the 
island was guarded to the water's edge. The Normans led the van, and 
the Arabs of Messina felt the valour of an untried foe. In a second 
action the emir of Syracuse was unhorsed and transpierced by the iron 
arm of William of Hauteville. In a third engagement his intrepid com- 
panions discomfited the host of sixty thousand Saracens, and left the 
Greeks no more than the labour of the pursuit: a splendid victory; but 
of which the pen of the historian may divide the merit with the lance 
of the Normans. It is, however, true, that they essentially promoted 
the success of Maniaces, who reduced thirteen cities, and the greater 
part of Sicily, under the obedience of the emperor. But his military 
fame was sullied by ingratitude and tyranny. In the division of the 
spoil the deserts of his brave auxiliaries were forgotten; and neither 
their avarice nor their pride could brook this injurious treatment. They 
complained by the mouth of their interpreter: their complaint was dis- 
regarded; their interpreter was scourged; the sufferings were his; the 
insult and resentment belonged to those whose sentiments he had de- 
livered. Yet they dissembled till they had obtained, or stolen, a safe 
passage to the Italian continent: their brethren of Aversa sympathised 
in their indignation, and the province of Apulia was invaded as the 
forfeit of the debt. 22 Above twenty years after the first emigration, 
the Normans took the field with no more than seven hundred horse and 
five hundred foot; and after the recall of the Byzantine legions 23 from

the Sicilian war, their numbers are magnified to the amount of three- 
score thousand men. Their herald proposed the option of battle or re- 
treat; "Of battle," was the unanimous cry of the Normans; and one 
of their stoutest warriors, with a stroke of his fist, felled to the ground 
the horse of the Greek messenger. He was dismissed with a fresh 
horse; the insult was concealed from the Imperial troops; but in two 
successive battles they were- more fatally instructed of the prowess of 
their adversaries. In the plains of Cannae the Asiatics fled before the 
adventurers of France; the duke of Lombardy was made prisoner; the 
Apulians acquiesced in a new dominion; and the four places of Bari, 
Otranto, Brundusium, and Tarentum were alone saved in the ship- 
wreck of the Grecian fortunes. From this era we may date the estab- 
lishment of the Norman power, which soon eclipsed the infant colony 
of Aversa. Twelve counts 24 were chosen by the popular suffrage; and 
age, birth, and merit were the motives of their choice. The tributes of 
their peculiar districts were appropriated to their use; and each count 
erected a fortress in the midst of his lands, and at the head of his vas- 
sals. In the centre of the province the common habitation of Melphi 
was reserved as the metropolis and citadel of the republic; a house and 
separate quarter was allotted to each of the twelve counts; and the na- 
tional concerns were regulated by this military senate. The first of his 
peers, their president and general, was entitled Count of Apulia; and 
this dignity was conferred on William of the iron arm, who, in the lan- 
guage of the age, is styled a lion in battle, a lamb in society, and an 
angel in council. 25 The manners of his countrymen are fairly delineated 
by a contemporary and national historian. 26 " The Normans," says 

of the Thracesians (Lydia : consult Constantine de Thematibus, i. 3, 4 [torn. iii. 
p. 22 sqq. t ed. Bonn], with Delisle's map) ; and afterwards names the Pisidians 
and Lycaonians with the foederati.

Malaterra, " are a cunning and revengeful people; eloquence and dis- 
simulation appear to be their hereditary qualities: they can stoop to 
flatter; but, unless they are curbed by the restraint of law, they indulge 
the licentiousness of nature and passion. Their princes affect the praise 
of popular munificence; the people observe the medium, or rather^ blend 
the extremes, of avarice and prodigality; and in their eager thirst of 
wealth and dominion, they despise whatever they possess, and hope 
whatever they desire. Arms and horses, the luxury of dress, the exer- 
cises of hunting and hawking 27 are the delight of the Normans; but, 
on pressing occasions, they can endure with incredible patience the in- 
clemency of every climate, and the toil and abstinence of a military 
life." 28 

The Normans of Apulia were seated on the verge of the two empires, 
and, according to the policy of the hour, they accepted the investiture 
of their lands from the sovereigns of Germany or Constantinople. But 
the firmest title of these adventurers was the right to conquest: they 
neither loved nor trusted; they were neither trusted nor beloved; the 
contempt of the princes was mixed with fear, and the fear of the na- 
tives was mingled with hatred and resentment. Every object of desire, 
a horse, a woman, a garden, tempted and gratified the rapaciousness of 
the strangers, 29 and the avarice of their chiefs was only coloured by the 
more specious names of ambition and glory. The twelve counts were 
sometimes joined in a league of injustice; in their domestic quarrels 
they disputed the spoils of the people; the virtues of William were 
buried in his grave; and Drogo, his brother and successor, was better 
qualified to lead the valour, than to restrain the violence, of his peers. 
Under the reign of Constantine Monomachus, the policy, rather than

father might recommend him to the Normans, and he had already en- 
gaged their voluntary service to quell the revolt of Maniaces, and to 
avenge their own and the public injury. It was the design of Con- 
stantine to transplant this warlike colony from the Italian provinces 
to the Persian war, and the son of Melo distributed among the chiefs 
the gold and manufactures of Greece as the first-fruits of the Imperial 
bounty. But his arts were baffled by the sense and spirit of the con- 
querors of Apulia: his gifts, or at least his proposals, were rejected, and 
they unanimously refused to relinquish their possessions and their hopes 
for the distant prospect of Asiatic fortune. After the means of per- 
suasion had failed, Argyrus resolved to compel or to destroy: the Latin 
powers were solicited against the common enemy, and an offensive alli- 
ance was formed of the pope and the two emperors of the East and 
West. The throne of St. Peter was occupied by Leo the Ninth, a 
simple saint, 82 of a temper most apt to deceive himself and the world, 
and whose venerable character would consecrate with the name of piety 
the measures least compatible with the practice of religion. His hu- 
manity was affected by the complaints, perhaps the calumnies, of an 
injured people; the impious Normans had interrupted the payment of 
tithes, and the temporal sword might be lawfully unsheathed against 
the sacrilegious robbers who were deaf to the censures of the church. 
As a German of noble birth and royal kindred, Leo had free access to 
the court and confidence of the emperor Henry the Third, and in search 
of arms and allies his ardent zeal transported him from Apulia to Sax- 
ony, from the Elbe to the Tiber. During these hostile preparations, 
Argyrus indulged himself in the use of secret and guilty Weapons: a 
crowd of Normans became the victims of public or private revenge,, 
and the valiant Drogo was murdered in a church. But his spirit sur- 
vived in his brother Humphrey, the third count of Apulia. The assas- 
sins were chastised, and the son of Melo, overthrown and wounded, was 
driven from the field to hide his shame behind the walls of Bari, and to 
await the tardy succour of his allies. 

But the power of Constantine was distracted by a Turkish war, the 
mind of Henry was feeble and irresolute, and the pope, instead of re* 
passing the Alps with a German army, was accompanied only by a 
guard of seven hundred Swabians and some volunteers of Lorraine. 
In his long progress from Mantua to Beneventum a vile and promiscu- 
ous multitude of Italians was enlisted under the holy standard ;** the 

Fcederatus et Patriciatus, et Catapani et Vestatus. In his Annals Muratori 
(torn. viii. p. 426) very properly reads, or interprets, Sevestatus, the title of 
Sebastps or Augustus. But in his Antiquities he was taught by Ducange to 
make it a palatine office, master of the wardrobe. 

M A Life of St. Leo IX., deeply tinged with the passions and prejudices 
of the age, has been composed by Wibert, printed at Paris, 1615, in octavo, 
and since inserted in the Collections of the Bollandists, of Mabillon, and of 
Muratori. The public and private history of that pope is diligentiy treated 
by M. de St Marc (AbrSge", torn. ii. p. 140-210, and p. 25-95, second column.)

priest and the robber slept in the same tent, the pikes and crosses were 
intermingled in the front, and the martial saint repeated the lessons of 
his youth in the order of march, of encampment, and of combat. The 
Normans of Apulia could muster in the field no more than three thou- 
sand horse, with a handful of infantry; the defection of the natives in- 
tercepted their provisions and retreat; and their spirit, incapable of 
fear was chilled for a moment by superstitious awe. On the hostile 
approach of Leo, they knelt, without disgrace or reluctance, before 
their spiritual father. But the pope was inexorable; his lofty Germans 
affected to deride the diminutive stature of their adversaries; and the 
Normans were informed that death or exile was their only alternative. 
Flight they disdained, and, as many of them had been three days with- 
out tasting food, they embraced the assurance of a more easy and hon- 
ourable death. They climbed the hill of Civitella, descended into the 
plain and charged in three divisions the army of the pope. On the 
left, and in the centre, Richard count of Aversa, and Robert the fam- 
ous Guiscard, attacked, broke, routed, and pursued the Italian multi- 
tudes, who fought without discipline and fled without shame. A harder 
trial was reserved for the valour of Count Humphrey, who led the cav- 
alry of the right wing. The Germans s * have been described as un- 
skilful in the management of the horse and lance, but on foot they 
formed a strong and impenetrable phalanx, and neither man, nor 
steed, nor armour could resist the weight of their long and two-handed 
swords. After a severe conflict they were encompassed by the squad- 
rons returning from the pursuit, and died in their ranks with the es- 
teem of their foes and the satisfacion of revenge. The gates of Civi- 
tella were shut against the flying pope, and he was overtaken by the 
pious conquerors, who kissed his feet to implore his blessing and the 
absolution of their sinful victory. The soldiers beheld in their enemy 
and captive the vicar of Christ; and, though we may suppose the policy 
of the chiefs, it is probable that they were infected by the popular 
superstition. In the calm of retirement the well-meaning pope deplored 
the effusion of Christian blood which must be imputed to his account; 
he felt that he had been the author of sin and scandal; and, as his 
undertaking had failed, the indecency of his military character was 
universally condemned. 35 With these dispositions he listened to the 

pulus (1. ii. p. 259-261) and Jeffrey Malaterra (1. i. c. 13, 14, 15, p. 253). They 
are impartial, as the national is counterbalanced by the clerical prejudice. 
84 Teutonici, quia csesaries et forma decoros

The verses of the Apulian are commonly in this strain, though he heats 
himself a little in the battle. Two of his similes from hawking and sorcery 
are descriptive of manners. 

"Several respectable censures or complaints are produced by M. de St. 
Marc (torn. ii. p. 200-204). As Peter Damianus, the oracle of the times, had 
denied the popes the right of making war, the hermit (lugens eremi incola) 
is arraigned by the cardinal, and Baronius (Annal. Eccles. A.D. 1053, No. 
10-17) most strenuously asserts the two swords of St Peter.

offers of a beneficial treaty, deserted an alliance which he had preached 
as the cause of God, and ratified the past and future conquests of the 
Normans. By whatever hands they had been usurped, the provinces 
of Apulia and Calabria were a part of the donation of Constantine and 
the patrimony of St. Peter: the grant and the acceptance confirmed 
the mutual claims of the pontiff and the adventurers. They promised 
to support each other with spiritual and temporal arms; a tribute or 
quit-rent of twelve pence was afterwards stipulated for every plough- 
land, and since this memorable transaction the kingdom of Naples has 
remained above seven hundred years a fief of the Holy See. 36 

The pedigree of Robert Guiscard ST is variously deduced from the 
peasants and the dukes of Normandy: from the peasants, by the pride 
and ignorance of a Grecian princess; 38 from the dukes, by the igno- 
rance and flattery of the Italian subjects. 89 His genuine descent may 
be ascribed to the second or middle order of private nobility. 40 He 
sprang from a race of valvassors or bannerets, of the diocese of Cou- 
tances, in the Lower Normandy; the castle of Hauteville was their 
honourable seat; his father Tancred was conspicuous in the court and 
army of the duke, and his military service was furnished by ten sol- 
diers or knights. Two marriages, of a rank not unworthy of his own, 
made him the father of twelve sons, who were educated at home by the 

30 The origin and nature of the papal investitures are ably discussed by 
Giannone (Istoria Civile di Napoli, torn. ii. p. 37-49, 57-66) as a lawyer and 
antiquarian. Yet he vainly strives to reconcile the duties of patriot and 
Catholic, adopts an empty distinction of "Ecclesia Romana non dedit sed 
accepit," and shrinks from an honest but dangerous confession of the truth. 

"The birth, character, and first actions of Robert Guiscard may be found 
in Jeffrey Malaterra (1. i. c. 3, 4, , 16, 17, 18, 38, 39, 40), William Appulus 
(1. ii. p. 260-262), William Gemeticensis or of Jumieges (1. xi. c. 30, p. 663, 
664, edit Camden), and Anna Comnena (Alexiad, 1. i. p. 23-27, 1. vi. p. i6s &gt; 
166 [torn. i. p. 49-56, 293-295, ed. Bonn]), with the annotations of Ducange 
(Not. in Alexiad. p. 230-232, 320), who has swept all the French and Latin 
Chronicles for supplemental intelligence.

89 Giannone (torn. ii. p. 2) forgets all his original authors, and rests this 
princely descent on the credit of Inveges, an Augustine monk of Palermo 
in the last century. They continue the succession of dukes from Rollo to 
William II. the Bastard or Conqueror, whom they hold (communemente si 
tiene) to be the father of Tancred of Hauteville: a most strange and stu- 
pendous blunder I The sons of Tancred fought in Apulia before William IL 
was three years old (A.D. 1037).

postea pervenit; quse honesta tamen et praeter nobilium vulgarium statum et

impartial tenderness of his second wife. But a narrow patrimony was 
insufficient for this numerous and daring progeny; they saw around the 
neighbourhood the mischiefs of poverty and discord, and resolved to 
seek in foreign wars a more glorious inheritance. Two only remained 
to perpetuate the race and cherish their father's age; their ten brothers, 
as they successively attained the vigour of manhood, departed from 
the castle, passed the Alps, and joined the Apulian camp of the Nor- 
mans. The elder were prompted by native spirit: their success en- 
couraged their younger brethren; and the three first in seniority, Wil- 
liam, Drogo, and Humphrey, deserved to be the chiefs of their nation 
and the founders of the new republic. Robert was the eldest of the 
seven sons of the second marriage, and even the reluctant praise of his 
foes has endowed him with the heroic qualities of a soldier and a states- 
man. His lofty stature surpassed the tallest of his army; his limbs 
were cast in the true proportion of strength and gracefulness; and to 
the decline of life he maintained the patient vigour of health and the 
commanding dignity of his form. His complexion was ruddy, his 
shoulders were broad, his hair and beard were long and of a flaxen 
colour, his eyes sparkled with fire, and his voice, like that of Achilles, 
could impress obedience and terror amidst the tumult of battle. Iii 
the ruder ages of chivalry such qualifications are not below the notice 
of the poet or historian; they may observe that Robert, at once, and 
with equal dexterity, could wield in the right hand his sword, his lance 
- in the left; that in the battle of Civitella he was thrice unhorsed, and 
that in the dose of that memorable day he was adjudged to have borne 
away the prize of valour from the warriors of the two armies. 41 His 
boundless ambition was founded on the consciousness of superior worth; 
in the pursuit of greatness he was never arrested by the scruples of 
justice, and seldom moved by the feelings of humanity; though not 
insensible of fame, the choice of open or clandestine means was deter- 
mined only by his present advantage. The surname of Guiscard 42 was 
applied to this master of political wisdom, which is too often con- 
founded with the practice of dissimulation and deceit, and Robert is 
praised by the Apulian poet for excelling the cunning of Ulysses and 

"I shall quote with pleasure some of the best lines of the Apulian (1 ii

the eloquence of Cicero. Yet these arts were disguised by an appear- 
ance of military frankness; in his highest fortune he was accessible 
and courteous to his fellow-soldiers; and while he indulged the preju- 
dices of his new subjects, he affected in his dress and manners to main- 
tain the ancient fashion of his country. He grasped with a rapacious, 
that he might distribute with a liberal, hand; his primitive indigence 
had taught the habits of frugality; the gain of a merchant was not be- 
low^his attention; and his prisoners were tortured with slow and un- 
feeling cruelty to force a discovery of their secret treasure. According 
to the Greeks, he departed from Normandy with only five followers 
on horseback and thirty on foot; yet even this allowance appears too 
bountiful; the sixth son of Tancred of Hauteville passed -the Alps as a 
pilgrim, and his first military band was levied among the adventurers 
of Italy. His brothers and countrymen had divided the fertile lands of 
Apulia, but they guarded their shares with the jealousy of avarice; 
the aspiring youth was driven forwards to the mountains of Calabria, 
and in his first exploits against the Greeks and the natives It is not 
easy to discriminate the hero from the robber. To surprise a castle or 
a convent, to ensnare a wealthy citizen, to plunder the adjacent villages 
for necessary food, were the obscure labours which . formed and exer- 
cised the powers of his mind and body. The volunteers of Normandy 
adhered to his standard, and, under his command, the peasants of 
Calabria assumed the name and character of Normans. 

As .the genius of Robert expanded with his fortune, he awakened the 
jealousy of his elder brother, by whom, in a transient quarrel, his life 
was threatened and his liberty restrained. After the death of Hum- 
phrey the tender age of his sons excluded them from the command; 
they were reduced to a private estate by the ambition of their guardian 
and uncle; and Guiscard was exalted on a buckler, and saluted count 
of Apulia and general of the republic. With an increase of authority 
and of force, he resumed the conquest of Calabria, and soon aspired 
to a rank that should raise him for ever above the heads of his equals. 
By some acts of rapine or sacrilege he had incurred a papal excommuni- 
cation: but Nicholas the Second was easily persuaded that the divi- 
sions of friends could terminate only in their mutual prejudice; that 
the Normans were the faithful champions of the Holy See; and it was. 
safe^r to trust the alliance of a prince than the caprice of an aristocracy. 
A synod of one hundred bishops was convened at Mdphi; and the 
count interrupted an important enterprise to guard the person and exe* 
cute the decrees of the Roman pontiff. His gratitude and policy con- 
ferred on Robert and his posterity the ducal title, 43 with the investi- 
ture of Apulia, Calabria, and all the lands, both in Italy and Sicily, 
which his sword could rescue from the schismatic Greeks and the un* 
believing Saracens.** This apostolic sanction might justify his arms: 

48 The acquisition of the ducal title by Robert Guiscard is a nice and obscure ' 
business. With the good advice of Giannone, Muratori, and St. Marc, I 
have endeavoured to form a consistent and probable narrative. 

"Baronins (Annal. Eccles. A.D. 1059, No. 69) has published the original acfc" : 



3 6o THE DECLINE AND FALL OP 

but the obedience of a free and victorious people could not be 
f erred without their consent; and Guiscard dissembled his elevation 
till the ensuing campaign had been illustrated by the conquest of 
Consenza and Reggio. In the hour of triumph he assembled his troops 
and solicited the Normans to confirm by their suffrage the judgment 
of the vicar of Christ: the soldiers hailed with joyful acclamations their 
valiant duke; and the counts, his former equals, pronounced the oath 
of fidelity with hollow smiles and secret indignation. After this inaugu- 
ration, Robert styled himself, " By the grace of God and St. Peter, duke 
of Apulia, Calabria, and hereafter of Sicily;" and it was the labour 
of twenty years to deserve and realise these lofty appellations. Such 
tardy progress, in a narrow space, may seem unworthy of the abilities 
of the chief and the spirit of the nation: but the Normans were few 
in number; their resources were scanty; their service was voluntary 
and precarious. The bravest designs of the duke were sometimes op- 
posed by the free voice of his parliament of barons: the twelve counts 
of popular election conspired against his authority; and against their 
perfidious uncle the sons of Humphrey demanded justice and revenge. 
By his policy and vigour Guiscard discovered their plots, suppressed 
their rebellions, and punished the guilty with death or exile; but in 
these domestic feuds his years, and the national strength, were un- 
profitably consumed. After the defeat of his foreign enemies, the 
Greeks, Lombards, and Saracens, their broken forces retreated to the 
strong and populous cities of the sea-coast. They excelled in the arts 
of fortification and defence; the Normans were accustomed to serve 
on horseback in the field, and their rude attempts could only succeed 
by the efforts of persevering courage. The resistance of Salerno was 
maintained above eight months: the siege or blockade of Bari lasted 
near four years. In these actions the Norman duke was the foremost 
in every danger, in every fatigue the last and most patient. As he 
pressed the citadel of Salerno a huge stone from the rampart shattered 
one of his military engines, and by a splinter he was wounded in the 
breast. Before the gates of Bari he lodged in a miserable hut or bar- 
rack, composed of dry branches, and thatched with straw a perilous 
station, on all sides open to the inclemency of the winter and the spears 
of the enemy. 45 

The Italian conquests of Robert correspond with the limits of the 
present kingdom of Naples; and the countries united by his arms have 
not been dissevered by the revolutions of seven hundred years. 46 The

a Liber Censuum of the twelfth century has been printed by Muratori (An- 
tiquit niedii JEvi, torn. v. p. 851-908) ; and the names of Vatican and Cardinal 
awaken the suspicions of a Protestant, and even of a philosopher.

monarchy has been composed of the Greek provinces of Calabria and 
Apulia, of the Lombard principality of Salerno, the republic of Amal- 
phi, and the inland dependencies of the large and ancient duchy of 
Beneventum. Three districts only were exempted from the common 
law of subjection the first for ever, and the two last till the middle 
of the succeeding century. The city and immediate territory of Bene- 
vento had been transferred, by gift or exchange, from the German em- 
peror to the Roman pontiff; and although this holy land was some- 
times invaded, the name of St. Peter was finally more potent than the 
sword of the Normans. Their first colony of Aversa subdued and held 
the state of Capua, and her princes were reduced to beg their bread 
before the palace of their fathers. The dukes of Naples, the present 
metropolis, maintained the popular freedom under the shadow of the 
Byzantine empire. Among the new acquisitions of Guiscard the sci- 
ence of Salerno 4T and the trade of Amalphi 4S may detain for a moment 
the curiosity of the reader. I. Of the learned faculties jurisprudence 
implies the previous establishment of laws and property; and theology 
may perhaps be superseded by the full light of religion and reason. 
But the savage and the sage must alike implore the assistance of 
physic; and if our diseases are inflamed by luxury, the mischiefs of 
blows and wounds would be more frequent hi the ruder ages of society. 
The treasures of Grecian medicine had been communicated to the 
Arabian colonies of Africa, Spain, and Sicily; and in the intercourse of 
peace and war a spark of knowledge had been kindled and cherished 
at Salerno, an illustrious city, in which the men were honest and the 
women beautiful. 49 A school, the first that arose in the darkness of 
Europe, was consecrated to the healing art: the conscience of monks 
and bishops was reconciled to that salutary and lucrative profession; 
and a crowd of patients of the most eminent rank and most distant 
climates invited or visited the physicians of Salerno. 50 They were pro-

Frederick II. 

47 Giannone (torn. ii. p. 119-127), Muratori (Antiquitat. medii JEvi, torn. iii.

have given an historical account of these physicians; their medical knowl- 
edge and practice must be left to our physicians. 

At the end of the Historia Pandectarum of Henry Brenckmann (Trajecti 
ad Rhenum, 1722, in 4to) the indefatigable author has inserted two disserta- 
tions de Republics. Amalphitana, and de Amalphi a Pisanis direpta, which 
are built on the testimonies of one hundred and forty writers. Yet he ha 
forgotten two most important passages of the embassy of Liutprand (A.IX

tected by the Norman conquerors; and Guiscard, though bred in arms, 
could discern the merit and value of a philosopher. After a pilgrimage 
of thirty-nine years, Constantine, an African Christian, returned from 
Bagdad, a master of the language and learning of the Arabians; and 
Salerno was enriched by the practice, the lessons, and the writings of 
the pupil of Avicenna. The school of medicine has long slept in the 
name of a university; but her precepts are abridged in a string of 
aphorisms, bound together in the Leonine verses, or Latin rhymes, of 
the twelfth century. 51 II. Seven miles to the west of Salerno, and 
thirty to the south of Naples, the obscure town of Amalphi displayed 
the power and rewards of industry. The land, however fertile, was 
of narrow extent; but the sea was accessible and open: the inhabitants 
first assumed the office of suplying the western world with the manu- 
factures and productions of the East; and this useful traffic was the 
source of their opulence and freedom. The government was popular, 
under the administration of a duke and the supremacy of the Greek 
emperor. Fifty thousand citizens were numbered in the walls, of 
Amalphi; nor was any city more abundantly provided with gold, silver, 
and the objects of precious luxury. The mariners who swarmed in 
her port excelled in the theory and practice of navigation and astron- 
omy; and the discovery of the compass, which has opened the globe, 
is due to their ingenuity or good fortune. Their trade was extended 
to the coasts, or at least 'to the commodities, of Africa, Arabia, and 
India; and their settlements in Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, 
and Alexandria acquired the privileges of independent colonies. 63 After 
three hundred years of prosperity Amalphi was oppressed by the arms 
of the Normans, and sacked by the jealousy of Pisa; but the poverty 
of one thousand fishermen is yet dignified by the remains of an arsenal, 
a cathedral, and the palaces of royal merchants. 
Roger, the twelfth and last of the sons of Tancred, had been long 

in theology and Bologna in law, while throughout the Middle Ages no school 
of medicine except Montpellier rivalled its f arne, it remained without influence 
in the development of academic institutions." O. S.] 

a Muratori carries their antiquity above the year (1066) of tne death of 
Edward the Confessor, the rex Anglorwn to whom they are addressed- Nor 
is this date affected by the opinion, or rather mistake, of Pasquier (Recherches

of the North and East (Muratori, ABtiquitat torn- iii. dissert xl, p. 686-708).

detained in Normandy by his own and his father's age. He accepted 
the welcome summons; hastened to the Apulian camp; and deserved 
at first the esteem, and afterwards the envy, of his elder brother. Their 
valour and ambition were equal; but the youth, the beauty, the ele- 
gant manners, of Roger, engaged the disinterested love of the soldiers 
and people. So scanty was his allowance, for himself and forty fol- 
lowers, that he descended from conquest to robbery, and from robbery 
to domestic theft; and so loose were the notions of property, that, by 
his own historian, at his special command, he is accused of stealing 
horses from a stable at MelphL 53 His spirit emerged from poverty 
and disgrace: from these base practices he rose to the merit and glory 
of a holy war; and the invasion of Sicily was seconded by the zed 
and policy of his brother Guiscard. After the retreat of the Greeks, 
the idolaters, a most audacious reproach of the Catholics, had retrieved 
their losses and possessions; but the deliverance of the island, so 
vainly undertaken by the forces of the Eastern empire, was achieved 
by a small and private band of adventurers. 54 In the first attempt 
Roger braved, in an open boat, the real and fabulous dangers of Scylla 
and Charybdis; landed with only sixty soldiers on a hostile shore; 
drove the Saracens to the gates of Messina; and safely returned with 
the spoils of the adjacent country. In the fortress of Trani his active 
and patient courage were equally conspicuous. In his old age he re- 
lated with pleasure that, by the distress of the siege, himself, and the 
countess his wife, had been reduced to a single cloak or mantle, which 
they wore alternately: that in a sally his horse had been slain, and he 
was dragged away by the Saracens; but that he owed his rescue to 
his good sword, and had retreated with his saddle on his back, lest the 
meanest trophy might be left in the hands of the miscreants. In the 
siege of Trani, three hundred Normans withstood and repulsed the 
forces of the island. In the field of Ceramio fifty thousand horse and 
foot were overthrown by one hundred and thirty-six Christian soldiers, 
without reckoning St. George, who fought on horseback in the fore- 
most ranks. The captive banners, with four camels, were reserved 
for the successor of St. Peter; and had these barbaric spoils been ex- 
posed not in the Vatican, but in the Capitol, they might have revived 
the memory of the Punic triumphs. These insufficient numbers of the

to the horse-stealing. From the moment (1. i. c. 19) that he has mentioned 
his patron Roger, the elder brother sinks into the second character. Some- 
thing similar in Velleius Paterculus may be observed of Augustus and 
Tiberius.

Normans most probably denote their knights, the soldiers of honour- 
able and equestrian rank, each of whom was attended by five or six 
followers in the field; 55 yet, with the aid of this interpretation, and 
after every fair allowance on the side of valour, arms, and reputation, 
the discomfiture of so many myriads will reduce the prudent reader 
to the alternative of a mirade or a fable. The Arabs of Sicily derived 
a frequent and powerful succour from their countrymen of Africa: in 
the siege of Palermo the Norman cavalry was assisted by the galleys 
of Pisa; and, in the hour of action, the envy of the two brothers was 
sublimed to a generous and invincible emulation. After a war of thirty 
years, 60 Roger, with the title of great count, obtained the sovereignty 
of the largest and most fruitful island of the Mediterranean; and his 
administration displays a liberal and enlightened mind above the 
limits of his age and education. The Moslems were maintained in the 
free enjoyment of their religion and property: 57 a philosopher and 
physician of Mazara, of the race of Mohammed, harangued the con- 
queror, and was invited to court; his geography of the seven climates 
was translated into Latin; and Roger, after a diligent perusal, pre- 
ferred the work of the Arabian to the writings of the Grecian Ptolemy. 58 
A remnant of Christian natives had promoted the success of the Nor- 
mans: they were rewarded by the triumph of the cross. The island 
was restored to the jurisdiction of the Roman pontiff; new bishops 
were planted in the principal cities; and the clergy was satisfied by a 
liberal endowment of churches and monasteries. Yet the Catholic hero 
asserted the rights of the civil magistrate. Instead of resigning the 
investiture of benefices, he dexterously applied to his own profit the 
papal daims: the supremacy of the crown was secured and enlarged 
by the singular bull which declares the princes of Sicily hereditary and 
perpetual legates of the Holy See. 59 

25 See the word MiKtes in the Latin Glossary of Ducange. 

"Of odd particulars, I learn from Malaterra that the Arabs had intro- 
duced into Sicily the use of camels (1. ii. c. 33) and of carrier-pigeons (c. 42) 
and that the bite of the tarantula provokes a windy disposition, quae per anutn 
mhoneste crepitando emergit a symptom most ridiculously felt by the whole 
Norman army in their camp near Palermo (c. 36). I shall add an etymology 
not unworthy of the eleventh century: Messana is derived from Messis, the 
place from whence the harvests of the isle were sent in tribute to Rome 
(1. n. c. i).

THE ROMAN EMPIRE 365 

To Robert Guiscard the conquest of Sicily was more glorious than 
beneficial: the possession of Apulia and Calabria was inadequate to 
his ambition; and he resolved to embrace or create the first occasion 
of invading, perhaps of subduing, the Roman empire of the East. 60 
From his first wife, the partner of his humble fortunes, he had been 
divorced under the pretence of consanguinity; and her son Bohemond 
was destined to imitate, rather than to succeed, his illustrious father. 
The second wife of Guiscard was the daughter of the princes of Sa- 
lerno; the Lombards acquiesced in the lineal succession of their son 
Roger; their five daughters were given in honourable nuptials, 61 and 
one of them was betrothed, in a tender age, to Constantine, a beautiful 
youth, the son and heir of the emperor Michael. 02 But the throne of 
Constantinople was shaken by a revolution: the Imperial family of 
Ducas was confined to the palace or the cloister; and Robert deplored 
and resented the disgrace of his daughter and the expulsion of his ally. 
A Greek, who styled himself the father of Constantine, soon appeared 
at Salerno, and related the adventures of his fall and flight That 
unfortunate friend was acknowledged by the duke, and adorned with 
the pomp and titles of Imperial dignity: in his triumphal progress 
through Apulia and Calabria, Michael 63 was saluted with the tears 
and acclamations of the people; and pope Gregory the Seventh ex- 
horted the bishops to preach, and the Catholics to fight, in the pious 
work of his restoration. His conversations with Robert were frequent 
and familiar; and their mutual promises were justified by the valour 
of the Normans and the treasures of the East. Yet this Michael, by 

of this privilege, and the tribunal of the monarchy of Sicily (torn. ii. p. 95- 
102) ; and St. Marc (Abrege, torn. iii. p. 217-301, first column) labours the 
case with the diligence of a Sicilian lawyer. 

* In the first expedition of Robert against the Greeks, I follow Anna Com- 
nena (the first, third, fourth, and fifth books of the Alexiad), William Ap- 
pulus (L iy. and v., p. 270-275), and Jeffrey Malaterra (L iii. c. 13, 14, 24-29, 
39). Their information is contemporary and authentic, but none of them 
were eye-witnesses of the war. 

"One of them was married to Hugh, the son of Azzo, or A.XO, a marquis 
of Lombardy, rich, powerful, and noble (Gulielm. AppuL 1. iii. p. 267) in 
the eleventh century, and whose ancestors in the tenth and ninth are explored 
by the critical industry of Leibnitz and Muratori. From the two elder sons 
of the marquis Azzo are derived the illustrious lines of Brunswick and Este. 
See Muratori, Antichiti Estense. 

69 Anna Comnena somewhat too wantonly praises and bewails that handsome 
boy, who, after the rupture of his barbaric nuptials (L i. p. 23 [torn. i. p. 49, 
ed. Bonn]), was betrothed as her husband; he was &amp;ya\/ia ipfocus . . . eoO

the confession of the Greeks and Latins, was a pageant and an im- 
postor; a monk who had fled from his convent, or a domestic who had 
served in the palace. The fraud had been contrived by the subtle 
Guiscard; and he trusted that, after this pretender had given a decent 
colour to his arms, he would sink, at the nod of the conqueror, into his 
primitive obscurity. But victory was the only argument that could 
determine the belief of the Greeks; and the ardour of the Latins was 
much inferior to their credulity: the Norman veterans wished to enjoy 
the harvest of their toils, and the unwarlike Italians trembled at the 
known and unknown dangers of a transmarine expedition. In his new 
levies Robert exerted the influence of gifts and promises, the terrors 
of civil and ecclesiastical authority; and some acts of violence might 
justify the reproach that age and infancy were pressed without distinc- 
tion into the service of their unrelenting prince. After two years' in- 
cessant preparations the land and naval forces were assembled at 
Otranto, at the heel, or extreme promontory, of Italy; and Robert was 
accompanied by his wife, who fought by his side, his son Bohemond, 
and' the representative of the emperor Michael. Thirteen hundred 
knights 6 * of Norman race or discipline formed the sinews of the army, 
which might be swelled to thirty thousand 65 followers of every de- 
nomination. The men, the horses, the arms, the engines, the wooden 
towers covered with raw hides, were embarked on board one hundred 
and fifty vessels: the transports had been built in the ports of Italy, 
'and the galleys were supplied by the alliance of the republic of Ragusa. 
At the mouth of the Adriatic Gulf the shores of Italy and Epirus 
incline towards each other. . The space between Brundusium and Du- 
razzo, the Roman passage, is no more than one hundred miles; 06 at 
the last station of Otranto it is contracted to fifty; 67 and this narrow 
distance had suggested to Pyrrhus and Pompey the sublime or extrava- 
gant idea of a bridge. Before the general embarkation the Norman 
duke despatched Bohemond with fifteen galleys to seize or threaten

the isle of Corfu, to survey the opposite coast, and to secure a harbour 
in the neighbourhood of Vallona for the landing of the troops. They 
passed and landed without perceiving an enemy; and this successful 
experiment displayed the neglect and decay of the naval power of the'' 
Greeks. The islands of Epirus and the maritime towns were subdued 
by the arms of the name of Robert, who led his fleet and army from 
Corfu (I use the modern appellation) to the siege of Durazzo. That 
city, the western key of the empire, was guarded by ancient^ renown 
and recent fortifications, by George Palaeologus, a patrician, victorious 
in the Oriental wars, and a numerous garrison of Albanians and Mace- 
donians, who, in every age, have maintained the character of soldiers. 
In the prosecution of his enterprise the courage of Guiscard was as- 
sailed by every form of danger and mischance. In the most pro- 
pitious season of the year, as his fleet passed along the coast, a storm 
of wind and snow unexpectedly arose: the Adriatic was swelled by the 
raging blast of the south, and a new shipwreck confirmed the old in- 
famy of the Acroceraunian rocks. 68 The sails, the masts, and the oars 
were shattered or torn away; the sea and shore were corered with the 
fragments of vessels, with arms and dead bodies; and the greatest part 
of the provisions were either drowned or damaged. The ducal galley 
was laboriously rescued from tie waves, and Robert halted seven days 
on the adjacent cape to collect the relics of his loss and revive the 
drooping spirits of his soldiers. The Normans were no longer the bold 
and experienced mariners who had explored the ocean from Greenland 
to Mount Atlas, and who smiled at the petty dangers of the Mediter- 
ranean. They had wept during the tempest; they were alarmed by the 
hostile approach of the Venetians, who had been solicited by the 
prayers- and promises of the Byzantine court. 'The first day's action 
was not disadvantageous to Bohemond, a beardless youth, 6 * who led 
the naval powers of his father. All night the galleys of the republic 
lay on their anchors in the form of a crescent; and the victory of the 
second day was decided by the dexterity of their 'evolutions, the sta- 
tion of their archers, the weight of their javelins, and the borrowed 
aid of the Greek fire. The Apulian and Ragusian vessels fled to the 
shore, several were cut from their cables and dragged away by the 
conqueror; and a sally from the town carried slaughter and dismay 
to the tents of the Norman duke. A seasonable relief was poured into 
Durazzo, and, as soon as the besiegers had lost the command of the 
sea, the islands and maritime towns withdrew from the camp the supply 
of tribute and provision. That camp was soon afflicted with a pesti-

lential disease: five hundred knights perished by an inglorious death; 
and the list of burials (if all could obtain a decent burial) amounted 
to ten thousand persons. Under these calamities the mind of Guiscard 
alone was firm and invincible; and while he collected new forces from 
Apulia and Sicily, he battered, or scaled, or sapped, the walls of 
Durazzo. But his industry and valour were encountered by equal 
valour and more perfect industry. A movable turret, of a size and 
capacity to contain five hundred soldiers, had been rolled forwards to 
the foot of the rampart: but the descent of the door or drawbridge was 
checked by an enormous beam, and the wooden structure was instantly 
consumed by artificial flames. 

While the Roman empire was attacked by the Turks in the East, and 
the Normans in the West, the aged successor of Michael surrendered 
the sceptre to the hands of Alexius, an illustrious captain, and the 
founder of the Comnenian dynasty. The princess Anne, his daughter 
and historian, observes, in her affected style, that even Hercules was 
unequal to a double combat; and, on this principle, she approves a 
hasty peace with the Turks, which allowed her father to undertake in 
person the relief of Durazzo. On his accession, Alexius found the camp 
without soldiers, and the treasury without money; yet such were the 
vigour and activity of his measures, that in six months he assembled 
an army of seventy thousand men, 70 and performed a march of five 
hundred miles. His troops were levied in Europe and Asia, from 
Peloponnesus to the Black Sea; his majesty was displayed in the silver 
arms and rich trappings of the companies of horse-guards; and the 
emperor was attended by a train of nobles and princes, some of whom, 
in rapid succession, had been clothed with the purple, and were in- 
dulged by the lenity of the times in a life of affluence and dignity: Their 
youthful ardour might animate the multitude; but their love of pleas- 
ure and contempt of subordination were pregnant with disorder and 
mischief; and their importunate clamours for speedy and decisive ac- 
tion disconcerted the prudence of Alexius, who might have surrounded 
and starved the besieging army. The enumeration of provinces recalls 
a sad comparison of the past and present limits of the Roman world: 
the raw levies were drawn together in haste and terror; and the garri- 
sons of Anatolia, or Asia Minor, had been purchased by the evacua- 
tion of the cities which were immediately occupied by the Turks. The 
strength of the Greek army consisted in the Varangians, the Scandi- 
navian guards, whose numbers were recently augmented by a colony 
of exiles and volunteers from the British island of Thule. Under the 

70 Muratori (Annali d'ltalia, torn. ix. p. 136, 137) observes that some authors . 
&lt;Petrus Diacon. Chron. Casinen. 1. iii. c. 49) compose the Greek army of 
170,000 men, but that the hundred may be struck off, and that Malaterra 
reckons only 70,000: a slight inattention. The passage to which he alludes 
is in the Chronicle of Lupus Protospata (Script. Ital. torn. v. p. 45). Mala- 
terra (1. iii. c. 27) speaks in high but indefinite terms of the emperor, cum 
copiis insumerabilibus : like the Apulian poet (1. iv. p. 272) :

yoke of the Norman conqueror, the Danes and English were oppressed 
and united; a band of adventurous youths resolved to desert a land 
of ^slavery; the sea was open to their escape; and, in their long pil- 
grimage, they visited every coast that afforded any hope of liberty and 
revenge^ They were entertained in the service of the Greek emperor; 
and their first station was in a new city on the Asiatic shore: but 
Alexius soon recalled them to the defence of his person and palace; 
and bequeathed to his successors the inheritance of their faith and 
valour. 71 The name of a Norman invader revived the memory of their 
wrongs: they marched with alacrity against the national foe, and 
panted to regain in Epirus the glory which they had lost in the battle 
of Hastings. The Varangians were supported by some companies of 
Franks or Latins; and the rebels who had fled to Constantinople from 
the tyranny of Guiscard were eager to signalise their zeal and gratify 
their revenge. In this emergency the emperor had not disdained the 
impure aid of the Paulicians or Manichseans of Thrace and Bulgaria; 
and these heretics united with the patience of martyrdom the spirit 
and discipline of active valour. 72 The treaty with the sultan had pro- 
cured a supply of some thousand Turks; and the arrows of the Scyth- 
ian horse were opposed to the lances of the Norman cavalry. On the 
report and distant prospect of these formidable numbers, Robert as- 
sembled a council of his principal officers. " You behold," said he, 
" your danger: it is urgent and inevitable. The hills are covered with 
arms and standards; and the emperor of the Greeks is accustomed to 
wars and triumphs. Obedience and union are our only safety; and I 
am ready to yield the command to a more worthy leader." The vote 
and acclamation, even of his secret enemies, assured him, in that peril- 
ous moment, of their esteem and confidence; and the duke thus con- 
tinued: " Let us trust in the rewards of victory, and deprive cowardice 
of the means of escape. Let us burn our vessels and our baggage, and 
give battle on this spot, as if it were the place of our nativity and our 
burial." The resolution was unanimously approved; and, without con- 
fining himself to his lines, Guiscard awaited in battle-array the nearer 
approach of the enemy. His rear was covered by a small river; his 
right wing extended to the sea; his left to the hills: nor was he con- 
scious, perhaps, that on the same ground Caesar and Pompey had for- 
merly disputed the empire of the world. 78 
Against the advice of his wisest captains, Alexius resolved to risk

the event of a general action, and exhorted the garrison of Durazzo to 
assist their own deliverance by a well-timed sally from the town. He 
marched in two columns to surprise the Normans before daybreak on 
two different sides: his light cavalry was scattered over the plain; the 
archers formed the second line; and the Varangians claimed the hon- 
ours of the vanguard. In the first onset the battle-axes of the strangers 
made a deep and bloody impression on the army of Guiscard, which 
was now reduced to fifteen thousand men. The Lombards and Cala- 
brians ignominiously turned their backs; they fled towards the river 
and the sea; but the bridge had been broken down to check the sally 
of the garrison, and the coast was lined with the Venetian galleys, who 
played their engines among the disorderly throng. On the verge of 
rain, they were saved by the spirit and conduct of their chiefs. Gaita, 
the wife of Robert, is painted by the Greeks as a warlike Amazon, a 
second Pallas; less skilful in arts, but not less terrible in arms, than 
the Athenian goddess: 74 though wounded by an arrow, she stood her 
ground, and strove, by her exhortation and example, to rally the flying 
troops. 75 Her female voice was seconded by the more powerful voice 
and arm of the Norman duke, as calm in action as he was magnani- 
mous in council: " Whither," he cried aloud, " whither do ye fly? Your 
enemy is implacable; and death is less grievous than servitude." The 
moment was decisive: as the Varangians advanced before the line, they 
discovered the nakedness of their flanks: the main battle of the duke, 
of eight hundred knights, stood firm and entire; they couched their 
lances, and the Greeks deplore the furious and irresistible shock of the 
French cavalry. 76 Alexius was not deficient in the duties of a soldier 
or a general; but he no sooner beheld the slaughter of the Varangians, 
and the flight of the Turks, than he despised his subjects, and despaired 
of his fortune. The princess Anne, who drops a tear on this melan-

choly event, is reduced to praise the strength and swiftness of her 
father's horse, and his vigorous struggle when he was almost over- 
thrown by the stroke of a lance which had shivered the Imperial helmet. 
His desperate valour broke through a squadron of Franks who op- 
posed his flight; and after wandering two days and as many nights in 
the mountains, he found some repose, of body, though not of mind, in 
the walls of Lychnidus. The victorious Robert reproached the tardy 
and feeble pursuit which had suffered the escape of so illustrious a 
prize: but he consoled his disappointment by the trophies and stand' 
ards of the field, the wealth and luxury of the Byzantine camp, and the 
glory of defeating an army five times more numerous than his own. 
A multitude of Italians had been the victims of their own fears; but 
only thirty of his knights were slain in this memorable day. In the 
Roman host, the loss of Greeks, Turks, and English amounted to five 
or six thousand: 77 the plain of Durazzo was stained with noble and 
royal blood; and the end of the impostor Michael was more honour* 
able than his life. 

It is more than probable that Guiscard was not afflicted by the loss 
of a costly pageant, which had merited only the contempt and derision 
of the Greeks. After their defeat they still persevered in the defence 
of Durazzo; and a Venetian commander supplied the place of George 
Palaeologus, who had been imprudently called away from his station* 
The tents of the besiegers were converted into barracks, to sustain the 
inclemency of the winter; and in answer to the defiance of the garrison, 
Robert insinuated that his patience was at least equal to their ob- 
stinacy. 78 Perhaps he already trusted to his secret correspondence 
with a Venetian noble, who sold the city for a rich and honourable 
marriage. At the dead of night several rope-ladders were dropped 
from the walls; the light Calabrians ascended in silence; and the 
Greeks were awakened by the name and trumpets of the conqueror. 
Yet they defended the streets three days against an enemy already mas- 
ter of the rampart; and near seven months elapsed between the first 
investment and the final surrender of the place. From Durazzo the 
Norman duke advanced. into the heart of Epirus or Albania; traversed 
the first mountains of Thessaly ; surprised three hundred English in the 
city of Castoria; approached Thessalonica; and made Constantinople 
tremble. A more pressing duty suspended the prosecution of his 
ambitious designs. By shipwreck, pestilence, and the sword, his army 
was reduced to a third of the original numbers; and instead of being

might with so little trouble have slain two or three myriads of schismatics 
and infidels! 

n The Romans had changed the inauspicious name of Epi-damnus to 
Dyrrachium (Plin. iii. 26) ; and the vulgar corruption of Duracium (see 
Malaterra) bore some affinity to hardness. One of Robert's names was

recruited from Italy, he was informed, by plaintive epistles, of the 
mischiefs and dangers which had been produced by his absence: the 
revolt of the cities and barons of Apulia; the distress of the pope; and 
the approach or invasion of Henry king of Germany. Highly presum- 
ing that his person was sufficient for the public safety, he repassed the 
sea in a single brigantine, and left the remains of the army under the 
command of his son and the Norman counts, exhorting Bohemond 
to respect the freedom of his peers, and the counts to obey the author- ' 
ity of their leader. The son of Guiscard trod in the footsteps of his 
father; and the two destroyers are compared by the Greeks to the 
caterpillar and the locust, the last of whom devours whatever has 
escaped the teeth of the former. 79 After winning two battles against 
the emperor, he descended into the plain of Thessaly, and besieged La- 
rissa, the fabulous realm of Achilles, 80 which contained the treasure 
and magazines of the Byzantine camp. Yet a just praise must not be 
refused to the fortitude and prudence of Alexius, who bravely struggled 
with the calamities of the times. In the poverty of the state, he pre- 
sumed to borrow the superfluous ornaments of the churches: the deser- 
tion of the Manichaeans was supplied by some tribes of Moldavia: a 
reinforcement of seven thousand Turks replaced and revenged the loss 
of their brethren; and the Greek soldiers were exercised to ride, to 
draw the bow, and to the daily practice of ambuscades and evolutions. 
Alexius had been taught by experience that the formidable cavalry of 
the Franks on foot was unfit for action, and almost incapable of mo- 
tion; 81 his archers were directed to aim their arrows at the horse rather 
than the man; and a variety of spikes and snares were scattered over 
the ground on which he might expect an attack. In the neighbourhood 
of Larissa the events of war were protracted and balanced. The cour- 
age of Bohemond was always conspicuous, and often successful; but 
his camp was pillaged by a stratagem of the Greeks; the city was im- 
pregnable; and the venal or 'discontented counts deserted his standard, 
betrayed their trusts, and enlisted in the service of the emperor. Alexius 
returned to Constantinople with the advantage, rather than the honour, 
of victory. After evacuating the conquests which he could no longer

the little noxious animal, a conqueror. Most unfortunately, the common 
cense, or common nonsense, of mankind, resists her laudable design.

justified by the geography of Homer.

fifteenth century* These peaks, in the form of a scorpion, were sometimes

defend, the son of Guiscard embarked for Italy, and was embraced by 
a father who esteemed his merit, and sympathised in his misfortune. 

Of the Latin princes, the allies of Alexius and enemies of Robert, 
the most prompt and powerful was Henry the Third or Fourth, king 
of Germany and Italy, and future emperor of the West. The epistle 
of the Greek monarch 82 to his brother is filled with the warmest pro- 
fessions of friendship, and the most lively desire of strengthening their 
alliance by every public and private tie. He congratulates Henry on 
his success in a just and pious war, and complains that the prosperity 
of his own empire is disturbed by the audacious enterprises of the 
Norman Robert. The list of his presents expresses the manners of the 
age a radiated crown of gold, a cross set with pearls to hang on the 
breast, a case of relics with the names and titles of the saints, a vase 
of crystal, a vase of sardonyx, some balm, most probably of Mecca, and 
one hundred, pieces of purple. To these he added a more solid present, 
of one hundred and forty-four thousand Byzantines of gold, with a 
farther assurance of two hundred and sixteen thousand, so soon as 
Henry should have entered in arms the Apulian territories, and con- 
firmed by an oath the league against the common enemy. The Ger- 
man, 83 who was already in Lombardy at the head of an army and a 
faction, accepted these liberal offers, and marched towards the south: 
his speed was checked by the sound of the battle of Durazzo; but the 
influence of his arms, or name, in the hasty return of Robert, was a full 
equivalent for the Grecian bribe. Henry was the sincere adversary of 
the Normans, the allies and vassals of Gregory the Seventh, his im- 
placable foe. The long quarrel of the throne and mitre had been re- 
cently kindled by the zeal and ambition of that haughty priest: 8 * the 
king and the pope had degraded each other; and each had seated a rival 
on the temporal or spiritual throne of his antagonist. After the defeat 

"The epistle itself (Alexias, L iii. p. 93, 94, 95 [torn. i. p. 174-177, ed.

Baronius, Muratori, Mosheim, St. Marc, etc. 

"The lives of Gregory VII. are either legends or invectives (St. Marc, 
Abrege, torn. iii. p. 235, etc.) ; and his miraculous or magical performances 
are alike incredible to a modern reader. He will, as usual, find some instruc- 
tion in Le Clerc (Vie de Hildebrand, Biblipth. ancienne et moderne, torn, viii.), 
and much amusement in Bayle (Dictionnaire Critique, Grtgoire VII.). 
That pope was undoubtedly a great man, a second Athanasius, in a more 
fortunate age of the church. Slay I presume to add that the portrait of 
Athanasius is one of the passages of my history (vol. i. p. 697, seq.) with 
which I am the least dissatisfied?

and death of his Swabian rebel, Henry descended into Italy, to assume 
the Imperial crown, and to drive from the Vatican the tyrant of the 
church. 85 But the Roman people adhered to the cause of Gregory: 
their resolution was fortified by supplies of men and money from Apulia; 
and the city was thrice ineffectually besieged by the king of Germany. 
In the fourth year he corrupted, as it is said, with Byzantine gold, the 
nobles of Rome, whose estates and castles had been ruined by the war, 
The gates, the bridges, and fifty hostages were delivered into his hands: 
the anti-pope, Clement the Third, was consecrated in the Lateran: the 
grateful pontiff crowned his protector in the Vatican; and the emperor 
Henry fixed his residence in the Capitol, as the lawful successor ot 
Augustus and Charlemagne. The ruins of the Septizonium were still 
defended by the nephew of Gregory: the pope himself was invested in 
the castle of St. Angelo; and his last hope was in the courage and fidelity 
of his Norman vassal. Their friendship had been interrupted by some 
reciprocal injuries and complaints; but, on this pressing occasion, Guis- 
card was urged by the obligation of his oath, by his interest, mor* 
potent than oaths, by the love of fame, and his enmity to the two 
emperors. Unfurling the holy banner, he resolved to fly to the relief 
of the prince of the apostles: the most numerous of his armies, six thou- 
sand horse and thirty thousand foot, was instantly assembled; and his 
march from Salerno to Rome was animated by the public applause and 
the promise of the divine favour. Henry, invincible in sixty-six battles, 
trembled at his approach; recollected some indispensable affairs that 
required his presence in Lombardy; exhorted the Romans to persevere 
in their allegiance; and hastily retreated three days before the entrance 
of the Normans, In less than three years the son of Tancred of Haute* 
ville enjoyed the glory of delivering the pope, and of compelling the 
two emperors, of the East and West, to fly before his victorious arms. 86 
But the triumph of Robert was clouded by the calamities of Rome. 
By the aid of the friends of Gregory the walls had been perforated or 
scaled; but the Imperial faction was still powerful and active; on the 
third day the people rose in a furious tumult; and a hasty word of the 
conqueror, in his defence or revenge, was the signal of fire and pillage. 87 



8 Anna, with the rancour of a Greek schismatic, calls him 
oy lid* (L L p. 32 [torn. L p. 66, ed. Bonn]), a pope, or priest, worthy to 
be spit, upon; and 'accuses him of scourging, shaving, and perhaps of 
castrating, the ambassadors of Henry (p. 31, 33). But this outrage is 
improbable and doubtful (see the sensible preface of Cousin).

Sunt terrse Domini duo: rex Alemannicus iste,

It is singular enough, that the Apulian, a Latin, should distinguish the 
Greek as .the ruler of the Roman empire (L iv. p. 274). 

The narrative of Malaterra/L iii. c. 37, p. 587, 588) is authentic, cir- 
cumstantial, and fair. Dux ignem exclamans urbe incensa etc The 
Apulian softens the mischief (inde qttibusdam sedibus exustis), w'hich is 
again exaggerated in some partial chronicles ,(Muratori Annali, torn. ix. p. 147) 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 375 

The Saracens of Sicily, the subjects of Roger, and auxiliaries of his 
brother, embraced this fair occasion of rifling and profaning the holy 
city of the Christians; many thousands of the citizens, in the sight and 
by the allies of their spiritual father, were exposed to violation, cap- 
tivity, or death; and a spacious quarter of the city, from the Lateran 
to the Coliseum, was consumed by the flames, and devoted to perpetual 
solitude. 88 From a city where he was now hated, and might be no 
longer feared, Gregory retired to end his days in the palace of Salerno. 
The artful pontiff might flatter the vanity of Guiscard with the hope 
of a Roman or Imperial crown; but this dangerous measure, which would 
have inflamed the ambition of the Norman, must for ever have alienated 
the most faithful princes of Germany. 

The deliverer and scourge of Rome might have indulged himself in 
a season of repose; but in the same year of the flight of the German 
emperor the indefatigable Robert resumed the design of his Eastern 
conquests. The zeal or gratitude of Gregory had promised to his valour 
the kingdoms of Greece and Asia; 89 his troops were assembled in arms, 
flushed with success, and eager for action. Their numbers, in the 
language of Homer, are compared by Anna to a swarm of bees;* yet 
the utmost and moderate limits of the powers of Guiscard have been 
already defined: they were contained hi this second occasion in one 
hundred and twenty vessels, and, as the season was far advanced, the 
harbour of Brundusium 81 was preferred to the open road of Otranto, 
Alexius, apprehensive of a second attack, had assiduously laboured to 
restore the naval forces of the empire, and obtained from the republic 
of Venice an important succour of thirty-six transports, fourteen gal- 
leys, and nine galeots or ships of extraordinary strength and magnitude. 
Their services were liberally paid by the licence or monopoly of trade, 

88 After mentioning this devastation, the Jesuit Donatus (de Roma veteri 
et nova, 1. iv. c. 8, p. 489) prettily adds, Duraret hodieque in Ccelio monte, 
interque ipsum et capitolium, miserabilis fades prostrate urbis, nisi in 
hortorum vinetorumque amcenitatem Roma resurrexisset, tit pe&lt;petua 
viriditate contegeret vulnera et ruinas suas. 

89 The royalty of Robert, either promised or bestowed by the pop* (Anna, 
1. i. p. 32 [torn. L p. 65, ed. Bonn]), is sufficiently confirmed by the A.pulian 
(L iv. p. 270). f m

Nor can I understand why Gretser and the other^ papal aovocetes should be 
displeased with this new instance of apostolic jurisdiction. 

*See Homer, Iliad B (I hate this pedantic mode of quotation by the 
letters of the Greek alphabet), 87, etc. His bees are the image of a dis- 
orderly crowd ; their discipline and public works seem to be the ideas of a 
later age (Virgil. JEneid. 1. i. [v. 430, sqq.]). 

^Gulielm. Appulus, 1. v. p. 276. The admirable port of Brundusium 
was double; the outward harbour was a gulf covered by an island, and 
narrowing by degrees, till it communicated by a small gullet with the inner 
harbour, which embraced the city on both sides. Caesar and nature have 
laboured for its ruin; and against such agents what are the feeble efforts of 
the Neapolitan government? (Swinburne's Travels in the Two Sicilies 
vol. i. p. 384-390.) 



376 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

a profitable gift of many shops and houses in the port of Constantinople, 
and a tribute to St. Mark, the more acceptable, as it was the produce 
of a tax on their rivals of Amalphi. By the union of the Greeks and 
Venetians the Adriatic was covered with a hostile fleet; but their own 
neglect, or the vigilance of Robert, the change of a wind, or the shelter 
of a mist, opened a free passage, and the Norman troops were safely 
disembarked on the coast of Epirus. With twenty strong and well- 
appointed galleys their intrepid duke immediately sought the enemy, 
and, though more accustomed to fight on horseback, he trusted his own 
life, and the lives of his brother and two sons, to the event of a naval 
combat. The dominion of the sea was disputed in three engagements, 
in sight of the isle of Corfu; in the two former the skill and numbers 
of the allies were superior; but in the third the Normans obtained a 
final and complete victory. 02 The light brigantines of the Greeks were 
scattered in ignominious flight; the nine castles of the Venetians main- 
tained a more obstinate conflict: seven were sunk, two were taken; two 
thousand five hundred captives implored in vain the mercy of the vic- 
tor; and the daughter of Alexius deplores the loss of thirteen thousand 
of his subjects or allies. The want of experience had been supplied by 
the genius of Guiscard; and each evening, when he had sounded a 
retreat, he calmly explored the causes of his repulse, and invented new 
methods how to remedy his own defects and to baffle the advantages 
of the enemy. The winter season suspended his progress; with the 
return of spring he again aspired to the conquest of Constantinople; 
but, instead of traversing the hills of Epirus, he turned his arms against 
Greece and the islands, where the spoils would repay the labour, and 
where the land and sea forces might pursue their joint operations with 
vigour and effect. But in the isle of Cephalonia his projects were fatally 
blasted by an epidemical disease: Robert himself, in the seventieth 
year of his age, expired in his tent, and a suspicion of poison was im- 
puted, by public rumour, to his wife, or to the Greek emperor. 08 This 

"William of Apulia (1. y. p. 276) describes the victory of the Normans, 
and forgets the two previous defeats, which are diligently recorded by 
Anna Coninena (1. vi. p. 159, 160, 161 [p. 282-285, ed. Bonn]). In her 
turn, she invents or magnifies a fourth action, to give the Venetians revenge 
and rewards. Their own feelings were far different, since they deposed 
their doge, propter excidium stoli (Dandulus in Chron. in Muratori, Script 
Rerum Italicarum, torn. xii. p. 249). 

"The most authentic writers, William of Apulia (1. v. 277), Jeffrey Mala- 
terra (1. iii. c. 41, p. 589), ^and Romuald of Salerno (Chron. in Muratori, 
Script Rerum Ital. torn, vii.), are ignorant of this crime, so apparent to 
our countrymen William of Malmesbury (1. iii. p. 107) and Roger de Hove- 
den (p. 710, in Script, post Bedam) ; and the latter can tell how the just 
Alexius inarried, crowned, and burnt alive, his female accomplice. The 
English historian is indeed so blind, that he ranks Robert Guiscard or 
Wiscard, among the knights of Henry I., who ascended the throne fifteen 
years after the duke of Apulia's death. 

[Robert Guiscard when he died was just on the eve of sailing to Cepha- 
lonia. He died in his winter quarters at Bundicia near the mouth of the 
river Glykys, on the shores of Epirus. 0. S.] 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 3?7 

premature death might allow a boundless scope for the imagination of 
his future exploits, and the event sufficiently declares that the Norman 
greatness was founded on his life. 9 * Without the appearance of an 
enemy ^a victorious army dispersed or retreated in disorder and con- 
sternation, and Alexius, who had trembled for his empire, rejoiced in 
his deliverance. The galley which transported the remains of Guis- 
card was shipwrecked on the Italian shore, but the duke's body was 
recovered from the sea, and deposited in the sepulchre of Venusia, 05 a 
place more illustrious for the birth of Horace $e than for the burial of 
the Norman heroes. Roger, his second son and successor, immediately 
sunk to the humble station of a duke of Apulia; the esteem or partiality 
of his father left the valiant Bohemond to the inheritance of his sword. 
The national tranquillity was disturbed by his daims, till the first cru- 
sade against the infidels of the East opened a more splendid field of 
glory and conquest. 97 

Of human life the most glorious or humble prospects are alike and 
soon bounded by the sepulchre. The male line of Robert Guiscard was 
extinguished, both hi Apulia and at Antioch, in the second generation; 
but his younger brother became the father of a line of kings; and the 
.son of the great count was endowed with the name, the conquests, and 
the spirit of the first Roger. 98 The heir of that Norman adventurer was 
born in Sicily, and at the age of only four years he succeeded to the sov- 
ereignty of the island, a lot which reason might envy could she indulge 
for a moment the visionary, though virtuous, wish of dominion. Had 
Roger been content with his fruitful patrimony, a happy and grateful 
people might have blessed their benefactor; and if a wise administration 
could have restored the prosperous times of the Greek colonies," the

his best praise is the esteem and envy of William the Conqueror, the 
sovereign of his family. Grsecia (says Malaterra) hostibus recedentibus

Malmesbury (1. iii. p. 107) inserts an epitaph on Guiscard, which is not 
worth transcribing. 

w Yet Horace had few obligations to Venusia: he was carried to Rome 
in his childhood ( Serm. i. 6 [ v. 76] ) ; and his repeated allusions to the 
doubtful limit of Apulia and Lucania (Carm. iii. 4; Serm. ii. i [v. 34, sqq.]) 
are unworthy of his age and genius.

the Istoria Civile of Giannone (torn. ii. 1. xi.-xiv. p. 136-340), and is spread 
over the ninth and tenth volumes of the ItaEan Annals of Muratori. In 
the Bibliotheque Italique (torn. i. p. 175-222) I find a useful abstract of 
Capecelatro, a modern Neapolitan, who has composed, in two volumes, 
the history of his country from Roger I. to Frederic II. inclusive.

378 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

opulence and power of Sicily alone might have equalled the widest 
scope that could be acquired and desolated by the sword of war. But 
the ambition of the great count was ignorant of these noble pursuits; 
it was gratified by the vulgar means of violence and artifice. He sought 
to obtain the undivided possession of Palermo, of which one moiety had 
been ceded to the elder branch; struggled to enlarge his Calabrian 
limits beyond the measure of former treaties; and impatiently watched 
the declining health of his cousin William of Apulia, the grandson of 
Robert. On the first intelligence of his premature death, Roger sailed 
from Palermo with seven galleys, cast anchor in the bay of Salerno, 
received, after ten days' negotiation, an oath of fidelity from the Nor- 
man capital, commanded the submission of the barons, and extorted a 
legal investiture from the reluctant popes, who could not long endure 
either the friendship or enmity of a powerful vassal. The sacred spot 
of Benevento was respectfully spared, as the patrimony of St. Peter; 
but the reduction of Capua and Naples completed the design of his 
uncle Guiscard; and the sole inheritance of the Norman conquests was 
possessed by the victorious Roger. A conscious superiority of power 
and merit prompted him to disdain the titles of duke and of count; 
and the isle of Sicily, with a third perhaps of the continent of Italy, 
might form the basis of a kingdom 10 which would only yield to the 
monarchies of France and England. The chiefs of the nation who 
attended his coronation at Palermo might doubtless pronounce under 
what name he should reign over them; but the example of a Greek 
tyrant or a Saracen emir TOere insufficient to justify his regal character; 
and the nine kings of the lathi world 101 might disclaim their new asso- 
ciate unless he were consecrated by the authority of the supreme pontiff. 
The pride of Anacletus was pleased to confer a title which the pride of 
the Norman had stooped to solicit; 102 but his own legitimacy was at- 
tacked by the adverse election of Innocent the Second; and while Ana- 
cletus sat in the Vatican, the successful fugitive was acknowledged by 
the nations of Europe. The infant monarchy of Roger was shaken, 

and his adversary Wallace (Numbers of Mankind, p. 306, 307). The ruins 
of Agrigentum are the theme of every traveller, D'Orville, Reidesel, Swin- 
burne, etc. 

**A contemporary historian of the acts of Roger from the year 1127 to 
1135 founds his title on merit and power, the consent of the barons, and 
the ancient royalty of Sicily and Palermo, without introducing pope Anacletus 
(Alexand. Ccenobii Telesini Abbatis de Rebus Gestis Regis Rogerii, lib. iv. in 
Muratori, Script. Rerum ItaJ. torn. v. p. 607-645).

Sweden, Denmark, and Hungary. The three first were more ancient than 
Charlemagne; the three next were created by their sword; the three last 
by their baptism; and of these the king of Hungary alone was honoured 
or debased by a papal crown. 

"^Fazellus and a crowd of Sicilians had imagined a more early and inde- 
pendent^ coronation (AD. 1130, May i), which Giannone unwillingly rejects

and almost overthrown, by the unlucky choice of an ecclesiastical 
patron; and the sword of Lothaire the Second of Germany, the excom- 
munications of Innocent, the fleets of Pisa, and the zeal of St. Bernard, 
were united for the ruin of the Sicilian robber. After a gallant resist- 
ance the Norman prince was driven from the continent of Italy: a new 
duke of Apulia was invested by the pope and the emperor, each of 
whom held one end of the gonjanor, or flagstaff, as a token that they 
asserted their right, and suspended their quarrel. But such jealous 
friendship was of short and precarious duration: the German armies 
soon vanished in disease and desertion: 103 the Apulian duke, with all 
his adherents was exterminated by a conqueror who seldom forgave 
either the dead or the living; like his predecessor Leo the Ninth, the 
feeble though haughty pontiff became the captive and friend of the 
Normans; and their reconciliation was celebrated by the eloquence of 
Bernard, who now revered the title and virtues of the king of Sicily. 
As a penance for his impious war against the successor of St. Peter, 
that monarch might have promised to display the banner of the cross, 
and he accomplished with ardour a vow so propitious to his interest and 
revenge. The recent injuries of Sicily might provoke a just retaliation 
on the heads of the Saracens: the Normans, whose blood had been min- 
gled with so many subject streams, were encouraged to remember and 
emulate the naval trophies of their fathers, and in the maturity of their 
strength they contended with the decline of an African power. When 
the Fatimite caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt, he rewarded 
the real merit and apparent fidelity of his servant Joseph with a gift of 
his royal mantle, and forty Arabian horses, his palace, with its sumptu- 
ous furniture, and the government of the kingdoms of Tunis and Al- 
giers. The Zeirides, 104 the descendants of Joseph, forgot their allegi- 
ance and gratitude to a distant benefactor, grasped and abused the 
fruits of prosperity; and after running the little course of an Oriental 
dynasty, were now fainting in their own weakness. On the side of the 
land they were oppressed by the Almohades, the fanatic princes of 
Morocco, while the seacoast was open to the enterprise of the Greeks 
and Franks, who, before the close of the eleventh century, had extorted 
a ransom of two hundred thousand pieces of gold. By the first arms of 
Roger, the island or rock of Malta, which has been since ennobled by a 
military and religious colony, was inseparably annexed to the crown 
of Sicily. Tripoli, 105 a strong and maritime city, was the next object 
of his attack; and the slaughter of the males, the captivity of the

females, might be justified by the frequent practice of the Moslems 
themselves. The capital of lie Zeirides was named Africa from the 
country, and Mahadia loe from the Arabian founder: it is strongly built 
on a neck of land, but the imperfection of the harbour is not compen- 
sated by the fertility of the adjacent plain. Mahadia was besieged by 
George the Sicilian admiral, with a fleet of one hundred and fifty gal- 
leys, amply provided with men and the instruments of mischief: the 
sovereign had fled, the Moorish governor refused to capitulate, declined 
the last and irresistible assault, and, secretly escaping with the Moslem 
inhabitants, abandoned the place and its treasures to the rapacious 
Franks. In successive expeditions the king of Sicily or his lieutenants 
reduced the cities of Tunis, Safax, Capsia, Bona, and a long tract of 
the sea-coast; 107 the fortresses were garrisoned, the country was tribu- 
tary, and a boast that it held Africa in subjection might be inscribed 
with some flattery on the sword of Roger. 108 After his death that sword 
was broken; and these transmarine possessions were neglected, evacu- 
ated, or lost, under the troubled reign of his successor. 109 The triumphs 
of Scipio and Belisarius have proved that the African continent is neither 
inaccessible nor invincible; yet the great princes and powers of Christen- 
dom have repeatedly failed in their armaments against the Moors, who 
may still glory in the easy conquest and long servitude of Spain. 

Since the decease of Robert Guiscard the Normans had relinquished, 
above sixty years, their hostile designs against the empire of the East. 
The policy of Roger solicited a public and private union with the Greek 
princes, whose alliance would dignify his regal character: he demanded 
in marriage a daughter of the Comnenian family, and the first steps of 
the treaty seemed to promise a favourable event. But the contemptu- 
ous treatment of his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new 
monarch; and the insolence of the Byzantine court was expiated accord- 
ing to the laws of nations, by the sufferings of a guiltless people. 110 
With a fleet of seventy galleys George the admiral of Sicily appeared 
before Corfu; and both the island and city were delivered into his 
hands by the disaffected inhabitants, who had yet to learn that a siege

is still more calamitous than a tribute. In this invasion, of some mo- 
ment in the annals of commerce, the Normans spread themselves by 
sea, and over the provinces of Greece; and the venerable age of Athens, 
Thebes, and Corinth, was violated by rapine and cruelty. Of the wrongs 
of Athens no memorial remains. The ancient walls which encompassed, 
without guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were scaled by the Latin 
Christians; but their sole use of the Gospel was to sanctify an oath that 
the lawful owners had not secreted any relic of their inheritance or 
industry. On the approach of the Normans the lower town of Corinth 
was evacuated: the Greeks retired to the citadel, which was seated on 
a lofty eminence, abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene; 
an impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by 
any advantages of art or nature. As soon as the besiegers had sur- 
mounted the labour (their sole labour) of climbing the Mil, their gen- 
eral-, from the commanding eminence, admired his own victory, and 
testified his gratitude to Heaven by tearing from the altar the precious 
image of Theodore the tutelary saint. The silk-weavers of both sexes, 
whom George transported to Sicily, composed the most valuable part 
of the spoil; and in comparing the skilful industry of the mechanic with 
the sloth and cowardice of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the 
distaff and loom were the only weapons which the Greeks were capable 
of using. The progress of this naval armament was marked by two 
conspicuous events, the rescue of the king of France and the insult of 
the Byzantine capital. In his return by sea from an unfortunate cru- 
sade, Louis the Seventh was intercepted by the Greeks, who basely 
violated the laws of honour and religion. The fortunate encounter of 
the Norman fleet delivered the royal captive; and after a free and 
honourable entertainment in the court of Sicily, Louis continued his 
journey to Rome and Paris. 111 In the absence of the emperor, Con- 
stantinople and the Hellespont were left without defence and without the 
suspicion of danger. The clergy and people, for the soldiers had fol- 
lowed the standard of Manuel, were astonished and dismayed at the 
hostile appearance of a line of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the 
front of the Imperial city. The forces of the Sicilian admiral were 
inadequate to the siege or assault of an immense and populous metrop- 
olis; but George enjoyed the glory of humbling the Greek .arrogance, 
and of marking the path of conquest to the navies of the West. He 
landed some soldiers to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and pointed 
with silver, or more probably with fire, the arrows which he discharged 
against the palace of the Caesars. 112 This playful outrage of the pirates

of Sicily, who bad surprised an unguarded moment, Manuel affected 
to despise, while his martial spirit and the forces of the empire were 
awakened to revenge. The Archipelago and Ionian Sea were covered 
with his squadrons and those of Venice; but I know not by what favour- 
able allowance of transports, victuallers, and pinnaces, our reason, or 
even our fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous account of fifteen 
hundred vessels, which is proposed by a Byzantine historian. These 
operations were directed with prudence and energy: in his homeward 
voyage George lost nineteen of his galleys, which were separated and 
taken: after an obstinate defence Corfu implored the clemency of her 
lawful sovereign; nor could a ship, a soldier, of the Norman prince, be 
found, unless a captive, within the limits of the Eastern empire. The 
prosperity and the health of Roger were already in a declining state: 
while he listened in his palace of Palermo to the messengers of victory 
or defeat, the invincible Manuel, the foremost in every assault, .was 
celebrated by the Greeks and Latins as the Alexander or Hercules of the 
age. 

A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having repelled 
the insolence of a barbarian. It was the right and duty, it might be the 
interest and glory, of Manuel to restore the ancient majesty of the 
empire, to recover the provinces of Italy and Sicily, and to chastise this 
pretended king, the grandson of a Norman vassal. 113 The natives of 
Calabria were still attached to the Greek language and worship, which 
had been inexorably proscribed by the Latin clergy: after the loss of 
her dukes Apulia was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of 
Sicily: the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his 
death had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his sub- 
jects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the seeds of 
rebellion; and a nephew of Roger himself invited the enemies of his 
family and nation. The majesty of the purple, and a series of Hun- 
garian and Turkish wars, prevented Manuel from embarking his person 
in the Italian expedition. To the brave and noble Palaeologus, his lieu- 
tenant, the Greek monarch intrusted a fleet and army: the siege of Bari 
was his first exploit; and, in every operation, gold as well as steel was 
the instrument of victory. Salerno, and some places along the west- 
ern coast, maintained their fidelity to the Norman king; but he lost in 
two compaigns the greater part of his continental possessions; and the 
modest emperor, disdaining all flattery and falsehood, was content with 
the reduction of three hundred cities or villages of Apulia and Calabria,

whose names and titles were inscribed on all the walls of the palace. 
The prejudices of the Latins were gratified by a genuine or fictitious 
donation under the seal of the German Caesars; 114 but the successor 
of Constantine soon renounced this ignominious pretence, claimed the 
indefeasible dominion of Italy, and professed his design of chasing the 
barbarians beyond the Alps. By the artful speeches, liberal gifts, and 
unbounded promises of their Eastern ally, the free cities were encour- 
aged to persevere in their generous struggle against the despotism of 
Frederic Barbarossa: the walls of Milan were rebuilt by the contribu- 
tions of Manuel; and he poured, says the historian, a river of gold into 
the bosom of Ancona, whose attachment to the Greeks was fortified by 
the jealous enmity of the Venetians. 115 The situation and trade of An- 
cona rendered it an important garrison in the heart of Italy: it was 
twice besieged by the arms of Frederic; the Imperial forces were twice 
repulsed by the spirit of freedom; that spirit was animated by the am- 
bassador of Constantinople; and the most intrepid patriots, the most 
faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and honours of the By- 
zantine court. 110 The pride of Manuel disdained and rejected a bar- 
barian colleague; his ambition was excited by the hope of stripping the 
purple from the German usurpers, and of establishing in the West as in 
the East his lawful title of sole emperor of the Romans. With this 
view he solicited the alliance of the people and the bishop of Rome. 
Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the Greek monarch; the 
splendid nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured the sup- 
port of that powerful family, 117 and his royal standard or image was 
entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis. 118 During the 
quarrel between Frederic and Alexander the Third, the pope twice re 
ceived in the Vatican the ambassadors of Constantinople. They flat 
tered his piety by the long-promised union of the two churches, temptec 
the avarice of his venal court, and exhorted the Roman pontiff to seizt 
the just provocation, the favourable moment, to humble the savage 

314 The Latin, Otho (de Gestis Frederic! I. 1. ii. c. 30, p. 734), attests th 
forgery; the Greek, Cinnamus (1. iv. c. I, p. 78 [p. 135, ed. Bonn]), claims 
a promise of restitution from Conrad and ' Frederic. An act of fraud is 
always credible when it is told of the Greeks. 

118 Quod Anconitani Graecum imperium nimis diligerent . . . Veneti speciali 
odio Anconam oderunt. The cause of love, perhaps of envy, were the 
beneficia, flumen aureum of the emperor; and the Latin narrative is con- 
firmed by Cinnamus (I. iv. c. 14, p. 98 [p. 170, ed. Bonn]). 

^Muratori mentions the two sieges of Ancona; the first, in 1167, against 
Frederic I. in person (Annali, torn. x. p. 39, etc.) ; the second, in 1173, 
against his lieutenant Christian, Archbishop of Mentz, a man unworthy of 
his name and office (p. 76, etc.). It is of the second siege that we possess 
an original narrative, which he has published in his great collection (torn, 
vi, p. 921-946). 

117 We derive this anecdote from an anonymous chronicle of Fossa Nova, 
published by Muratori (Script. Ital. torn. vii. p. 874). 

114 The Bcw&amp;iop ffTjfuiop of Cinnamus (1. iv. c. 14 p. 99 [p. 171, ed. Bonn]) 
is susceptible of this double sense. A standard is more Lathi, an image 
more Greek.

of Constantine and Augustus. 119 

But these Italian conquests, this universal reign, soon escaped from 
the hand of the Greek emperor. His first demands were eluded by 
the prudence of Alexander the Third, who paused on this deep and mo- 
mentous revolution; 120 nor could the pope be seduced by a personal dis- 
pute to renounce the -perpetual inheritance of the Latin name. After 
his re-union with Frederic, he spoke a more peremptory language, con- 
firmed the acts of his predecessors, excommunicated the adherents of 
Manuel, and pronounced the final separation of the churches, or at least 
the empires, of Constantinople and Rome. 121 The free cities of Lom- 
bardy no longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and, without pre- 
serving the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity of 
Venice. 122 By his own avarice, or the complaints of his subjects, the 
Greek emperor was provoked to arrest the persons, and confiscate the 
effects, of the Venetian merchants. This violation of the public faith 
exasperated a free and commercial people: one hundred galleys were 
launched and armed in as many days; they swept the coasts of Dalma- 
tia and Greece: but after some mutual wounds, the war was terminated 
by an agreement, inglorious to the empire, insufficient for the republic; 
and a complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved 
for the succeeding generation. The lieutenant of Manuel had informed 
his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any domestic revolt 
of Apulia and Calabria; but that his forces were inadequate to resist 
the impending attack of the king of Sicily. His prophecy was soon veri- 
fied: the death of Palseologus devolved the command on several chiefs, 
alike eminent in rank, alike defective in military talents; the Greeks 
were oppressed by land and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped 
the swords of the Normans and Saracens abjured all future hostility 
against the person or dominions of their conqueror. 123 Yet the king

of Sicily esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel, who had landed 
a second army on the Italian shore: he respectfully addressed the new 
Justinian; solicited a peace or truce of thirty years; accepted as a gift 
the regal title; and acknowledged himself the military vassal of the 
Roman empire. 12 * The Byzantine Caesars acquiesced in this shadow 
of dominion, without expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service 
of a Norman army; and the truce of thirty years was not disturbed by 
any hostilities between Sicily and Constantinople. About the end of 
that period, the throne of Manuel was usurped by an inhuman tyrant, 
who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and mankind: the sword 
of William the Second, the grandson of Roger, was drawn by a fugitive 
of the Comnenian race; and the subjects of Andronicus might salute 
the strangers as friends, since they detested their sovereign as the worst 
of enemies. The Latin historians 125 expatiate on the rapid progress of 
the four counts who invaded Romania with a fleet and army, and re- 
duced many castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily. 
The Greeks 126 accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious cruel- 
ties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica, the second city 
of the empire. The former deplore the fate of those invincible but 
unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the arts of a vanquished 
foe. The latter applaud, in songs of triumph, the repeated victories oi 
their countrymen on the sea of Marmora or Propontis, on the banks 
of the Strymon, and under the walls of Durazzo. A revolution which 
punished the crimes of Andronicus had united against the Franks the 
zeal and courage of the successful insurgents: ten thousand. were slain 
in battle; and Isaac Angelus, the new emperor, might indulge his vanity 
or vengeance in the treatment of four thousand captives. Such was the 
event of the last contest between the Greeks and Normans: before the 
expiration of twenty years the rival nations were lost or degraded in 
foreign servitude; and the successors of Constantine did not long sur- 
vive to insult the fall of the Sicilian monarchy. 

The sceptre of Roger successively devolved to his son and grandson: 
they might be confounded under the name of William: they are strongly 
discriminated by the epithets of the bad and the good; but these epi- 

"*For the epistle of William I. see Cinnamus (1. iv. c. 15, p. 101, 102 
[p. 173-175, ed. Bonn]) and Nicetas (1. ii. c. 8 [p. 128, ed. Bonn]). It is 
difficult to affirm whether these Greeks deceived themselves or the public 
in these flattering portraits of the grandeur of the empire. 

125 1 can only quote of original evidence the poor chronicles of Sicard of 
Cremona (p. 603), and of Fossa Nova (p. 875), as they^are published in the 
seventh tome of Muratori's historians. The king of Sicily sent his troops

328 By the failure of Cinnamus, we are now reduced to Nicetas (in 
Andronico, 1. i. c. 7, 8, 9, 1. ii. c. I, in Isaac Angelo^ 1. i. c. 1-4), who now 
becomes a respectable contemporary. As he survived the emperor and 
the empire, he is above flattery: but the fall of Constantinople exasperated 
his prejudices against the Latins. For the honour of learning I shall 
observe that Homer's great commentator, Eustathms, archbishop of Thes- 
salonica, refused to desert his flock.

thets, which appear to describe the perfection of vice and virtue, cannot 
strictly be applied to either of the Norman princes. When he was 
roused to arms by danger and shame, the first William did not degen- 
erate from the valour of his race; but his temper was slothful; his man- 
ners were dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the 
monarch is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for those of 
Majo, the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and conspired 
against the life, of his benefactor. From the Arabian conquest, Sicily 
had imbibed a deep tincture of Oriental manners; the despotism, the 
pomp, and even the harem, of a sultan; and a Christian people was op- 
pressed and insulted by the ascendant of the eunuchs, who openly pro- 
fessed, or secretly cherished, the religion of Mohammed. An eloquent 
historian of the times 12T has delineated the misfortunes of his coun- 
try: 128 the ambition and fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and 
punishment of his assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the 
king himself; the private feuds that arose from the public confusion; 
and the various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo, 
the island, and the continent, during the reign of William the First, and 
the minority of his son. The youth, innocence, and beauty of William 
the Second, 128 endeared him to the nation: the factions were reconciled; 
the laws were revived; and from the manhood to the premature death 
of that amiable prince, Sicily enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, 
and happiness, whose value was enhanced by the remembrance of the 
past and the dread of futurity. The legitimate male posterity of Tan- 
cred of Hauteville was extinct in the person of the second William; but 
his aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful prince 
of the age; and Henry the Sixth, the son of Frederic Barbarossa, de- 

121 The Historia jSicula of Hugo Falcandus, which properly extends from 
1154 to 1169, is inserted in the seventh volume of Muratori's Collection 
(torn. vii. p. 259-344), and preceded by an eloquent preface or epistle 
(p. 251-258, de Calamitatibus Siciliae). Falcandus has been styled the 
Tacitus of Sicily; and, after a just, but immense, abatement, from the 
first to the twelfth century, from a senator to a monk, I would not strip 
him of his title: his narrative is rapid and perspicuous, his style bold and 
elegant, his observation keen; he had studied mankind, and feels like a 
man, I can only regret the narrow and barren, field on which his labours 
.have been cast. 

^The laborious Benedictines (1'Art de verifier les Dates, p. 896), are of 
opinion that the true name of Falcandus is Fulcandus or Foucault. Ac- 
cording to them, Hugues Foucault, a Frenchman by birth, and at length 
Abbot of St. Denys, had followed into Sicily his patron Stephen de k 
Perche, uncle to the mother of William II., archbishop of Palermo, and 
great chancellor of the kingdom. Yet Falcandus has all the feelings of a 
Sicilian ; and the title of Alumnus (which he bestows on himself) appears to 
indicate that he was bora, or at least educated, in the island. 

^Falcand. p. 303. Richard de St Germano begins his history from the 
death and praises of William IL After some unmeaning epithets, he thus 
continues: Legis et justitiae cuhus tempore suo vigebat in regno; sua erat

scended from the Alps, to claim the Imperial crown and the inheritance 
of his wife. Against the unanimous wish of a free people, this inheri- 
tance could only be acquired by arms; and I am pleased to transcribe 
the style and sense of the historian Falcandus, who writes at the mo* 
ment, and on the spot, with the feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic 
eye of a statesman. " Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from 
her cradle in the pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and 
manners, of this fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the bar- 
barians with our treasures, and now returns, with her savage allies, to 
contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent. Already I behold 
the swarms of angry barbarians: our opulent cities, the places flourish- 
ing in a long peace, are shaken with fear, desolated by slaughter, con- 
sumed by rapine, and polluted by intemperance and lust. I see the mas- 
sacre or captivity of our citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons. 130 
In this extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the Sicilians act? 
By the unanimous election of a king of valour and experience, Sicily 
and Calabria might yet be preserved; 181 for in the levity of the Apulians, 
ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose neither confidence nor 
hope. 182 Should Calabria be lost, the lofty towers, the numerous youth, 
and the naval strength of Messina, 133 might guard the passage against 
a foreign invader. If the savage Germans coalesce with the pirates of 
Messina; if they destroy with fire the fruitful region, so often wasted 
by the fires of Mount JEtna, 134 what resource will be left for the interior 
parts of the island, these noble cities which should never be violated 
by the hostile footsteps of a barbarian? 135 Catana has again been over- 
whelmed by an earthquake: the ancient virtue of Syracuse expires in 
poverty and solitude; 130 but Palermo is still crowned with a diadem,

and her triple walls enclose the active multitudes of Christians and 
Saracens. If the two nations, under one king, can unite for their com- 
mon safety, they may rush on the barbarians with invincible arms. 
But if the Saracens, fatigued by a repetition of injuries, should now 
retire and rebel; if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and 
sea-coast, the unfortunate Christians, exposed to a double attack, and 
placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil, must resign them- 
selves to hopeless and inevitable servitude." 18T We must not forget 
that a priest here prefers his country to his religion: and that the Mos- 
lems, whose alliance he seeks, were still numerous and powerful in the 
state of Sicily. 

The hopes, or at least the wishes, of Falcandus were at first gratified 
by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the grandson of the 
first king, whose birth was illegitimate, but whose civil and military 
virtues shone without a blemish. During four years, the term of his 
life and reign, he stood in arms on the farthest verge of the Apulian 
frontier against the powers of Germany; and the restitution of a royal 
captive, of Constantia herself, without injury or ransom, may appear 
to surpass the most liberal measure of policy or reason. After his de- 
cease the kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle, 
and Henry pursued his victorious march from Capua to Palermo. The 
political balance of Italy was destroyed by his success; and if the pope 
and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real interest, they 
would have combined the powers of earth and heaven to prevent the 
dangerous union of the German empire with the kingdom of Sicily. But 
the subtle policy, for which the Vatican has so often been praised or 
arraigned, was on this occasion blind and inactive; and if it were true 
that Celestine the Third had kicked away the Imperial crown from the 
head of the prostrate Henry, 188 such an act of impotent pride could 
serve only to cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy. The Genoese, 
who enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened to 
the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure: 139 their

lightly weigh against the silence of German and Italian history (Muratori,

fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the harbour of 
Palermo; and the first act of his government was to abolish the privi- 
leges and to seize the property of these imprudent allies. The last hope 
of Falcandus was defeated by the discord of the Christians and Mo- 
hammedans: they fought in the capital; several thousands of the latter 
were slain, but their surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and 
disturbed above thirty years the peace of the island. By the policy of 
Frederic the Second, sixty thousand Saracens were transplanted to 
Nocera in Apulia. In their wars against the Roman church, the em- 
peror and his son Mainfroy were strengthened and disgraced by the 
service of the enemies of Christ; and this national colony maintained 
their religion and manners in the heart of Italy till they were extirpated, 
at the end of the thirteenth century, by the zeal and revenge of the 
house of Anjou. 140 All the calamities which the prophetic orator had 
deplored were surpassed by the cruelty and avarice of the German con- 
queror. He violated the royal sepulchres, and explored the secret treas- 
ures of the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom; the pearls and 
jewels, however precious, might be easily removed, but one hundred 
and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of Sicily. 1 * 1 The 
young king, his mother and sisters, and the nobles of both sexes, were 
separately confined in the fortresses of the Alps, and, on the slightest 
rumour of rebellion, the captives were deprived of life, of their eyes, 
or the hope of posterity. Constantia herself was touched with sym- 
pathy for the miseries of her country, and the heiress of the Norman 
line might struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the patri- 
mony of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age 
under the name of Frederic the Second. Ten years after this revolu- 
tion, the French monarchs annexed to their crown the duchy of Nor- 
mandy: the sceptre of her ancient dukes had been transmitted, by a 
granddaughter of William the Conqueror, to the house of Plantagenet; 
and the adventurous Normans, who had raised so many trophies in

Matteo Spinelli de Giovenazzo (torn. vii. p. 1064), Nicholas de Jamsilla

these insinuates, that, in reducing the Saracens of Nocera, Charles II. of 
Anjou employed rather artifice than violence. ^

ita ut oneratis 160 somariis, glpriose ad terram suam redient Roger de

computes the spoil of Salerno at 200,000 ounces of gold (p. 746). On these 
occasions I am almost tempted to exclaim with^ the listening maid in La 
Fontaine, "Je voudrois bien avoir ce qui manque."

were violated and ransacked by their degenerate successor Alexius Com- 
nenus to enable him to pay the German tribute exacted by the menaces of

FROM the isle of Sicily the reader must transport himself beyond the 
Caspian Sea to the original seat of the Turks or Turkmans, against 
whom the first crusade wa$ principally directed. Their Scythian empire 
of the sixth century was long since dissolved, but the name was still 
famous among the Greeks and Orientals, and the fragments of the na- 
tion, each a powerful and independent people, were scattered over the 
desert from China to the Oxus and the Danube: the colony of Hun- 
garians was admitted into the republic of Europe, and the thrones of 
Asia were occupied by slaves and soldiers of Turkish extraction. While' 
Apulia and Sicily were subdued by the Norman lance, a swarm of these 
northern shepherds overspread the kingdoms of Persia- their princes of 
the race of Seljuk erected a splendid and solid empire from Samarcand 
to the confines of Greece, and Egypt, and the Turks have maintained 
their dominion in Asia Minor till the victorious crescent has been planted 
on thedome of St. Sophia. 

One of the greatest of the Turkish princes was Mamood or Mahmud, 1 
the Gaznevide, who reigned in the eastern provinces of Persia one thou- 
sand years after the birth of Christ. His father Sebectagi was the slave 
of the slave of the slave of the commander of the faithful. But in this, 
descent of servitude the first degree was merely titular, since it was 
filled by the sovereign of Transoxiana and Chorasan, who still paid a 
nominal allegiance to the caliph of Bagdad. The second rank was that 
of a minister of state, a lieutenant of the Saiuanides, 2 who broke, by his 
revolt, the bonds of political slavery. But the third step was a state of 
real and domestic servitude in the family of that rebel, from which Se- 

a l am indebted for his character and history to D'Herbelot (Biblioth4que 
Orientale, Mahmud &gt; p. 533-537), M. de Guignes (Histoire des Huns, torn. 
*&amp; P- I55-I73)&gt; and our countryman Colonel Alexander Dow (vol. i. p. 23-83), 
In the two first volumes of his History of Hindostan he styles himself 
the translator of the Persian Ferishta; but in his florid text it is not easy 
to distinguish the version and the original

bectagi, by his courage and dexterity, ascended to the supreme com- 
mand of the city and province of Gazna 8 as the son-in-law and suc- 
cessor of his grateful master. The falling dynasty of the Samanides 
was at first protected, and at last overthrown, by their servants, and, 
in the public disorders, the fortune of Mahmud continually increased. 
For him the title of Sultan 4 ' was first invented; and his kingdom was 
enlarged from Transoxiana to the neighbourhood of Ispahan, from the 
shores of the Caspian to the mouth of the Indus. But the principal 
source of his fame and riches was the holy war which he waged against 
the Gentoos of Hindostan. In this foreign narrative I may not con- 
sume a page, and a volume would scarcely suffice to recapitulate the 
battles and sieges of his twelve expeditions. Never was the Musulman 
hero dismayed by the inclemency of the seasons, the height of the moun- 
tains, the breadth of the rivers, the barrenness of the desert, the multi- 
tudes of the enemy, or the formidable array of their elephants of war/' 
The sultan of Gazna surpassed the limits of the conquests of Alexander; 
after a march of three months, over the hills of Cashmir and Thibet, he 
reached the famous city of Kinoge, 6 on the Upper Ganges, and, in a

pr Chaldaic word that signifies lord and master (D'Herbelot, p. 825). It 
is interpreted A&amp;roKp&amp;Ttap, BeMriXe&amp;s, Bo&lt;rtX&amp;uy, by the Byzantine writers of 
the eleventh century; and the name (SowXra^j, Soldanus) is familiarly 
employed in the Greek and Latin languages, after it had passed from the 
Gaznevides to the Seljukides, and other emirs of Asia and Egypt. Ducange 
(Dissertation xvi. sur Joinville, p. 238-240, Gloss. Graec. et Latin.) labours 
to find the title of Sultan in the ancient kingdom of Persia: but his proofs/ 
are mere shadows; a proper name in the Themes of Constantine (ii, n 
[torn. iii. p. 6 1, ed. Bonn]}, an anticipation of Zonaras, etc., and a medal 
of Kai Khosrou, not (as he believes) the Sassanide of the sixth, but the 
Seljukide of Iconium of the thirteenth century (De Guignes, Hist, des 
Huns, torn. i. p. 246). 

[It is uncertain when the title "sultan" was first used, but it seems at 
all events, to have been anterior to the time of Mahmud. It is mentioned 
by Halebi under the reign of Motawaccel in the ninth century but accord- 
ing to Ibn Chaldun.it was first assumed by the Bowides. Vambery thinks 
that the name of one of the sons of the Hungarian chief Arpad, ZaXras or 
Zoltan, was really his designation of rank sultan. O. S.] 

e Ferishta (apud Dow, Hist, of Hindostan, vol. i. p. 49) mentions the 
report of a gun in the Indian army. But as I am slow in believing this 
premature (A.D. 1008) .use of artillery, I must desire to scrutinise first the 
text and then the authority of Ferishta, who lived in the Mogul court in 
the last century. 

[Milman says in -his edition, "This passage is differently written in the 
various MSS. I have seen; and in some the word tope, gun, has been 
written for nupth, naphtha, and toofung, musket, for khudung, arrow. But 
no Persian or Arabic history speaks of gunpowder before the time usually 
assigned for its invention (A.D. 1317), long after which it was first applied 
to the purposes of war. Briggs' Ferishta." O. S.]

naval combat on one of the branches of the Indus, he fought and van- 
quished four thousand boats of the natives. Delhi, Lahor, and Multan 
were compelled to open their gates; the fertile kingdom of Guzarat at- 
tracted his ambition and tempted his stay; and his avarice indulged 
the fruitless project of discovering the golden and aromatic isles of the 
Southern Ocean. On the payment of a tribute the rajahs preserved 
their dominions, the people their lives and fortunes: but to the religion of 
Hindostan the zealous Musulman was cruel and inexorable; many hun- 
dred temples or pagodas were levelled with the ground, many thousand 
idols were demolished, and the servants of the prophet were stimulated 
and rewarded by the precious materials of which they were com- 
posed. The pagoda of Sumnat was situate on the promontory of Guza- 
rat, in the neighbourhood of Diu, one of the last remaining possessions 
of the Portuguese. 7 It was endowed with the revenue of two thousand 
villages; two thousand Brahmins were consecrated to the service of the 
deity, whom they washed each morning and evening in water from the 
distant Ganges; the subordinate ministers consisted of three hundred 
musicians, three hundred barbers, and five hundred dancing girls, con- 
spicuous for their birth or beauty. Three sides of the temple were 
protected by the ocean, the narrow isthmus was fortified by a natural 
or artificial precipice, and the city and adjacent country were peopled 
by a nation of fanatics. They confessed the sins and the punishment 
of Kinoge and Delhi; but if the impious stranger should presume to 
approach their holy precincts, he would surely be overwhelmed by a 
blast of the divine vengeance. By this challenge the faith of Mahmud 
was animated to a personal trial of the strength of this Indian deity. 
Fifty thousand of ids worshippers were pierced by the spear of the 
Moslems; the walls were scaled, the sanctuary was profaned, and the 
conqueror aimed a blow of his iron mace at the head of the idol. The 
trembling Brahmins are said to have offered ten millions sterling for 
his ransom; and it was urged by the wisest counsellors that the destruc- 
tion of a stone image would not change the hearts of the Gentoos, and 
that such a sum might be dedicated to the relief of the true believers. 
"Your reasons," replied the sultan, "are specious and strong; but 
never in the eyes of posterity shall Mahmud appear as a merchant of 
idols." He repeated his blows, and a treasure of pearls and rubies, con- 
cealed in the belly of the statue, explained in some degree the devout 
prodigality of the Brahmins. The fragments of the idol were distrib- 
uted to Gazna, Mecca, and Medina. Bagdad listened to the edifying 
tale, and Mahmud was saluted by the caliph with the title of guardian 
of the fortune and faith of Mohammed.

refuse to turn aside to gather some flowers of science or virtue. The 
name of Mahmud the Gaznevide is still venerable in the East: his sub- 
jects enjoyed the blessings of prosperity and peace; his vices were con- 
cealed by the veil of religion; and two familiar examples will testify 
his justice and magnanimity. I. As he sat in the divan, an unhappy 
subject bowed before the throne to accuse the insolence of a Turkish 
soldier who had driven him from his house and bed. " Suspend your 
clamours," said Mahmud; " inform me of his next visit, and ourself in 
person will judge and punish the offender." The sultan followed his 
guide, invested the house with his guards, and, extinguishing the torches, 
pronounced the death of the criminal, who had been seized in the act 
of rapine and adultery. After the execution of his sentence the lights 
were rekindled, Mahmud fell prostrate in prayer, and, rising from the 
ground, demanded some homely fare, which he devoured with the vora- 
ciousness of hunger. The poor man, whose injury he had avenged, was 
unable to suppress his astonishment and curiosity; and the courteous 
monarch condescended to explain the motives of this singular behaviour. 
" I had reason to suspect that none, except one of my sons, could dare 
to perpetrate such an outrage; and I extinguished the lights that my 
justice might be blind and inexorable. My prayer was a thanksgiving 
on the discovery of the offender; and so painful was my anxiety, that I 
had passed three days without food since the first moment of your com- 
plaint." II. The sultan of Gazna had declared war against the dynasty 
of the Bowides, the sovereigns of the western Persia; he was disarmed 
by an epistle of the sultana mother, and delayed his invasion till the 
manhood of her son. 8 " During the life of my husband," said the art- 
ful regent, " I was ever apprehensive of your ambition: he was a prince 
and a soldier worthy of your arms. He is now no more; his sceptre has 
passed to a woman and a child, and you dare not attack their infancy 
and weakness. How inglorious would be your conquest, how shameful 
your defeat! and yet the event of war is in the hand of the Almighty." 
Avarice was the only defect that tarnished the illustrious character of 
Mahmud; and never has that passion been more richly satiated. The 
Orientals exceed the measure of credibility in the account of millions of 
gold and silver, such as the avidity of man has never accumulated; in 
the magnitude of pearls, diamonds, and rubies, such as have never been 
produced by the workmanship of nature. 9 Yet the soil of Hindostan is 
impregnated with precious minerals: her trade, in every age, has at- 
tracted the gold and silver of the world; and her virgin spoils were 
rifled by the first of the Mohammedan conquerors. His behaviour, in

the last days of his life, evinces the vanity of these possessions, so 
laboriously won, so dangerously held, and so inevitably lost. He sur- 
veyed the vast and various chambers of the treasury of Gazna; burst 
into tears; and again closed the doors, without bestowing any portion 
of the wealth which he could no longer hope to preserve. The following 
day he reviewed the state of his military force; one hundred thousand 
foot, fifty-five thousand horse, and thirteen hundred elephants of bat- 
tle. 10 He again wept the instability of human greatness; and his grief 
was embittered by the hostile progress of the Turkmans, whom he had 
introduced into the heart of his Persian kingdom. 

In the modern depopulation of Asia the regular operation of govern- 
ment and agriculture is confined to the neighbourhood of cities, and the 
distant country is abandoned to the pastoral tribes of Arabs, Curds, and 
Turkmans. 11 Of the last-mentioned people, two considerable branches 
extend on either side of the Caspian Sea: the western colony can muster 
forty thousand soldiers; the eastern, less obvious to the traveller, but 
more strong and populous, has increased to the number of one hundred 
thousand families. In the midst of civilised nations they preserve the 
manners of the Scythian desert, remove their encampments with the 
change of seasons, and feed their cattle among the ruins of palaces and 
temples. Their flocks and herds are their only riches; their tents, either 
black or white, according to the colour of the banner, are covered with 
felt, and of a circular form; their winter apparel is a sheepskin; a robe 
of doth or cotton their summer garment: the features of the men are 
harsh and ferocious; the countenance of their women is soft and pleas- 
ing. Their wandering life maintains the spirit and exercise of arms; 
they fight on horseback; and their courage is displayed in frequent 
contests with each other and with their neighbours. For the licence of 
pasture they pay a slight tribute to the sovereign of the land; but the 
domestic jurisdiction is in the hands of the chiefs and elders. The first 
emigration of the Eastern Turkmans, the most ancient of their race, 
may be ascribed to the tenth century of the Christian era. 12 In the 
decline of the caliphs, and the weakness of their lieutenants, the barrier 
of the Jaxartes was often violated: in each invasion, after the victory 
or retreat of their countrymen, some wandering tribe, embracing the

Mohammedan faith, obtained a free encampment in the spacious plains 
and pleasant climate of Transoxiana and Carizme. The Turkish slaves 
who aspired to the throne encouraged these emigrations, which recruited 
their armies, awed their subjects and rivals, and protected the frontier 
against the wilder natives of Turkestan; and this policy was abused by 
Mahmud the Gaznevide beyond the example of former times. He was 
admonished of his error by a chief of the race of Seljuk, who dwelt in 
the territory of Bochara. The sultan had inquired what supply of men 
he could furnish for military service. " If you send," replied Ismael, 
" one of these arrows into our camp, fifty thousand of your servants wil* 
mount on horseback." "And if that number," continued Mahmud, 
*' should not be sufficient? " " Send this second arrow to the horde of 
Balik, and you will find fifty, thousand more." " But," said the Gazne- 
vide, dissembling his anxiety, " if I should stand in need of the whoU 
force of your kindred tribes? " " Despatch my bow," was the last 
reply of Ismael, " and, as it is circulated around, the summons will be 
obeyed by two hundred thousand horse." The apprehension of such 
formidable friendship induced Mahmud to transport the most obnoxious 
tribes into the heart of Chorasan, where they would be separated from 
their brethren by the river Oxus, and enclosed on all sides by the walls 
of obedient cities. But the face of the country was an object of tempta- 
tion rather than terror; and the vigour of government was relaxed by 
the absence and death of the sultan of Gazna. The shepherds were 
converted into robbers; the bands of robbers were collected into an army 
of conquerors; as far as Ispahan and the Tigris Persia was afflicted by 
their predatory inroads; and the Turkmans were not ashamed or afraid 
to measure their courage and numbers with the proudest sovereigns oi 
Asia. Massoud, the son and successor of Mahmud, had too long neg- 
lected the advice of his wisest Omrahs. " Your enemies," they repeal 
edly urged, " were in their origin a swarm oi ants; they are now little 
snakes; and, unless they be instantly crushed, they will acquire the 
venom and magnitude of serpents." After some alternatives of truce 
and hostility, after the repulse or partial success of his lieutenants, the 
sultan marched in person against the Turkmans, who attacked him on 
all sides with barbarous shouts and irregular onset. " Massoud," says 
the Persian historian, 18 " plunged singly to oppose the torrent of gleam- 
ing arms, exhibiting such acts of gigantic force and valour as never king 
had before displayed. A few of his friends, roused by his words and 
actions, and that innate honour which inspires the brave, seconded their 
lord so well, that, wheresoever he turned his fatal sword, the enemies 
were mowed down or retreated before him. But now, when victory 
seemed to blow on his standard, misfortune was active behind it; for 
when he looked round he beheld almost his- whole army, excepting that 
body he commanded in person, devouring the paths of flight." The 

M Dow, Hist, of Hindostan, vol. i. p. 89, 95-98. I have copied this passage 
as a specimen of the Persian manner; but I suspect that, by some odd 
fatality, the style of Ferishta has been improved by that of Ossian. . 



396 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

Gaznevide was abandoned by the cowardice or treachery of some gen- 
erals of the Turkish race; and this memorable day of Zendecan l * 
founded in Persia the dynasty of the shepherd kings. 15 

The victorious Turkmans immediately proceeded to the election of 
a king; and, if the probable tale of a Latin historian 16 deserves any 
credit, they determined by lot the choice of their new master. A num- 
ber of arrows were successively inscribed with the name of a tribe, a 
family, and a candidate^ they were drawn from the bundle by the hand 
of a child, and the important prize was obtained by Togrul Beg, the son 
of Michael, the son of Seljuk, whose surname was immortalised in the 
greatness of his posterity. The sultan Mahmud, who valued himself 
on his skill in national genealogy, professed his ignorance of the family 
of Seljuk; yet the father of that race appears to have been a chief of 
power and renown. 17 For a daring intrusion into the harem of his prince, 
Seljuk was banished from Turkestan: with a numerous tribe of his 
friends and vassals he passed the Jaxartes, encamped in the neighbour- 
hood of Samarcand, embraced the religion of Mohammed, and acquired 
the crown of martyrdom in a war against the infidels. His age, of a 
hundred and seven years, surpassed the life of his son, and Seljuk 
adopted the care of his two grandsons, Togrul and Jaafar, the eldest of 
whom, at the age of forty-five, was invested with the title of Sultan in 
the royal city of Nishabur. The blind determination of chance was 
justified by the virtues of the successful candidate. It would be super- 
fluous to praise the valour of a Turk; and the ambition of Togrul 1S was 
equal to his valour. By his arms the Gaznevides were expelled from 
the eastern kingdoms of Persia, and gradually driven to the banks of

p. 21 [p. 26, ed. Bonn]) have confounded in this revolution the truth of 
time and place, of names and persons, of causes and events. The ignorance 
arid errors of these Greeks (which I shall not stop to unravel) may inspire 
some distrust of the story of Cyaxares and Cyrus, as it is told by their most 
eloquent predecessors.

different cast to flattery and fable; and the historian Mirkhond derives the 
Seljukides from Alankavah, the virgin mother (p. 801, col. 2). If they be 
the same as the Zalsuts of Abulghazi Bahadur Khan (Hist. Genealogique,

the Indus, in search of a softer and more wealthy conquest. In the West 
he annihilated the dynasty of the Bowides; and the sceptre of Irak 
passed from the Persian to the Turkish nation. The princes who had 
felt, or who feared, the Seljukian arrows bowed their heads in the dust; 
by the conquest of Aderbijan, or Media, he approached the Roman con- 
fines; and the shepherd presumed to despatch an ambassador, or herald, 
to demand the tribute and obedience of die emperor of Constantinople. 1 * 
In his own dominions Togrul was the father of his soldiers and people; 
by a firm and equal administration Persia was relieved from the evils 
of anarchy; and the same hands which had been imbrued in blood be- 
came the guardians of justice and the public peace. The more rustic, 
perhaps the wisest, portion of the Turkmans 2Q continued to dwell hi the 
tents of their ancestors; and, from the Oxus to the Euphrates, these mili- 
tary colonies were protected and propagated by their native princes. 
But the Turks of the court and city were refined by business and sof- 
tened by pleasure: they imitated the dress, language, and manners of 
Persia; and the royal palaces of Nishabur and Rei displayed the order 
and magnificence of a great monarchy. The most deserving of the Ara- 
bians and Persians were promoted to the honours of the state; and the 
whole body of the Turkish nation embraced with fervour and sincerity 
the religion of Mohammed. The northern swarms of barbarians who 
overspread both Europe and Asia have been irreconcilably separated 
by the consequences of a similar conduct. Among the Moslems, as 
among the Christians, their vague and local traditions have yielded to 
the reason and authority of the prevailing system, to the fame of an- 
tiquity, and the consent of nations. But the triumph of the Koran is 
more pure and meritorious as it was not assisted by any visible splen- 
dour of worship which might allure the pagans by some resemblance 
of idolatry. The first of the Seljukian sultans was conspicuous by his 
zeal and faith; each day he repeated the five prayers which are enjoined 
to the true believers; of each week the two first days were consecrated 
by an extraordinary fast; and in every city a mosch was completed be- 
fore Togrul presumed to lay the foundations of a palace. 21 

With the belief of the Koran, the son of Seljuk imbibed a lively rev- 
erence for the successor of the prophet. But that sublime character 
was still disputed by the caliphs of Bagdad and Egypt, and each of the 
rivals was solicitous to prove his title in the judgment of the strong,

though illiterate, barbarians. Mahmud the Gaznevide had declared 
himself in favour of the line of Abbas; and had treated with indignity 
the robe of honour which was presented by the Fatimite ambassador. 
Yet the ungrateful Hashemite had changed with the change of fortune; 
he applauded the victory of Zendecan, and named the Seljukian sultan 
his temporal vicegerent over the Moslem world. As Togrul executed 
and enlarged this important trust, he was called to the deliverance of 
the caliph Cayem, and obeyed the holy summons, which gave a new 
kingdom to his anns. 2S In the palace of Bagdad the commander of the 
faithful still slumbered, a venerable phantom. His servant or master, 
the prince of the Bowides, could no longer protect him from the inso- 
lence of meaner tyrants; and the Euphrates and Tigris were oppressed 
by the revolt of the Turkish and Arabian emirs. The presence of a 
conqueror was implored as a blessing; and the transient mischiefs of 
fire and sword were excused as the sharp but salutary remedies which 
alone could restore the health of the republic. At the head of an irre- 
sistible force the sultan of Persia marched from Hamadan: the proud 
were crushed, the prostrate were spared; the prince of the Bowides dis- 
appeared; the heads of the most obstinate rebels were laid at the feet of 
Togrul; and he inflicted a lesson of obedience on the people of Mosul 
and Bagdad. After the chastisement of the guilty, and the restoration 
of peace, the royal shepherd accepted the reward of his labours; and a 
solemn comedy represented the triumph of religious prejudice over bar- 
barian power, 23 The Turkish sultan embarked on the Tigris, landed at 
the gate of Racca, and made his public entry on horseback. At the 
palace-gate he respectfully dismounted, and walked on foot, preceded 
by his emirs without arms. The caliph was seated behind his black 
veil: the black garment of the Abbassides was cast over his shoulders, 
and he held in his hand the staff of the apostle of God. The conqueror 
of the East kissed the ground, stood some time in a modest posture, and 
was led towards the throne by the vizir and an interpreter. After Tog- 
rul had seated himself on another throne his commission was publicly 
read, which declared him the temporal lieutenant of the vicar of the 
prophet. He was successively invested with seven robes of honour, 
and presented with seven slaves, the natives- of the seven climates of 
the Arabian empire. His mystic veil was perfumed with musk; two 
crowns were placed on his head; two scimitars were girded to his side&gt; 
as the symbols of a double reign over the East and West. After this 
inauguration the sultan was prevented from prostrating himself a sec- 
ond time; but he twice kissed the hand of the commander of the faith- 
ful, and his titles were proclaimed by the voice of heralds and the ap- 
plause of the Moslems. In a second visit to Bagdad the Seljukian prince

p. 197, 198), and that learned author is obliged to Bondari, who composed

THE ROMAN EMPIRE 399 

again rescued the caliph from his enemies; and devoutly, on foot, led 
the bridle of his mule from the prison to the palace. Their alliance was 
cemented by the marriage of TogruPs sister with the successor of the 
prophet. Without reluctance he had introduced a Turkish virgin into 
his harem; but Cayein proudly refused his daughter to the sultan, dis- 
dained to mingle the blood of the Hashemites with the blood of a Scy- 
thian shepherd; and protracted the negotiation many months, till the 
gradual diminution of his revenue admonished him that he was still in 
the hands of a master. The royal nuptials were followed by the death 
of Togrul himself; 24 as he left no children, his nephew Alp Arslan suc- 
ceeded to the title and prerogatives of sultan; and his name, after that 
of the caliph, was pronounced in the public prayers of the Moslems. 
Yet in this revolution the Abbassides acquired a larger measure of lib- 
erty and power. On the throne of Asia the Turkish monarchs were less 
jealous of the domestic administration of Bagdad; and the commanders 
of the faithful were relieved from the ignominious vexations to which 
they had been exposed by the presence and poverty of the Persian 
dynasty. 

Since the fall of the caliphs, the discord and degeneracy of the Sara- 
cens respected the Asiatic provinces of Rome; which, by the victories 
of Nicephorus, Zimisces, and Basil, had been extended as far as Antioch 
and the eastern boundaries of Armenia. Twenty-five years after the 
death of Basil, his successors were suddenly assaulted by an unknown 
race of barbarians, who united the Scythian valour with the fanaticism 
of new proselytes, and the art and riches of a powerful monarchy. 25 
The myriads of Turkish horse overspread a frontier of six hundred miles 
from Tauris to Arzeroum, and the blood of one hundred and thirty thou- 
sand Christians was a grateful sacrifice to the Arabian prophet. Yet the 
arms of Togrul did not make any deep or lasting impression on the Greek 
empire. The torrent rolled away from the open country; the sultan 
retired without glory or success from the siege of an Armenian city; the 
obscure hostilities were continued or suspended with a vicissitude of 
events; and the bravery of the Macedonian legions renewed the fame oi 
the conqueror of Asia. 26 The name of Alp Arslan, the valiant lion, is

histories of Zonaras and Cedrenus, Scylitzes the continuator of Cedrenus

two latter statesmen; yet such were the Greeks, that the difference of 
style and character is scarcely discernible. For the Orientals, I draw as 
usual on the wealth of D'Herbelot (see titles of the first Seljukides) and 
the accuracy of De Guignes (Hist, des Huns, torn. iii. 1. x.).

expressive of the popular idea of the perfection of man; and the suc- 
cessor of Togrul displayed the fierceness and generosity of the royal 
animal. He passed the Euphrates at the head of the Turkish cavalry, 
ind entered Csesarea, the metropolis of Cappadocia, to which he had 
been attracted by the fame and wealth of the temple of St. Basil. The 
solid structure resisted the destroyer: but he carried away the doors of 
the shrine incrusted with gold and pearls, and profaned the relics of the 
tutelar saint, whose mortal frailties were now covered by the venerable 
rust of antiquity. The final conquest of Armenia and Georgia was 
achieved by Alp Arslan. In Armenia, the title of a kingdom, and the 
spirit of a nation, were annihilated: the artificial fortifications were 
yielded by the mercenaries of Constantinople; by strangers without 
faith, veterans without pay or arms, and recruits without experience or 
discipline. The loss of this important frontier was the news of a day: 
and the Catholics were neither surprised nor displeased that a people so 
deeply infected with the Nestorian and Eutychian errors had been de- 
livered by Christ and his mother into the hands of the infidels. 27 The 
woods and valleys of Mount Caucasus were more strenuously defended 
by the native Georgians, 28 or Iberians: but the Turkish sultan and his 
son Malek were indefatigable in this holy war: their captives were com- 
pelled to promise a spiritual, as well as temporal, obedience; and, in- 
stead of their collars and bracelets, an iron horse-shoe, a badge of ig- 
nominy, was imposed on the infidels who still adhered to the worship of 
their fathers. The change, however, was not sincere or universal; and, 
through ages of servitude, the Georgians have maintained the succession 
of their princes and bishops. But a race of men whom Nature has cast 
in her most perfect mould is degraded by poverty, ignorance, and vice; 
their profession, and still more their practice, of Christianity is an empty 
name; and if they have emerged from heresy, it is only because they are 
too illiterate to remember a metaphysical creed. 29 

The false or genuine magnanimity of Mahmud the Gaznevide was 
not imitated by Alp Arslan; and he attacked without scruple the Greek

empress Eudocia and her children. His alarming progress compelled 
her to give herself and her sceptre to the hand of a soldier; and Ro- 
manus Diogenes was invested with the Imperial purple. His patriotism, 
and perhaps his pride, urged him from Constantinople within two months 
after his accession; and the next campaign he most scandalously took 
the field during the holy festival of Easter. In the palace, Diogenes 
was no more than the husband of Eudocia: in the camp, he was the 
emperor of the Romans, and he sustained that character with feeble 
resources and invincible courage. By his spirit and success, the soldiers 
were taught to act, the subjects to hope, and the enemies to fear. The 
Turks had penetrated into the heart of Phrygia; but the sultan himself 
had resigned to his emirs the prosecution of the war; and their numerous 
detachments were scattered over Asia in the security of conquest. La- 
den with spoil, and careless of discipline, they were separately surprised 
and defeated by the Greeks: the activity of the emperor seemed to 
multiply his presence; and while they heard of his expedition to Anti- 
och, the enemy felt his sword on the hills of Trebizond. In three labori- 
ous campaigns the Turks were driven beyond the Euphrates: in the 
fourth and last, Romanus undertook the deliverance of Armenia. The 
desolation of the land obliged him to transport a supply of two months' 
provisions; and he marched forwards to the siege of Malazkerd, 80 an 
important fortress in the midway between the modern cities of Arzeroum 
and Van. His army amounted, at the least, to one hundred thousand 
men. The troops of Constantinople were reinforced by the disorderly 
multitudes of Phrygia and Cappadocia; but the real strength was com- 
posed of the subjects and allies of Europe, the legions of Macedonia, and 
the squadrons of Bulgaria; the Uzi, a Moldavian horde, who were them- 
selves of the Turkish race; 31 and, above all, the mercenary and adven- 
turous bands of French and Normans. Their lances were commanded 
by the valiant Ursel of Baliol, the kinsman or father of the Scottish 

80 This city is mentioned by Constantine Porphyrogenitus (de Administrat.

of the eleventh century, tinder the name of Mantzikierte, and by some is 
confounded with Theodpsiopolis ; but Delisle, in his notes and maps, has very 
properly fixed the situation. Abulfeda (Geograph. tab. xviii. p. 310) describes 
Malasgerd as a small town, built with black stone, supplied with water, 
without trees, etc.

are the Gozz of the Orientals (Hist, des Huns, torn. ii. p. 522; torn, iii, 
p. 133, etc.). They appear on the Danube and the Volga, in Armenia, 
Syria, and Chorasan, and the name seems to have been extended to the 
whole Turkman race. 

[The Uzi were the people who were afterwards called Cumani or Comani 
by the Byzantine writers. They were a Turkish race, allied in some respects 
to the Patzinaks. They are mentioned by Constantine Porphyrogenitus as 
living in his time beyond the Khazars and the Patzinaks. They first appeared 
in Russia in 1055. Then they drove the Patzinaks out of Atelkuzu, the land 
of which the latter had formerly dispossessed the Hungarians into Wallachia.

kings, 32 and were allowed to excel in the exercise of arms, or, according 
to the Greek stylo, in the practice of the Pyrrhic dance. 

On the report of this bold invasion, which threatened his hereditary 
dominions, Alp Arslan flew to the scene of action at the head of forty 
thousand horse. 38 His rapid and skilful evolutions distressed and dis- 
mayed the superior numbers of the Greeks; and in the defeat of Basil- 
aciuSj one of their principal generals, he displayed the first example of 
his valour and clemency. The imprudence of the emperor has separated 
his forces after the reduction of Malazkerd. It was in vain that he 
attempted to recall the mercenary Franks: they refused to obey his 
summons; he disdained to await their return: the desertion of the Uzi 
filled his mind with anxiety and suspicion; and against the most salu- 
tary advice he rushed forwards to speedy and decisive action. Had he 
listened to the fair proposals of the sultan, Romanus might have secured 
a, retreat, perhaps a peace; but in these overtures he supposed the fear 
or weakness of the enemy, and his answer was conceived in the tone of 
insult and defiance. " If the barbarian wishes for peace, let him evacu- 
ate the ground which he occupies for the encampment of the Romans, 
and surrender his city and palace of Rei as a pledge of his sincerity." 
Alp Arslan smiled at the vanity of the demand, but he wept the death 
of so many faithful Moslems; and after a devout prayer, proclaimed a 
free permission to all who were desirous of retiring from the field. With 
his own hands he tied up his horse's tail, exchanged his bow and arrows 
for a mace and scimitar, clothed himself in a white garment, perfumed 
his body with musk, and declared that, if he were vanquished, that spot 
should be the place of his burial. 34 The sultan himself had affected to 
cast away his missile weapons; but his hopes of victory were placed in 
the arrows of the Turkish cavalry, whose squadrons were loosely dis- 
tributed in the form of a crescent. Instead of the successive lines and 
reserves of the Grecian tactics, Romanus led his army in a single and 
solid phalanx, and pressed with vigour and impatience the artful and 
yielding resistance of the barbarians. In this desultory and fruitless 
combat he wasted the greater part of a summers day, till prudence and 
fatigue compelled him to return to his camp. But a retreat is always 
perilous in the face of an active foe; and no sooner had the standard 

"Urselius [Urselhis] (the Russelras of Zonaras) is distinguished by Jeffrey 
Malaterra (1. ii. c. 33) among the Norman conquerors of Sicily, and with

came from Normandy to Durham, built Bernard's castle on the Tees, 
married an heiress of Scotland, etc. Ducange (Not. ad Nicephor. Bryennium,

whose father had exchanged the sword for the gown.

by Abulpharagius to 15,000 (p. 227), and by D'Herbelot (p. 102) to 12,000 
horse. But the same Elmacin gives 300,000 men to the emperor, of whom 
Abulpharagius says, Cum centum hominum millibus, multisque equis et 
magna pompa instructus. The Greeks abstain from any definition of numbers.

sultan; he committed his forces to a eunuch, had retired to a distance, etc.

THE ROMAN EMPIRE 403 

been turned to the rear than the phalanx was broken by the base cow- 
ardice, or the baser jealousy, of Andronicus, a rival prince, who dis- 
graced his birth and the purple of the Caesars. 35 The Turkish squad- 
rons poured a cloud of arrows on this moment of confusion and lassitude; 
and the horns of their formidable crescent were closed in the rear of 
the Greeks. In the destruction of the army and pillage of the camp, it 
would be needless to mention the number of the slain or captives. The 
Byzantine writers^ deplore the loss of an inestimable pearl: they forget 
to mention, that in this fatal day the Asiatic provinces of Rome were 
irretrievably sacrificed. 

As long as a hope survived, Romanus attempted to rally and save 
the relics of his army. When the centre, the Imperial station, was left 
naked on all sides, and encompassed by the victorious Turks, he still, 
with desperate courage, maintained the fight till the dose of day, at the 
head of the brave and faithful subjects who adhered to his standard. 
They fell around him; his horse was slain; the emperor was wounded; 
yet he stood alone and intrepid till he was oppressed and bound by the 
strength of multitudes. The glory of this illustrious prize was disputed 
by a slave and a soldier; a slave who had seen him on the throne of 
Constantinople, and a soldier whose extreme deformity had been ex- 
cused on the promise of some signal service. Despoiled of his arms, 
his jewels, and his purple, Romanus spent a dreary and perilous night 
on the field of battle, amidst a disorderly crowd of the meaner bar- 
barians. In the morning the royal captive was presented to Alp Arslan, 
who doubted of his fortune, till the identity of the person was as- 
certained by the report of his ambassadors, and by the more pa- 
thetic evidence of Basilacius, who embraced with tears the feet of his 
unhappy sovereign. The successor of Constantine, in a plebeian habit, 
was led into the Turkish divan and commanded to kiss the ground be- 
fore the lord of Asia, He reluctantly obeyed; and Alp Arslan, starting 
from his throne, it said to have planted his foot on the neck of the 
Roman emperor. 80 But the fact is doubtful; and if, in this moment of 
insolence, the sultan complied with the national custom, the rest of his 
conduct has extorted the praise of his bigoted foes, and may afford a 
lesson to the most civilised ages. He instantly raised the royal captive 
from the ground; and thrice clasping his hand with tender sympathy, 
assured him that his life and dignity should be inviolate in the hands 
of a prince who had learned to respect the majesty of his equals and the 
vicissitudes of fortune. From the divan Romanus was conducted to 
an adjacent tent, where he was served with pomp and reverence by the 
officers of the sultan, who, twice each day, seated him in the place of

honour at his own table. In a free and familiar conversation of eight 
days, not a word, not a look, of insult escaped from the conqueror; but 
he severely censured the unworthy subjects who had deserted their 
valiant prince in the hour of danger, and gently admonished his antag- 
onist of some errors which he had committed in the management of the 
war. In the preliminaries of negotiation Alp Arslan asked him what 
treatment he expected to receive, and the calm indifference of the em- 
peror displays the freedom of bis mind. " If you are cruel," said he, 
" you will take my life; if you listen to pride, you will drag me at your 
chariot wheels; if you consult your interest, you will accept a ransom 
and restore me to my country." " And what," continued the sultan, 
"would have been your own behaviour had fortune smiled on your 
arms? " The reply of the Greek betrays a sentiment which prudence, 
and even gratitude, should have taught him to suppress. " Had I van- 
quished," he fiercely said, " I would have inflicted on thy body many 
a stripe." The Turkish conqueror smiled at the insolence of his captive; 
observed that the Christian law inculcated the love of enemies and for- 
giveness of injuries; and nobly declared that he would not imitate an 
example which he condemned. After mature deliberation, Alp Arslan 
dictated the terms of liberty and peace, a ransom of a million, an annual 
tribute of three hundred and sixty thousand pieces of gold, 37 the mar- 
riage of the royal children, and the deliverance of all the Moslems who 
were in the power of the Greeks. Romanus, with a sigh, subscribed 
this treaty, so disgraceful to the majesty of the empire: he was imme- 
diately invested with a Turkish robe of honour; his nobles and patri- 
cians were restored to their sovereign; and the sultan, after a courteous 
embrace, dismissed him with rich presents and a military guard. No 
sooner did he reach the confines of the empire than he was informed 
that the palace and provinces had disclaimed their allegiance to a cap- 
tive; a sum of two hundred thousand pieces was painfully collected; 
and the fallen monarch transmitted this part of his ransom, with a sad 
confession of his impotence and disgrace. The generosity, or perhaps

THE ROMAN EMPIRE 405 

In the treaty of peace it does not appear that Alp Arslan extorted 
any province or city from the captive emperor; and his revenge was 
satisfied with the trophies of his victory, and the spoils of Anatolia, 
from Antioch to the Black Sea. The fairest part of Asia was subject 
to his laws: twelve hundred princes, or the sons of princes, stood be- 
fore his throne; and two hundred thousand soldiers marched under 
his banners. The sultan disdained to pursue the fugitive Greeks; 
but he meditated the more glorious conquest of Turkestan, the original 
seat of the house of Seljuk. He moved from Bagdad to the banks of 
the Oxus; a bridge was thrown over the river; and twenty days were 
consumed in the passage of his troops. But the progress of the great 
king was retarded by the governor of Berzem; and Joseph the Cariz- 
mian presumed to defend his fortress against the powers of the East. 
When he was produced a captive in the royal tent, the sultan, in- 
stead of praising his valour, severely reproached his obstinate folly; 
and the insolent replies of the rebel provoked a sentence, that he should 
be fastened to four stakes and left to expire in that painful situation. 
At this command the desperate Carizmian, drawing a dagger, rushed 
headlong towards the throne: the guards raised their battle-axes; their 
zeal was checked by Alp Arslan, the most skilful archer of the age: 
he drew his bow, but his foot slipped, the arrow glanced aside, and he 
received in his breast the dagger of Joseph, who was instantly cut in 
pieces. The wound was mortal; and the Turkish prince bequeathed 
a dying admonition to the pride of kings. " In my youth," said Alp 
Arslan, " I was advised by a sage to humble myself before God; to 
distrust my own strength; and never to despise the most contemptible 
foe. I have neglected these lessons; and my neglect has been de- 
servedly punished. Yesterday, as from an eminence I beheld the 
numbers, the discipline, and the spirit of my armies, the earth seemed 
to tremble under my feet; and I said in my heart, Surely thou art 
the king of the world, the greatest and most invincible of warriors. 
These armies are no longer mine; and, in the confidence of my per- 
sonal strength, I now fall by the hand of an assassin." ** Alp Arslan 
possessed lie virtues of a Turk and a Musulman; his voice and sta- 
ture commanded the reverence of mankind; his face was shaded with 
long whiskers; and his ample turban was fashioned in the shape of a 
crown. The remains of the sultan were deposited in the tomb of the 
Seljukian dynasty; and the passenger might read and meditate this 
useful inscription:* " O YE WHO HAVE SEEN THE GLORY OF ALP ARS- 
LAN EXALTED TO THE HEAVENS, REPAIR TO MARU, AND YOU WILL BE- 
HOLD IT BURIED IN THE DUST." The annihilation of the inscription, 

89 This interesting death is told by D'Herbelot (p. 103, 104) and M. de 
Guignes (torn. iii. p. 212, 213), from their Oriental writers; but neither of 
them have transfused the spirit of Elmacin (Hist. Saracen, p. 344, 345). 

40 A critic of high renown (the kte Dr. Johnson), who has severely 
scrutinised the epitaphs of Pope, might cavil in this sublime inscription at 
the words "repair to Maru," since the reader must already be at Mara 
before he could peruse the inscription. 



^ 406 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

and the tomb itself, more forcibly proclaims the instability of human 
greatness. 

During the life of Alp Arslan his eldest son had been acknowledged 
as the future sultan of the Turks. On his father's death the inheri- 
tance was disputed by an uncle, a cousin, and a brother: they drew 
their scimitars and assembled their followers; and the triple victory of 
Malek Shah 41 established his own reputation and the right of primo- 
geniture. In every age, and more especially in Asia, the thirst of 
power has inspired the same passions and occasioned the same dis- 
orders; but, from the long series of civil war, it would not be easy to 
extract a sentiment more pure and magnanimous than is contained in 
a saying of the Turkish prince. On the eve of the battle he per- 
formed his devotions at Thous, before the tomb of the Imam Riza. As 
the sultan rose from the ground he asked his vizir, Nizam, who had 
knelt beside him, what had been the object of his secret petition: 
:t That your arms may be crowned with victory," was the prudent, and 
most probably the sincere, answer of the minister. " For my part," 
replied the generous Malek, " I implored the Lord of hosts that he 
would take from me my life and crown, if my brother be more worthy 
than myself to reign over the Moslems." The favourable judgment 
of Heaven was ratified by the caliph; and for the first time the sacred 
title of Commander of the Faithful was communicated to a barbarian. 
But this barbarian, by his personal merit and the extent of his em- 
pire, was the greatest prince of his age. After the settlement of 
Persia and Syria he marched at the head of innumerable armies to 
achieve the conquest of Turkestan, which had been undertaken by his 
father. In his passage of the Oxus the boatmen, who had been em- 
ployed in transporting some troops, complained that their payment 
was assigned on the revenues of AntiocL The sultan frowned at this 
preposterous choice; but he smiled at the artful flattery of his vizir. 
" It was not to postpone their reward that I selected those remote 
places, but to leave a memorial to posterity, that, under your reign, 
Antioch^and the^Oxus were subject to the same sovereign." But this 
description of his limits was unjust and parsimonious: beyond the 
Oxus he reduced to his obedience the cities of Bochara, Carizme, and 
Samarcand, and crushed each rebellious slave or independent savage 
who dared to resist. Malek passed the Sihon or Jaxartes, the last 
boundary of Persian civilisation: the hordes of Turkestan yielded to 
his supremacy: his name was inserted on the coins and in the prayers 
of Cashgar, a Tartar kingdom on the extreme borders of China. From 
the Chinese frontier he stretched his immediate jurisdiction or feuda- 
tory sway to the west and south, as far as the mountains of Georgia 
the neighbourhood of Constantinople, the holy city of Jerusalem, and

the spicy groves of Arabia Felix. Instead of resigning himself to the 
luxury of his harem, the shepherd king, both in peace and war, was in 
action and in the field. By the perpetual motion of the royal camp 
each province was successively blessed with his presence; and he is 
said to have perambulated twelve times the wide extent of his do- 
minions, which surpassed the Asiatic reign of Cyrus and the caliphs, 
Of these expeditions the most pious and splendid was the pilgrimage 
of Mecca: the freedom and safety of the caravans were protected by 
his arms; the citizens and pilgrims were enriched by the profusion 
of his alms; and the desert was cheered by the places of relief and 
refreshment which he instituted for the use of his brethren. Hunting 
was the pleasure, and even the passion, of the sultan, and his train 
consisted of forty-seven thousand horses; but after the massacre of a 
Turkish chase, for each piece of game he bestowed a piece of gold on 
the poor, a slight atonement, at the expense of the people, for the 
cost and mischief of the amusement of kings. In the peaceful prosperity 
of his reign the cities of Asia were adorned with palaces and hospitals, 
with moschs and colleges: few departed from his divan without reward s 
and none without justice. The language and literature of Persia re- 
vived under the house of Seljuk; 42 and if Malek emulated the liberal- 
ity of a Turk less potent than himself, 43 his palace might resound with 
the songs of a hundred poets. The sultan bestowed a more serious and 
learned care on the reformation of the calendar, which was affected by 
a general assembly of the astronomers of the East. By a law of the 
prophet the Moslems are confined to the irregular course of the lunar 
months; in Persia, since the age of Zoroaster, the revolution of the sun 
has been known and celebrated as an annual festival; 44 but after the 
fall of the Magian empire, the intercalation had been neglected; the 
fractions of minutes and hours wore multiplied into days; and the 
date of the spring was removed from the sign of Aries to that of Pisces. 
The reign of Malek was illustrated by the Gelal&amp;an era; and all errors, 
either past or future, were corrected by a computation of time, which 
surpasses the Julian, and approaches the accuracy of the Gregorian, 
style. 45 

42 See an excellent discourse at the end of Sir William Jones's History of 
Nadir Shah, and the articles of the poets Amak, Anvari, Raschidi, etc., in 
the Bibliotheque Orientale. 

43 His name was Kheder Khan. Four bags were placed round his sofa, 
and, as he listened to the song, he cast handfuls of gold and silver to the 
poets (D'Herbelot, p. 107). All this may be true; but I do not under- 
stand how he could reign in Transoxiana in the time of Malek Shah, and 
much less how Kheder could surpass him in power and pomp. I suspect 
that the beginning, not the end, of the eleventh century is the true era of 
his reign.

or titles of Malek Shah) is fixed to the fifteenth of March, A.H. 471 A.D.

4 o8 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

In a period when Europe was plunged in the deepest barbarism, the 
light and splendour of Asia may be ascribed to the docility rather 
than the knowledge of the Turkish conquerors. An ample share of 
their wisdom and virtue is due to a Persian vizir, who ruled the em- 
pire under the reigns of Alp Arslan and his son. Nizam, one of the 
most illustrious ministers of the East, was honoured by the caliph as 
an oracle of religion and science; he was trusted by the sultan as the 
faithful vicegerent of his power and justice. 46 After an administration 
of thirty years, the fame of the vizir, his wealth, and even his services, 
were transformed into crimes. He was overthrown by the insidious 
arts of a woman and a rival; and his fall was hastened by a rash 
declaration, that his cap and inkhorn, the badges of his office, were 
connected by the divine decree with the throne and diadem of the sul- 
tan. At the age of ninety-three years the venerable statesman was 
dismissed by his master, accused by his enemies, and murdered by a 
fanatic: the last words of Nizam attested his innocence, and the re- 
mainder of Malek's life was short and inglorious. From Ispahan, the 
scene of this disgraceful transaction, the sultan moved to Bagdad, with 
the design of transplanting the caliph, and of fixing his own residence 
in the capital of the Moslem world. The feeble successor of Mo- 
hammed obtained a respite of ten days; and before the expiration of 
the term the barbarian was summoned by the angel of death. His 
ambassadors at Constantinople had asked in marriage a Roman prin- 
cess; but the proposal was decently eluded, and the daughter of 
Alexius, who might herself have been the victim, expresses her abhor- 
rence of this unnatural conjunction.* 7 The daughter of the sultan was 
bestowed on the caliph Moctadi, with the imperious condition that, re- 
nouncing the society of his wives and concubines, he should for ever 
confine himself to this honourable alliance. 

The greatness and unity of the Turkish empire expired in the per- 
son of Malek Shah. His vacant throne was disputed by his brother and 
his four sons; and, after a series of civil wars, the treaty which recon- 
ciled the surviving candidates confirmed a lasting separation in the 
Persian dynasty, the eldest and principal branch of the house of Seljuk. 
The three younger dynasties were those of Kerman, of Syria, and of 
Roum: the first of these commanded an extensive, though obscure,* 8 

" [Nizam-al-Mulk, the vizier of Malek Shah, was himself a writer and 
left the Siasset Nameh or Book of Government, which has been published 
with a translation by Schefer. As Mr. Stanley Lane Poole says in his 
Saladin, it casts a flood of light on the events of the time, and shows us 
how the Seljuks were already changing under the influence of Iranian 
civilisation and Islamism. 0. S.]

Anna Comnena was only nine years old at the end of the reign of Malek 
Shah (A.D. 1092), and when she speaks of his assassination she confounds 
the sultan with the vizir (Alexias, L vi. p. 177, 178 [torn. i. p. 314-317, ed. 
Bonn]).

dominion on the shores of the Indian Ocean;* 8 the second expelled the 
Arabian princes of Aleppo and Damascus; and the third, our peculiar 
care, invaded the Roman provinces of Asia Minor. The generous policy 
of Malek contributed to their elevation: he allowed the princes of his 
blood, even those whom he had vanquished in the field, to seek new 
kingdoms worthy of their ambition; nor was he displeased that they 
should draw away the more ardent spirits who might have disturbed 
the tranquillity of his reign. As the supreme head of his family and 
nation, the great sultan of Persia commanded the obedience and tribute 
of his royal brethren: the thrones of Kerman and Nice, of Aleppo and 
Damascus, the Atabeks and emirs of Syria and Mesopotamia, erected 
their standards under the shadow of his sceptre: 50 and the hordes of 
Turkmans overspread the plains of the Western Asia. After the death 
of Malek the bands of union and subordination were relaxed and 
finally dissolved: the indulgence of the house of Seljuk invested their 
slaves with the inheritance of kingdoms; and, in the Oriental style, a 
crowd of princes arose from the dust of their feet. 51 

A prince of the royal line, Cutulmish, the son of Izrail, the son of 
Seljuk, had fallen in a battle against Alp Arslan: and the humane vic- 
tor had dropped a tear over his grave. His five sons, strong in arms, 
ambitious of power, and eager for revenge, unsheathed their scimitars 
against the son of Alp Arslan. The two armies expected the signal, 
when the caliph, forgetful of the majesty which seduded him from 
vulgar eyes, interposed his venerable mediation. " Instead of shedding 
the blood of your brethren, your brethren both in descent and faith, 
unite your forces in a holy war against the Greeks, the enemies of 
God and his apostle." They listened to his voice; the sultan embraced 
his rebellious kinsmen; and the eldest, the valiant Soliman, accepted 
the royal standard, which gave him the free conquest and hereditary 
command of the provinces of the Roman empire, from Arzeroum to 
Constantinople and the unknown regions of the West. 52 Accompanied

the capital as a great ruinous village, twenty-five days' journey from 
Ispahan, and twenty-seven from Ormus, in the midst of a fertile country 
(Voyages en Turquie et en Perse, p. 107, no). 

80 It appears from Anna Comnena that the Turks of Asia Minor obeyed 
the signet and chiauss of the great sultan (Alexias, 1. vi. p. 170 [torn. L p. 302, 
ed. Bonn]), and that the two sons of Soliman were detained in his court 

*This expression is quoted by Petit de la Croix (Vie de Gengiscan, p. 161) 
from some poet, most probably a Persian. 

M On the conquest of Asia Minor, M. de Guignes has derived no assistance 
from the Turkish or Arabian writers, who produce a naked list of the Sel- 
jukides of Roum. The Greeks are unwilling to expose their shame, and 
we must extort some hints from Scylitzes (p. 860, 863 [p. 731, 736, ed. 
Bonn]), Nicephorus Bryennius (p. 88, 91, 92, etc., 103, 104 [p. 130, 130, 
sqq., 158 sqq., ed. Bonn]), and Anna Comnena (Alexias, p. 91, 92, etc., 168, 
etc. [torn. i. p. 169, sqq., 299, sqq.,' td. Bonn]).

by his four brothers, he passed the Euphrates: the Turkish camp was 
soon seated in the neighbourhood of Kutaieh in Phrygia; and his flying 
cavalry laid waste the country as far as the Hellespont and the Black 
Sea. Since the decline of the empire the peninsula of Asia Minor had 
been exposed to the transient though destructive inroads of the Per- 
sians and Saracens; but the fruits of a lasting conquest were reserved 
for the Turkish sultan; and his arms were introduced by the Greeks, 
who aspired to reign on the ruins of their country. Since the captivity 
of Romanus, six years the feeble son of Eudocia had trembled under 
the weight of the Imperial crown, till the provinces of the East and 
West were lost in the same month by a double rebellion: of either 
chief Nicephorus was the common name; but the surnames of Bryen- 
nius and Botoniates distinguish the European and Asiatic candidates. 
Their reasons, or rather their promises, were weighed in the divan; and, 
after some hesitation, Solimaji declared himself in favour of Botoniates, 
opened a free passage to his troops in their march from Antioch to 
Nice, and joined the banner of the crescent to that of the cross. After 
his ally had ascended the throne of Constantinople, the sultan was hos- 
pitably entertained in the suburb of Chrysopolis or Scutari; and a body 
of two thousand Turks was transported into Europe, to whose dex- 
terity and courage the new emperor was indebted for the defeat and 
captivity of his rival Bryennius. But the conquest of Europe was 
dearly purchased by the sacrifice of Asia; Constantinople was deprived 
of the obedience and revenue of the provinces beyond the Bosphorus 
and Hellespont; and the regular progress of the Turks, who fortified 
the passes of the rivers and mountains, left not a hope of their retreat 
or expulsion. Another candidate implored the aid of the sultan: Me- 
lissenus, in his purple robes and red buskins, attended the motions of 
the Turkish camp; and the desponding cities were tempted by the 
summons of a Roman prince, who immediately surrendered them into 
the hands of the barbarians. These acquisitions were confirmed by a 
treaty of peace with the emperor Alexius; his fear of Robert compelled 
him to seek the friendship of Soliman; and it was not till after the 
sultan's death that he extended as far as Nicomedia, about sixty miles 
from Constantinople, the eastern boundary of the Roman world. 
Trebizond alone, defended on either side by the sea and mountains, 
preserved at the extremity of the Euxine the ancient character of a 
Greek colony, and the future destiny of a Christian empire. 

Since the first conquests of the caliphs, the establishment of the 
Turks in Anatolia or Asia Minor was the most deplorable loss which 
the church and empire had sustained. By the propagation of the Mos- 
lem faith, Soliman deserved the name of Gazi, a holy champion; and 
his new kingdom of the Romans, or of Roum, was added to the tables 
of Oriental geography. It is described as extending from the Euphrates 
to Constantinople, from the Black Sea to the confines of Syria; preg- 
nant with mines of sflver and iron, of alum and copper, fruitful in corn

and wine, and productive of cattle and excellent horses. 53 The wealth 
of Lydia, the arts of the Greeks, the splendour of the Augustan age, 
existed only in books and ruins, which were equally obscure, in the 
eyes of the Scythian conquerors. Yet in the present decay Anatolia 
still contains some wealthy and populous cities; and, under the Byzan- 
tine empire, they were far more flourishing in numbers, size, and opu- 
lence. By the choice of the sultan, Nice, the metropolis of Bithynia, 
was preferred for his palace and fortress: the seat of the Seljukiaii 
dynasty of Roum was planted one hundred miles from Constantinople: 
and the divinity of Christ was denied and derided in the same temple 
in which it had been pronounced by the first general synod of the 
Catholics. The unity of God, and the mission of Mohammed, were 
preached in the moschs; the Arabian learning was taught in the 
schools; the Cadhis judged according to the law of the Koran; the 
Turkish manners and language prevailed in the cities; and Turkman 
camps were scattered over the plains and mountains of Anatolia, On 
the hard conditions of tribute and servitude, the Greek Christians 
might enjoy the exercise of their religion; but their most holy churches 
were profaned, their priests and bishops were insulted, 5 * they were com- 
pelled to suffer the triumph of the pagans and the apostacy of their 
brethren, many thousand children were marked by the knife of cir- 
cumcision, and many thousand captives were devoted to the sefrvice- 
or the pleasures of their masters. 05 After the loss of Asia, Antioch 
still maintained her primitive allegiance to Christ and Caesar; but the 
solitary province was separated from all Roman aid, and surrounded on 
all sides by the Mohammedan powers. The despair of Phflaretus the 
governor prepared the sacrifice of his religion and loyalty, had not his 
guilt been prevented by his son, who hastened to the Nicene palace,, 
and offered to deliver this valuable prize into the hands of Soliman. 
The ambitious sultan mounted on horseback, and in twelve nights (for 
he reposed in the day) performed a march of six hundred miles. Anti- 
och was oppressed by the speed and secrecy of his enterprise; and the 
dependent cities, as far as Laodicea and the confines of Aleppo, 56

history may be found in the collections of Ramusio and Bergeron (see

obeyed the example of the metropolis. From Laodicea to the Thra- 
cian Bosphorus, or arm of St. George, the conquests and reign of Soli- 
man extended thirty days' journey in length, and in breadth about ten 
or fifteen, between the rocks of Lycia and the Black Sea. 57 The Turk- 
ish ignorance of navigation protected for a while the inglorious safety 
of the emperor; but no sooner had a fleet of two hundred ships been 
constructed by the hands of the captive Greeks, than Alexius trem- 
bled behind the walls of his capital. His plaintive epistles were dis- 
persed over Europe to excite the compassion of the Latins, and to paint 
the danger, the weakness, and the riches of the city of Constantine. 58 
But tie most interesting conquest of the Seljukian Turks was that 
of Jerusalem, 59 which soon became the theatre of nations. In their 
capitulation with Omar, the inhabitants had stipulated the assurance 
of their religion and property, but the articles were interpreted by a 
master against whom it was dangerous to dispute; and in the four 
hundred years of the reign of the caliphs the political climate of Je- 
rusalem was exposed to the vicissitudes of storms and sunshine. 60 By 
the increase of proselytes and population the Mohammedans might 
excuse their usurpation of three-fourths of the city: but a peculiar 
quarter was reserved for the patriarch with his clergy and people; a 
tribute of two pieces of gold was the price of protection; and the sepul- 
chre of Christ, with the church of the Resurrection, was still left in the 
hands of his votaries. Of these votaries the most numerous and re- 
spectable portion were strangers to Jerusalem; the pilgrimages to the 
Holy Land had been stimulated, rather than suppressed, by the con- 
quest of the Arabs; and the enthusiasm which had always prompted 
these perilous journeys was nourished by the congenial passions of 
grief and indignation. A crowd of pilgrims from the East and West 
continued to visit the holy sepulchre and the adjacent sanctuaries, more 
especially at the festival of Easter; and the Greeks and Latins, the

beneath his character and dignity; yet it is approved by Ducange (Not

temporary historian. The Greek text no longer exists; and each trans-

Gesta ^ Dei per Francos. M. de Guignes has composed a very learned

is by no means contemptible; but in his account of 490 years, from the 
loss to the recovery of Jerusalem, he exceeds the true account by thirty years.

Nestorians and Jacobites, the Copts and Abyssinians, the Armenians 
and Georgians, maintained the chapels, the clergy, and the poor of 
their respective communions. The harmony of prayer in so many vari- 
ous tongues, the worship of so many nations in the common temple of 
their religion, might have afforded a spectacle of edification and peace; 
but the zeal of the Christian sects was embittered by hatred and re- 
venge; and in the kingdom of a suffering Messiah, who had pardoned 
his enemies, they aspired to command and persecute their spiritual 
brethren. The pre-eminence was asserted by the spirit and numbers 
of the Franks, and the greatness of Charlemagne 61 protected both 
the Latin pilgrims and the Catholics of the East. The poverty of 
Carthage, Alexandria, and Jerusalem was relieved by the alms of that 
pious emperor, and many monasteries of Palestine were founded or re- 
stored by his liberal devotion. Harun Alrashid, the greatest of the 
Abbassides, esteemed in his Christian brother a similar supremacy of 
genius and power: their friendship was cemented by a frequent inter- 
course of gifts and embassies; and the caliph, without resigning the 
substantial dominion, presented the emperor with the keys of the holy 
sepulchre, and perhaps of the city of Jerusalem. In the decline of the 
Carlovingian monarchy the republic of Amalphi promoted the interest 
of trade and religion in the East. Her vessels transported the Latin 
pilgrims to the coasts of Egypt and Palestine, and deserved, by their 
useful imports, the favour and alliance of the Fatimite caliphs: 62 an 
annual fair was instituted on Mount Calvary; and the Italian mer- 
chants founded the convent and hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, the 
cradle of the monastic and military order which has since reigned in the 
isles of Rhodes and of Malta. Had the Christian pilgrims been con- 
tent to revere the tomb of a prophet, the disciples of Mohammed, in- 
stead of blaming, would have imitated, their piety; but these rigid 
Unitarians were scandalised by a worship which represents the birth, 
death, and resurrection of a God; the Catholic images were branded 
with the name of idols; and the Moslems smiled with indignation 6S at 
the miraculous flame which was kindled on the eve of Easter in the 
holy sepulchre. 6 * This pious fraud, first devised in the ninth century, 65

was devoutly cherished by the Latin crusaders, and is annually re- 
peated by the clergy of the Greek, Armenian, and Coptic sects, 66 who 
impose on the credulous spectators 7 for their own benefit and that of 
their tyrants. In every age a principle of toleration has been fortified 
by a sense of interest, and the revenue of the prince and his emir 
was increased each year by the expense and tribute of so many thou- 
sand strangers. 

The revolution which transferred the sceptre from the Abbassides to 
the Fatimites was a benefit rather than an injury to the Holy Land. 
A sovereign resident in Egypt was more sensible of the importance 
of Christian trade; and the emirs of Palestine were less remote from 
the justice and power of the throne. But the third of these Fatimite 
caliphs was the famous Hakem, 68 a frantic youth, who was delivered 
by his impiety and despotism from the fear either of God or man, and 
whose reign was a wild mixture of vice and folly. Regardless of the 
most ancient customs of Egypt, he imposed on the women an absolute 
confinement; the restraint excited the clamours of both sexes; their 
clamours provoked his fury; a part of Old Cairo was delivered to the 
flames, and the guards and citizens were engaged many days in a 
bloody conflict. At first the caliph declared himself a zealous Musul- 
man 3 the founder or benefactor of moschs and colleges: twelve hun- 
dred and ninety copies of the Koran were transcribed at his expense 
in letters of gold, and his edict extirpated the vineyards of the Upper 
Egypt. But his vanity was soon flattered by the hope of introducing 
a new religion; he aspired above the fame of a prophet, and styled 
himself the visible image of the Most High God, who, after nine appa- 
ritions on earth, was at length manifest in his royal person. At the 
name of Hakem, the lord of the living and the dead, every knee was 
bent in religious adoration; his mysteries were performed on a moun- 
tain near Cairo; sixteen thousand converts had signed his profession 
of faith; and at the present hour a free and warlike people, the Druses 
of Mount Libanus, are persuaded of the life and divinity of a madman 
and tyrant. 6 * In his divine character Hakem hated the Jews and 

monk Bernard, an eye-witness, who visited Jerusalem A.D. 870. The miracle 
is confirmed by another pilgrim some years older; and Mosheim ascribes 
the invention to the Franks soon after the decease of Charlemagne. 

*Our travellers, Sandys (p. 134), Thevenot (p. 621-627), Maundrell 
(P- 94, 95), etc., describe this extravagant farce. The Catholics are puzzled 
to decide when the miracle ended and the trick began. 

"The Orientals themselves confess the fraud, and plead necessity and 
edification (Memoires du Chevalier D'Arvieux, torn. ii. p. 140;, Joseph

explain the mode. Our travellers have failed with the blood of St Janu- 
arius at Naples.

Christians, as the servants of his rivals, while some remains of preju- 
dice or prudence still pleaded in favour of the law of Mohammed. 
Both in Egypt and Palestine his cruel and wanton persecution made 
some martyrs and many apostates; the common rights and special 
privileges of the sectaries were equally disregarded, and a general in- 
terdict was kid on the devotion of strangers and natives. The temple 
of the Christian world, the church of the Resurrection, was demolished 
to its foundations; the luminous prodigy of Easter was interrupted; 
and much profane labour was exhausted to destroy the cave in the 
rock which properly constitutes the holy sepulchre. At the report of 
this sacrilege the nations of Europe were astonished and afflicted; but. 
instead of arming in the 'defence of the Holy Land, they contented 
themselves with burning or banishing the Jews, as the secret advisers 
of the impious barbarian; 70 Yet the calamities of Jerusalem were in 
some measure alleviated by the inconstancy or repentance of Hakem 
himself; and the royal mandate was sealed for the restitution of the 
churches when the tyrant was assassinated by the emissaries of his 
sister. The succeeding caliphs resumed the maxims of religion and 
policy: a free toleration was again granted; with the pious aid of the 
emperor of Constantinople the holy sepulchre arose from its ruins; 
and, after a short abstinence, the pilgrims returned with an increase 
of appetite to the spiritual feast. 71 In the sea-voyage of Palestine the- 
dangers were frequent, and the opportunities rare; but the conversion 
of Hungary opened a safe communication between Germany and 
Greece. The charity of St. Stephen, the apostle of his kingdom, re- 
lieved and conducted his itinerant brethren; 72 and from Belgrade to 
Antioch they traversed fifteen hundred miles of a Christian empire. 
Among the Franks the zeal of pilgrimage prevailed beyond the ex- 
ample of former times, and the roads were covered with multitudes 
of either sex and of every rank, who professed their contempt of life 

life; and the vulgar Druses, the most indifferent of men, occasionally con- 
form to the worship of the Mohammedans and Christians of their neighbour- 
hood. The little that is, or deserves to be known, may be seen in the 
industrious Niebuhr (Voyages, torn. ii. p. 354-357), and the second volume 
of the recent and instructive Travels of M. de Volney. 

[The religion of the Druses has been fully examined in the erudite work 
of M. Silvestre de Sacy, two vols., Paris, 1838. This has been largely 
superseded by a very able treatise by the Rev. W. Ewing, M.A., of Edin- 
burgh, Arab and Druse at Home (Jack, Edinburgh, 1907). The account 
of Hakem Biamr-Allah enables us to correct several errors in the account 
which Gibbon gives. This man has been revered by the Druses as their 
spiritual leader for upwards of 800 years. 0. S.]

so soon as they should have kissed the tomb of their Redeemer. Princes 
and prelates abandoned the care of their dominions, and the numbers, 
of these pious caravans were a prelude to the armies which marched 
in the ensuing age under the banner of the cross. About thirty years 
before the first crusade, the archbishop of Mentz, with the bishops of 
Utrecht, Bamberg, and Ratisbon, undertook this laborious journey 
from the Rhine to the Jordan, and the multitude of their followers 
amounted to seven thousand persons. 

At Constantinople they were hospitably entertained by the emperor, 
but the ostentation of their wealth provoked the assault of the wild 
Arabs; they drew their swords with scrupulous reluctance, and sus- 
tained a siege in the village of Capernaum till they were rescued by the 
venal protection of the Fatimite emir. After visiting the holy places 
they embarked for Italy, but only a remnant of two thousand arrived 
in safety in their native land. Ingulphus, a secretary of William the 
Conqueror, was a companion of this pilgrimage; he observes that they 
sallied from Normandy thirty stout and well-appointed horsemen; 
but that they repassed the Alps twenty miserable palmers, with the 
staff in their hand, and the wallet at their back. 73 

After the defeat of the Romans the tranquillity of the Fatimite 
caliphs was invaded by the Turks. 74 One of the lieutenants of Malek 
Shah, Atsiz the Carizmian, marched into Syria at the head of a power- 
ful army, and reduced Damascus by famine and the sword. Hems, 
and the other cities of the province, acknowledged the caliph of Bag- 
dad and the sultan of Persia; and the victorious emir advanced with- 
out resistance to the banks of the Nile: the Fatimite was preparing to 
fiy into the heart of Africa; but the negroes of his guard and the in- 
habitants of Cairo made a desperate sally, and repulsed the Turk from 
the confines of Egypt. In his retreat he indulged the licence of slaugh- 
ter and rapine: the judge and notaries of Jerusalem were invited to his 
camp; and their execution was followed by the massacre of three thou- 
sand citizens. The cruelty or the defeat of Atsiz was soon punished by 
the sultan Toucush, the brother of Malek Shah, who, with a higher 
title and more formidable powers, asserted the dominion of Syria and 
Palestine. The house of Sdjuk reigned about twenty years in Je- 
rusalem; 75 but the hereditary command of the holy city and territory

was intrusted or abandoned to the emir Ortok, the chief of a tribe of 
Turkmans, whose children, after their expulsion from Palestine, formed 
two Dynasties on the borders of Armenia and Assyria. 76 The Oriental 
Christians and the Latin pilgrims deplored a revolution which, instead 
of the regular government and old alliance of the caliphs, imposed on 
their necks the iron yoke of the strangers of the North. 77 In his court 
and camp the great sultan had adopted in some degree the arts and 
manners of Persia; but the body of the Turkish nation, and more espe- 
cially the pastoral tribes, still breathed the fierceness of the desert. 
From Nice to Jerusalem the western countries of Asia were a scene of 
foreign and domestic hostility; and the shepherds of Palestine, who 
held a precarious sway on a doubtful frontier, had neither leisure nor 
capacity to await the slow profits of commercial and religious freedom. 
The pilgrims, who, through innumerable perils, had reached the gates 
of Jerusalem, were the victims of private rapine or public oppression, 
and often sunk under the pressure of famine and disease, before they 
were permitted to salute the holy sepulchre. A spirit of native bar- 
barism, or recent zeal, prompted the Turkmans to insult the clergy of 
every sect: the patriarch was dragged by the hair along the pavement 
and cast into a dungeon, to extort a ransom from the sympathy of his 
flock; and the divine worship in the church of the Resurrection was 
often disturbed by the savage rudeness of its masters. The pathetic 
tale excited the millions of the West to march under the standard of 
the cross to the relief of the Holy Land; and yet how trifling is the 
sum of these accumulated evils, if compared with the single act of the 
sacrilege of Hakem, which had been so patiently endured by the Latin 
Christians! A slighter provocation inflamed the more irascible temper 
of their descendants: a new spirit had arisen of religious chivalry and 
papal dominion; a nerve was touched of exquisite feeling; and the sen- 
sation vibrated to the heart of Europe.

native of Amiens, in the province of Picardy x in France. His resent* 
ment and sympathy were excited by his own injuries and the oppres- 
sion of the Christian name; he mingled his tears with those of the 
patriarch, and earnestly inquired if no hopes of relief could be enter- 
tained from the Greek emperors of the East. The patriarch exposed 
the vices and weakness of the successors of Constantine. "I will 
rouse," exclaimed the hermit, " the martial nations of Europe in your 
cause;" and Europe was obedient to the call of the hermit. The 
astonished patriarch dismissed him with epistles of credit and com- 
plaint; and no sooner did he land at Bari than Peter hastened to kiss 
the feet of the Roman pontiff. His stature was small, his appearance 
contemptible; but his eye was keen and lively, and he possessed that 
vehemence of speech which seldom fails to impart the persuasion of 
the soul. 2 He was born of a gentleman's family (for we must now 
adopt a modern idiom) , and his military service was under the neigh- 
bouring counts of Boulogne, the heroes of the first crusade. But he 
soon relinquished the sword and the world; and if it be true that his 
wife, however noble, was aged and ugly, he might withdraw with the 
less reluctance from her bed to a convent, and. at length to a hermitage. 
In this austere solitude his body was emaciated, his fancy was in- 
flamed; whatever he wished, he believed; whatever he believed, he 
saw in dreams and revelations. From Jerusalem the pilgrim returned 
an accomplished fanatic; but as he excelled in the popular madness of 
the times, Pope Urban the Second received him as a prophet, ap- 
plauded his glorious design, promised to support it in a general coun- 
cil, and encouraged him to proclaim the deliverance of the Holy Land. 
Invigorated by the approbation of the pontiff, his zealous missionary 
traversed, with speed and success, the provinces of Italy and France. 
His diet was abstemious, his prayers long and fervent, and the alms 
which he received with one hand, he distributed with the other: his 
head was bare, his feet naked, his meagre body was wrapped in a 
coarse garment; he bore and displayed a weighty crucifix; and the ass 
on which he rode was sanctified, in the public eye, by the service of 
the man of God. He preached to innumerable crowds in the churches, 
the streets, and the highways: the hermit entered with equal confi- 
dence the palace and the cottage; and the people, for all was people, 
was impetuously moved by his call to repentance and arms. When he 
painted the sufferings of the natives and pilgrims of Palestine, every

heart was melted to compassion; every breast glowed with indignation 
when he challenged the warriors of the age to defend their brethren, 
and rescue their Saviour: his ignorance of art and language was com- 
pensated by sighs, and tears, and ejaculations; and Peter supplied the 
deficiency of reason by loud and frequent appeals to Christ and his 
mother, to the saints and angels of paradise, with whom he had per- 
sonally conversed. The most perfect orator of Athens might have 
envied the success of his eloquence: the rustic enthusiast inspired the 
passions which he felt, and Christendom expected with impatience the 
counsels and decrees of the supreme pontiff. 

The magnanimous spirit of Gregory the Seventh had already em- 
braced the design of arming Europe against Asia; the ardour of his 
zeal and ambition still breathes in his epistles; from either side of the 
Alps fifty thousand Catholics had enlisted under the banner of St. 
Peter; 8 and his successor reveals his intention of marching at their 
head against the impious sectaries of Mohammed. But the glory or 
reproach of executing, though not in person, this holy enterprise, was 
reserved for Urban the Second, 4 the most faithful of Ms disciples. He 
undertook the conquest of the East, whilst the larger portion of Rome 
was possessed and fortified by his rival Guibert of Ravenna, who con* 
tended with Urban for the name and honours of the pontificate. He 
attempted to unite the powers of the West, at a time when the princes 
were separated from the church, and the people from their princes, 
by the excommunication which himself and his predecessors had thun- 
dered against the emperor and the king of France. Philip the First 
of France supported with patience the- censure? which he had provoked 
by his scandalous life and adulterous marriage. Henry the Fourth oi 
Germany asserted the right of investitures, the prerogative of con- 
firming his bishops by the delivery of the ring and crosier. But the 
emperor's party was crushed in Italy by the arms of the Normans and 
the countess Mathilda; and the long quarrel had been recently en- 
venomed by the revolt of his son Conrad and the shame of his wife,* 
who, in the synods of Constance and Placentia, confessed the manifold 
prostitutions to which she had been exposed by a husband regardless 
of her honour and his own. So popular was the cause of Urban, so

weighty was his influence, that the council which he summoned at 
Placentia T was composed of two hundred bishops of Italy, France, 
Burgundy, Swabia, and Bavaria. Four thousand of the clergy and 
thirty thousand of the laity attended this important meeting; and, as 
the most spacious cathedral would have been inadequate to the multi- 
tude, the session of seven days was held in a plain adjacent to the 
city. The ambassadors of the Greek emperor, Alexius Comnenus, 
were introduced to plead the distress of their sovereign, and the danger 
of Constantinople, which was divided only by a narrow sea from the 
victorious Turks, the common enemies of the Christian name. In their 
suppliant address they flattered the pride of the Latin princes; and, 
appealing at once to their policy and religion, exhorted them to repel 
the barbarians on the confines of Asia, rather than to expect them in 
the heart of Europe. At the sad tale of the misery and perils of their 
Eastern brethren the assembly burst into tears: the most eager cham- 
pions declared their readiness to march; and the Greek ambassadors 
were dismissed with the assurance of a speedy and powerful succour. 
The relief of Constantinople was included in the larger and most dis- 
tant project of the deliverance of Jerusalem; but the prudent Urban 
adjourned the final decision to a second synod, which he proposed to 
celebrate in some city of France in the autumn of 'the same year. The 
short delay would propagate the flame of enthusiasm; and his firmest 
hope was in a nation of soldiers 8 still proud of the pre-eminence of 
their name, and ambitious to emulate their hero Charlemagne, 9 who,

Holy Land. A latent motive of affection or vanity might influence 
the choice of Urban: he was himself a native of France, a monk of 
Clugny, and the first of his countrymen who ascended the throne of 
St. Peter. The pope had illustrated his family and province; nor is 
there perhaps a more exquisite gratification than to revisit, in a con- 
spicuous dignity, the humble and laborious scenes of our youth. 

It may occasion some surprise that the Roman pontiff should erect, 
in the heart of France, the tribunal from whence he hurled his anathe- 
mas against the king; but our surprise will vanish so soon as we form 
a just estimate of a king of France of the eleventh century. 11 Philip 
the First was the great-grandson of Hugh Capet, the founder of the 
present race, who, in the decline of Charlemagne's posterity, added the 
regal title to his patrimonial estates of Paris and Orleans. In this 
narrow compass he was possessed of wealth and jurisdiction; but in the 
rest of France Hugh and his first descendants were no more than the 
feudal lords of about sixty dukes and counts, of independent and he- 
reditary power, 12 who disdained the control of laws and legal assem- 
blies, and whose disregard of their sovereign was revenged by the dis- 
obedience of their inferior vassals. At Clermont, in the territories of 
the count of Auvergne, 18 the pope might brave with impunity the re- 
sentment of Philip; and the council which he convened in that city 
was not less numerous or respectable than the synod of Placentia. 1 * 
Besides his court and council of Roman cardinals, he was supported 
by thirteen archbishops and two hundred and twenty-five bishops; 
the number of mitred prelates was computed at four hundred; and the 
fathers of the church were blessed by the saints and enlightened by 
the doctors of the age. From the adjacent kingdoms a martial train 
of lords and knights of power and renown attended the council, 15 in 
high expectation of its resolves; and such was the ardour of zeal and 
curiosity, that the city was filled, and many thousands, in the month 
of November, erected their tents or huts in the open field. A session: 
of eight days produced some useful or edifying canons for the reforma- 
tion of manners; a severe censure was pronounced against the licence

of private war; the Truce of God 16 was confirmed, a suspension of 
hostilities during four days of the week; women and priests were 
placed under the safeguard of the church; and a protection of three 
years was extended to husbandmen and merchants, the defenceless vic- 
tims of military rapine. But a law, however venerable be the sanction, 
cannot suddenly transform the temper of the times; and the benevo- 
lent efforts of Urban deserve the less praise, since he laboured to ap- 
pease some domestic quarrels that he might spread the flames of war 
from the Atlantic to the Euphrates. From the synod of Placentia the 
rumour of his great design had gone forth among the nations: the 
clergy on their return had preached in every diocese the merit and 
glory of the deliverance of the Holy Land; and when the pope ascended 
a lofty scaffold in the market-place of Clermont, his eloquence was ad- 
dressed to a well-prepared and impatient audience. His topics were 
obvious, his exhortation was vehement, his success inevitable. The 
orator was interrupted by the shout of thousands, who with one voice, 
and in their rustic idiom, exclaimed aloud, " God wills it, God wills 
it!" " " It is indeed the will of God," replied the pope; " and let this 
memorable word, the inspiration surely of the Holy Spirit, be for ever 
adopted as your cry of battle, to animate the devotion and courage of 
the champions of Christ His cross is the symbol of your salvation; 
wear it, a red, a bloody cross, as an external mark, on your breasts or 
shoulders,, as a pledge of your sacred and irrevocable engagement." 
The proposal was joyfully accepted; great numbers, both of the clergy 
and laity, impressed on their garments the sign of the cross, 18 and so- 
licited the pope to march at their head. This dangerous honour was 
declined by the more prudent successor of Gregory, who alleged the 
schism of the church, and the duties of his pastoral office, recommend- 
ing to the faithful, who were disqualified by sex or profession, by age 
or infirmity, to aid with their prayers and alms the personal service 
of their robust brethren. The name and powers of his legate he de- 
volved on Adhemar, bishop of Puy, the first who had received the

cross at his hands. The foremost of the temporal chiefs was Ray- 
mond, count of Toulouse, whose ambassadors in the council excused 
the absence, and pledged the honour, of their master. After the con- 
fession and absolution of their sins, the champions of the cross were 
dismissed with a superfluous admonition to invite their countrymen 
and friends; and their departure for the Holy Land was fixed to the 
festival of the Assumption, the fifteenth of August, of the ensuing 
year. 19 

So familiar, and as it were so natural to man, is the practice of 
violence, that our indulgence allows the slightest provocation, the 
most disputable right, as a sufficient ground of national hostility. But 
the name and nature of a holy war demands a more rigorous scrutiny; 
nor can we hastily believe that the servants of the Prince of Peace 
would unsheathe the sword of destruction unless the motive were pure, 
the quarrel legitimate, and the necessity inevitable. The policy of an 
action may be determined from the tardy lessons of experience; but 
before we act, our conscience should be satisfied of the justice and pro- 
priety of our enterprise. In the age of the crusades, the Christians, 
both of the East and West, were persuaded of their lawfulness and 
merit; their arguments are clouded by the perpetual abuse of Scripture 
and rhetoric; but they seem to insist on the right of natural and re- 
ligious defence, their peculiar title to the Holy Land, and the impiety 
of their Pagan and Mohammedan foes. 20 I. The right of a just de- 
fence may fairly include our civil and spiritual allies: it depends on thrf 
existence of danger; and that danger must be estimated by the twofold 
consideration of the malice and the power of our enemies. A pernicious 
tenet has been imputed to the Mohammedans, the duty of extirpating 

19 Bongarsius, who has published the original writers of the crusades, 
adopts, with much complacency, the fanatic title of Guibertus, Gesta DEI per 
Francos; though some critics propose to read Gesta Diaboli per Francos 
(Hanoviae, 1611, two vols. in folio). I shall briefly enumerate, as they stand 
in this collection, the authors whom I have used for the first crusade. I. 
Gesta Francorum. II. Robertas Monachus. III. Baldricus, IV. Raimundus 
de Agiles. V. Albertus Aquensis. VI. Fulcherius Carnotensis. VII. Guiber- 
tus. VIII. Willielmus Tyriensis. Muratori has given us, IX. Radulphus 
Cadomensis de Gestis Tancredi (Script. Rer. ItaL torn. v. p. 285-333), and, 
X. Bernardus Thesaurarius de Acquisitione Terrse Sanctse (torn. vii. p. 
664-848). The last of these was unknown to a late French historian, who 
has given a large and critical list of the writers of the crusades (Esprit des 
Croisades, torn. i. p. 13-141), and most of whose judgments my own 
experience will allow me to ratify. It was late before I could obtain a 
sight of the French historians collected by Buchesne. I. Petri Tudebodi 
Sacerdotis Sivracensis Historia de Hierosolymitano Itinere (torn. iv. p. 
773-815) has been transfused into the first anonymous writer of Bongarsius. 
II. The Metrical History of the First Crusade, in seven books (p. 890-912), 
is of small value or account. 

29 If the reader will turn to the first scene of the First Part of Henry the 
Fourth, he will see in the text of Shakspeare the natural feelings of enthu- 
siasm; and in the notes of Dr. Johnson the workings of a bigoted, though 
vigorous, mind, greedy of every pretence to hate and persecute those who 
dissent from his creed. 



P4 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

all other religions by the sword. This charge of ignorance and bigotry 
is refuted by the Koran, by the history of the Musulman conquerors, 
and by their public and legal toleration of the Christian worship. But 
it cannot be denied that the Oriental churches are depressed under 
their iron yoke; that, in peace and war, they assert a divine and inde- 
feasible claim of universal empire; and that, in their orthodox creed, 
the unbelieving nations are continually threatened with the loss of 
religion or liberty. In the eleventh century the victorious arms of the 
Turks presented a real and urgent apprehension of these losses. They 
had subdued in less than thirty years the kingdoms of Asia, as far as 
Jerusalem and the Hellespont; and the Greek empire tottered on the 
verge of destruction. Besides an honest sympathy for their brethren, 
the Latins had a right and interest in the support of Constantinople, 
the most important barrier of the West; and the privilege of defence 
must reach to prevent, as well as to repel, an impending assault. But 
this salutary purpose might have been accomplished by a moderate 
succour; and our calmer reason must disclaim the innumerable hosts 
and remote operations which overwhelmed Asia and depopulated Eu- 
rope. II. Palestine could add nothing to the strength or safety of the 
Latins; and fanaticism alone could pretend to justify the conquest of 
that distant and narrow province. The Christians affirmed that their 
inalienable title to the promised land had been sealed by the blood of 
their divine Saviour; it was their right and duty to rescue their in- 
heritance from the unjust possessors, who profaned his sepulchre, and 
oppressed the pilgrimage of his disciples. Vainly would it be alleged 
that the pre-eminence of Jerusalem and the sanctity of Palestine have 
been abolished with the Mosaic law; that the God of the Christians 
is not a local deity, and that the recovery of Bethlehem or Calvary, 
his cradle or his tomb, will not atone for the violation of the moral 
precepts of the Gospel. Such arguments glance aside from the leaden 
shield of superstition; and the religious mind will not easily relinquish 
its hold on the sacred ground of mystery and miracle. III. But the 
holy wars which have been waged in every climate of the globe, from 
Egypt to Livonia, and from Peru to Hindostan, require the support of 
some more general and flexible tenet. It has been often supposed, and 
sometimes affirmed, that a difference of religion is a worthy cause of 
hostility; that obstinate unbelievers may be slain or subdued by the 
champions of the cross; and that grace is the sole fountain of domin- 
ion as well as of mercy. Above four hundred years before the first 
crusade, the eastern and western provinces of the Roman empire had 
been acquired about the same time, and in the same manner, by the 
barbarians of Germany and Arabia. Time and treaties had legitimated 
the conquests of the Christian Franks; but in the eyes of their subjects 
and neighbours the Mohammedan princes were still tyrants and usurp- 
ers, who, by the arms of war or rebellion, might be lawfully driven from 
their unlawful possession. 21 

a The sixth Discourse of Fleury on Ecclesiastical History (p. 223-261) 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 4*5 

As the manners of the Christians were relaxed, their discipline of 
penance 22 was enforced; and with the multiplication of sins the reme- 
dies were multiplied. In the primitive church a voluntary and open 
confession prepared the work of atonement. In the middle ages the 
bishops and priests interrogated the criminal, compelled him to account 
for his thoughts, words, and actions, and prescribed the terms of his 
reconciliation with God. But as this discretionary power might alter- 
nately be abused by indulgence and tyranny, a rule of discipline was 
framed to inform and regulate the spiritual judges. This mode of 
legislation was invented by the Greeks; their penitentials 28 were trans- 
lated, or imitated, in the Latin church; and in the time of Charlemagne 
the clergy of every diocese were provided with a code, which they 
prudently concealed from the knowledge of the vulgar. In this dan- 
gerous estimate of crimes and punishments each case was supposed, 
each difference was remarked, by the experience or penetration of the 
monks; some sins are enumerated which innocence could not have sus- 
pected, and others which reason cannot believe; and the more ordi- 
nary offences of fornication and adultery, of perjury and sacrilege, of 
rapine and murder, were expiated by a penance which, according to 
the various circumstances, was prolonged from forty days to seven 
years. During this term of mortification the patient was healed, the 
criminal was absolved, by a salutary regimen of fasts and prayers: the 
disorder of his dress was expressive of grief and remorse; and he 
humbly abstained from all the business and pleasure of social life. 
But the. rigid execution of these laws would have depopulated the 
palace, the camp, and the city; the barbarians of the West believed and 
trembled; but nature often rebelled against principle; and the magis- 
trate laboured without effect to enforce the jurisdiction of the priest. 
A liberal accomplishment of penance was indeed impracticable: the 
guilt of adultery was multiplied by daily repetition; that of homicide 
might involve the massacre of a whole people; each act was separately 
numbered; and, in those times of anarchy and vice, a modest sinner 
might easily incur a debt of three hundred years. His insolvency was 
relieved by a commutation or indulgence", a year of penance was appre- 
ciated at twenty-six solid* 2 * of silver, about four pounds sterling, for 

contains an accurate and rational view of the causes and effects of the 
crusades. 

88 The penance, indulgences, etc., of the middle ages are amply discussed 
by Muratori (Antiquitat Italiae medii ^Evi, torn. v. dissert. Ixviii. p. 709-768) 
and by M. Chais (Lettres sur les Jubiles et les Indulgences, torn. ii. lettres 
21 and 22, p. 478-556), with this difference, that the abuses of superstition 
are mildly, perhaps faintly, exposed by the learned Italian, and peevishly 
magnified by the Dutch minister. 

"Schmidt (Histoire des Allemands, torn. ii. p. 211-220, 452-462) gives 
an abstract of the Penitential of Rhegino in the ninth, and of Burchard in 
the tenth, century. In one year five-and-thirty murders were perpetrated 
at Worms.

the rich; at three solidi ; or nine shillings, for the indigent: and these 
alms were soon appropriated to the use of the church, which derived 
from the redemption of sins an inexhaustible source' of opulence and 
dominion. A debt of three hundred years, or twelve hundred pounds, 
was enough to impoverish a plentiful fortune; the scarcity of gold and 
silver was supplied by the alienation of land; and the princely dona- 
tions of Pepin and Charlemagne are expressly given for the remedy 
of their soul. It is a maxim of the civil law, that whosoever cannot pay 
with his purse must pay with his body; and the practice of flagellation 
was adopted by the monks a cheap though painful equivalent. By a 
fantastic arithmetic, a year of penance was taxed at three thousand 
lashes; 25 and such was the skill arid patience of a famous hermit, St. 
Dominic of the Iron Cuirass, 26 that in six days he could discharge an 
entire century by a whipping of three hundred thousand stripes* His 
example was followed by many penitents of both Sexes; and as a vica- 
rious sacrifice was accepted, a sturdy disciplinarian might expiate on 
his own back the sins of his benefactors. 27 These compensations of the 
purse and the person introduced, in the eleventh century, a more hon- 
ourable mode of satisfaction. The merit of military service against the 
Saracens of Africa and Spain had been, allowed by the predecessors of 
Urban the Second. In the council of Clermont, that pope proclaimed 
a plenary indulgence to those who should enlist under the baniier of 
the cross; the absolution of all their sins, and a full receipt for all that 
might be due of canonical penance. 28 The cold philosophy of modem 
times is incapable of feeling the impression that was made on a sinful 
and fanatic world. At the voice of their pastor, the robber, the in- 
cendiary, the homicide, arose by thousands to redeem their souls by 
repeating on the infidels the same' deeds which they had exercised 
against their Christian brethren; and the terms of atonement were 
eagerly embraced by offenders of every rank and denomination. None 
were pure; none were exempt from the guilt and penalty of sin; and 

weight of silver, about the pound sterling. Our money is diminished to a 
third, and the French to a fiftieth, . of this primitive standard.

those who were the least amenable to the justice of God and the church 
were the best entitled to the temporal and eternal recompense of their 
pious courage. If they fell, the spirit of the Latin clergy did not hesi- 
tate to adorn their tomb with the crown of martyrdom; 29 and should 
they survive, they could expect without impatience the delay and in- 
crease of their heavenly reward. They offered their blood to the Son 
of God, who had laid down his life for their salvation: they took up the 
cross, and entered with confidence into the way of the Lord. His provi- 
dence would watch over their safety; perhaps his visible and miraculous 
power would smooth the difficulties of their holy enterprise. The cloud 
and pillar of Jehovah had marched before the Israelites into the prom- 
ised land. Might not the Christians more reasonably hope that the 
rivers would open for their passage; that the walls of the strongest 
cities would fall at the sound of their trumpets; and that the sun would 
be arrested in his mid-career to allow them time for the destruction 
of the infidels? 

Of the chiefs and soldiers who marched to the holy sepulchre, I will 
dare to affirm that all were prompted by the spirit of enthusiasm, the 
belief of merit, the hope of reward, and the assurance of divine aii 
But I am equally persuaded that in many it was not the sole, that in 
some it was not the leading, principle of action. The use and abuse 
of religion are feeble to stem, they are strong and irresistible to impel, 
the stream of national manners. Against the private wars of the bar- 
barians, their bloody tournaments, licentious loves, and judicial duels, 
the popes and synods might ineffectually thunder. It is a more easy 
task to provoke the metaphysical disputes of the Greeks, to drive into 
the cloister the victims of anarchy or despotism, to sanctify the patience 
of slaves and cowards, or to assume the merit of the humanity and 
benevolence of modern Christians. War and exercise were the reigning 
passions of the Franks or Latins; they were enjoined, as a penance, 
to gratify those passions, to visit distant lands, and to draw their 
swords against the nations of the East. Their victory, or even their 
attempt, would immortalise the names of the intrepid heroes of the 
cross; and the purest piety could not be insensible to the most splendid 
prospect of military glory. In the petty quarrels of Europe they died 
the blood of their friends and countrymen for the acquisition, perhaps, 
of a castle or a village. They could march with alacrity against the 
distant and hostile nations who were devoted to their arms; their 
fancy already grasped the golden sceptres of Asia; and the conquest of 
Apulia and Sicily by the Normans might exalt to royalty the hopes of 
the most private adventurer. Christendom, in her rudest state, must 
have yielded to the climate and cultivation of the Mohammedan coun- 
tries; and their natural and artificial wealth had been magnified by the 

"Such at least was the belief of the crusaders, and such is the uniform 
style of the historians (Esprit des Croisades, torn. iii. p. 477) ; but the 
prayers for the repose of their souls are inconsistent in orthodox theology 
with the merits of martyrdom. 



4*8 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

tales of pilgrims and the gifts of an imperfect commerce. The vulgar, 
both the great and small, were taught to believe every wonder, of lands 
flowing with milk and honey, of mines and treasures, of gold and dia- 
monds, of palaces of marble and jasper, and of odoriferous groves of 
cinnamon and frankincense. In this earthly paradise each warrior 
depended on his sword to carve a plenteous and honourable establish- 
ment, which he measured only by the extent of his wishes. 30 Their 
vassals and soldiers trusted their fortunes to God and their master: 
the spoils of a Turkish emir might enrich the meanest follower of the 
camp; and the flavour of the wines, the beauty of the Grecian women, 81 
were temptations more adapted to the nature, than to the profession, 
of the champions of the cross. The love of freedom was a powerful 
incitement to the multitudes who were oppressed by feudal or ecclesi- 
astical tyranny. Under this holy sign, the peasants and burghers, who 
were attached to the servitude of the glebe, might escape from a 
haughty lord, and transplant themselves and their families to a land of 
liberty. The monk might release himself from the discipline of his 
convent, the debtor might suspend the accumulation of usury and the 
pursuit of his creditors, and outlaws and malefactors of every cast 
might continue to brave the laws and dude the punishment of their 
crimes. 82 

These motives were potent and numerous: when we have singly com- 
puted their weight on the mind of each individual, we must add the 
infinite series, the multiplying powers of example and fashion. The 
first proselytes became the warmest and most effectual missionaries of 
the cross: among their friends and countrymen they preached the duty, 
the merit, and the recompense of their holy vow, and the most reluctant 
hearers were insensibly drawn within the whirlpool of persuasion and 
authority. The martial youths were fired by the reproach or suspi- 
cion of cowardice; the opportunity of visiting with an army the sepul- 
chre of Christ was embraced by the old and infirm, by women and 
children, who consulted rather their zeal than their strength; and those 
who in the evening had derided the folly of their companions were the 
most eager, the ensuing day, to tread in their footsteps. The ignorance 
which magnified the hopes, diminished the perils, of the enterprise. 
Since the Turkish conquest, the paths of pilgrimage were obliterated; 

80 The same hopes were displayed in the letters of the adventurers ad 
animandos qui in Francia resederant. Hugh de Reiteste could boast that 
his share amounted to one abbey and ten castles, of the yearly value of 
1500 marks, and that he should acquire a hundred castles by the con- 
quest of Aleppo (Guibert, p. 554, 555 [1. vii. c. 35] ). 

In his genuine or fictitious letter to the Count of Flanders, Alexius 
mingles with the danger of the church, and the relics of saints, the auri et 
argenti arnor, and pulcherrimarum fceminarum voluptas (p. 476 [1. i. c. 4] ) ; 
as if, says the indignant Guibert, the Greek women were handsomer than 
those of France.

the chiefs themselves had an imperfect notion of the length of the way 
and the state of their enemies; and such was the stupidity of the people, 
that, at the sight of the first city or castle beyond the limits of their 
knowledge, they were ready to ask whether that was not the Jerusalem, 
the term and object of their labours. Yet the more prudent of the cru- 
saders, who were not sure that they should be fed from heaven with a 
shower of quails or manna, provided themselves with those precious 
metals which, in every country, are the representatives of every com- 
modity. To defray, according to their rank, the expenses of the road, 
princes alienated their provinces, nobles their lands and castles, peas- 
ants their cattle and the instruments of husbandry. The value of prop- 
erty was depreciated by the eager competition of multitudes; while 
the price of arms and horses was raised to an exorbitant height by the 
wants and impatience of the buyers. 83 Those who remained at home, 
with sense and money, were enriched by the epidemical disease: the 
sovereigns acquired at a cheap rate the domains of their vassals, and 
the ecclesiastical purchasers completed the payment by the assurance 
of their prayers. The cross, which was commonly sewed on the gar- 
ment, in cloth or silk, was inscribed by some zealots on their skin: 
an hot iron, or indelible liquor, was applied to perpetuate the mark; 
and a crafty monk, who showed the miraculous impression on his breast, 
was repaid with the popular veneration and the richest benefices of 
Palestine. 84 

The fifteenth of August had been fixed in the council of Clermont 
for the departure of the pilgrims; but the day was anticipated by the 
thoughtless and needy crowd of plebeians; and I shall briefly despatch 
the calamities which they inflicted and suffered before I enter on the 
more serious and successful enterprise of the chiefs. Early in the 
spring, from the confines of France and Lorraine, above sixty thousand 
of the populace of both sexes flocked round the first missionary of the 
crusade, and pressed him, with clamorous importunity, to lead them to 
the holy sepulchre. The hermit, assuming the character, without the 
talents or authority, of a general, impelled or obeyed the forward 
impulse of his votaries along the banks of the Rhine and Danube. 
Their wants and numbers soon compelled them to separate, and his 
lieutenant, Walter the Penniless, a valiant though needy soldier, con- 
ducted a vanguard of pilgrims, whose condition may be determined 
from the proportion of eight horsemen to fifteen thousand foot. The 
example and footsteps of Peter were closely pursued by another fa- 
natic, the monk Godescal, whose sermons had swept away fifteen or 
twenty thousand peasants from the villages of Germany. Their rear 
was again pressed by a herd of two hundred thousand, the most stupid

and savage refuse of the people, who mingled with their devotion a 
brutal licence of rapine, prostitution, and drunkenness. Some counts 
and gentlemen, at the head of three thousand horse, attended the mo- 
tions of the multitude to partake in the spoil: but their genuine lead- 
ers (may we credit such folly?) were a goose and a goat, who were 
carried in the front, and to whom these worthy Christians ascribed an 
infusion of the divine spirit. 83 Of these, and of other bands of enthusi- 
asts, the first and most easy warfare was against the Jews, the mur- 
derers of the Son of God. In the trading cities of the Moselle and the 
Rhine their colonies were numerous and rich, and they enjoyed, under 
the protection of the emperor and the bishops, the free exercise of 
their religion. 80 At Verdun, Treves, Mentz, Spires, Worms, many thou- 
sands of that unhappy people were pillaged and massacred, 37 nor had 
they felt a more bloody stroke since the persecution of Hadrian. A 
remnant was saved by the firmness of their bishops, who accepted a 
feigned and transient conversion; but the more obstinate Jews opposed 
their fanaticism to the fanaticism of the Christians, barricadoed their 
houses, and, precipitating themselves, their families, and their wealth 
into the rivers or the flames, disappointed the malice, or at least the 
avarice, of their implacable foes. 28

peasants founded an empire, they might have introduced, as in Egypt, the 
worship of animals, which their philosophic descendants would have glossed 
over with some specious and subtle allegory. 

"Benjamin of Tudela describes the state of his Jewish brethren from 
Cologne along the Rhine: they were rich, generous, learned, hospitable,

from these massacres.

decurions of Cologne, shows that they were then ,very numerous in that 
city, a fact which is confirmed by the large number of tombstones engraved 
with Hebrew characters. O. S.] 

47 These ma?3sua-es and depredations on the Jews, which were renewed 
at each crusade, are coolly related. It is true that St. Bernard (Epist 363, 
torn. L p. 329 [p. 328, ed. Bened.]) admonishes the Oriental Franks, non 
stint persequendi Judsei, non sunt trucidandi. The contrary doctrine had 
been preached by .a rival monk.

THE ROMAN EMPIRE . 43* 

archy the crusaders were compelled to traverse an interval of six hun- 
dred miles, the wild and desolate countries of Hungary 39 and Bul- 
garia. The soil is fruitful, and intersected with rivers; but it was then 
covered with morasses and forests, which spread to a boundless extent 
whenever man has ceased to exercise his dominion over the earth, 
Both nations had imbibed the rudiments of Christianity: the Hungari- 
ans were ruled by their native princes, the Bulgarians by a lieutenant 
of the Greek emperor; but, on the slightest provocation, their ferocious 
nature was rekindled, and ample provocation was afforded by the dis- 
orders of the first pilgrims. Agriculture must have been unskilful and 
languid among a people whose cities were built of reeds and timber, 
which were deserted in the summer season for the tents of hunters and 
shepherds. A scanty supply of provisions was rudely demanded, forci- 
bly seized, and greedily consumed, and on the first quarrel the crusad- 
ers gave a loose to indignation and revenge. But their ignorance of 
the country, of war, and of discipline exposed them to every snare. The 
Greek prsefect of Bulgaria commanded a regular force; at the trumpet 
of the Hungarian king,. the eighth or the tenth of his martial subjects 
bent their bows and mounted on horseback; their policy was insidi- 
ous, and their retaliation on these pious robbers was unrelenting and 
bloody. 40 About a third of the naked fugitives, and the hermit Peter 
was of the number, escaped to the Thracian mountains; and the em- 
peror, who respected the pilgrimage and succour of the Latins, con- 
ducted them by secure and easy journeys to Constantinople, and ad- 
vised them to await the arrival of their brethren. For a while they 
remembered their faults and losses, but no sooner were they revived 
by the hospitable entertainment, than their venom was again inflamed; 
they stung their benefactor, and neither gardens, nor palaces, not 
churches, were safe from their depredations. For his own safety,, 
Alexius allured them to pass over to the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus; 
but their blind impetuosity soon urged them to desert the station which 
he had assigned, and to rush headlong against the Turks, who occupied 
the road of Jerusalem. The hermit, conscious of his shame, had with-

40 The old Hungarians, without excepting Turotzius, are ill-informed of 
the first crusade, which they involve in a single passage. Katona, like 
ourselves, can only quote the writers of France; but he compares with 
local science the ancient and modern geography. Ante p or tarn Cyperon is 
Sopron or Poson; Mallevilla, Zemlm; Fluvius Maroe, Savus; Lin tar, Leith; 
Mescbrtich, or Merseburg, Ouar, or Moson ; Tollenburg, Pragg (de Regibus 
Hungariae, torn. iii. p. IQ-53)- 

[The narrative of the first march is very incorrect, -as f Milman says. 
The first party were under the command of Walter de Pexejo and Walter 
the Penniless. They passed safe through Hungary, the kingdom of Cal- 
many, but were attacked in Bulgaria. Peter the Hermit followed with 
20,000 men, passed through Hungary, -but seeing the clothing of sixteen 
crusaders on the walls of Semlin, he attacked the city. He then marched 
to Nissa, where at first he was hospitably received; but an accidental 
quarrel taking place, he suffered a great defeat. (X S.]

drawn from the camp to Constantinople; and his lieutenant, Walter 
the Penniless, who was worthy of a better command, attempted with- 
out success to introduce some order and prudence among the herd of 
savages. They separated in quest of prey, and themselves fell an easy 
prey to the arts of the sultan. By a rumour that their foremost com- 
panions were rioting in the spoils of his capital, Soliman tempted the 
main body to descend into the plain of Nice: they were overwhelmed 
by the Turkish arrows, and a pyramid of bones 41 informed their com- 
panions of the place of their defeat. Of the first crusaders, three hun- 
dred thousand had already perished before a single city was rescued 
from the infidels, before their graver and more noble brethren had com- 
pleted the preparations of their enterprise.* 2 

None of the great sovereigns of Europe embarked their persons in 
the first crusade. The emperor Henry the Fourth was not disposed to 
obey the summons of the pope; Philip the First of France was occu- 
pied by his pleasures; William Rufus of England by a recent conquest;

mountain i^X6y *ai p&amp;0os ical ir\&amp;ros &amp;^\oy^ra.rov. In the siege of Nice such 
were used by the Franks themselves as the materials of a wall. 

[This is a mistake of Gibbon's to say that Soliman tempted the main 
body to descend into the plain of Nice, for Soliman had been killed in 1086 
in a battle against Toutouch, brother of Malek Shah, between Aleppo and 
Antioch. It was Soliman's son David, surnamed Kilidge-Arslan, the " Sword 
of the Lion," who succeeded in 1092 and reigned till noo. His kingdom 
extended from the Orontes to the Euphrates, and as far as the Bosphorus.

the kings of Spain were engaged in a domestic war Against the Moors; 
and the northern monarchs of Scotland, Denmark, 48 Sweden, and Po- 
land were yet strangers to the passions and interests of the South. The 
religious ardour was more strongly felt by the princes of the second 
order, who held an important place in the feudal system. Their situ- 
ation will naturally cast under four distinct heads the review of their 
names and characters; but I may escape some needless repetition, by 
observing at once that courage and the exercise of arms are the common 
attribute of these Christian adventurers. I. The first rank both in war 
and council is justly due to Godfrey of Bouillon; and happy would it 
have been for the crusaders, if they had trusted themselves to the sole 
conduct of that accomplished hero, a worthy representative of Charle- 
magne, from whom he was descended in the female line. His father 
was of the noble race of the counts of Boulogne: Brabant, the lower 
province of Lorraine, 44 was the inheritance of his mother; and by the

still lives in the poem of Tasso (torn. iv. p. 111-115).

emperor's bounty e was himself invested with that ducal title, which 
has been improperly transferred to his lordship of Bouillon in the Ar- 
dennes/ 5 In the service of Henry the Fourth he bore the great stand- 
ard of the empire, and pierced with his lance the breast of Rodolph, 
the rebel king: Godfrey was the first who ascended the walls of Rome; 
and his sickness, his vow, perhaps his remorse for bearing arms against 
the pope, confirmed an early resolution of visiting the holy sepulchre, 
not as a pilgrim, but a deliverer. His valour was matured by prudence 
and moderation; his piety, though blind, was sincere; and, in the 
tumult of a camp, he practised the real and fictitious virtues of a con- 
vent. Superior to the private factions of the chiefs, he reserved his 
enmity for the enemies of Christ; and though he gained a kingdom by 
the attempt, his pure and disinterested zeal was acknowledged ,by his 
rivals. Godfrey of Bouillon * 6 was accompanied by his two brothers, 
by Eustace the elder, who had succeeded to the county of Boulogne, 
and by the younger, Baldwin, a character of more ambiguous virtue. 
The duke of Lorraine was alike celebrated on either side of the Rhine: 
from his birth and education, he was equally conversant with the French 
and Teutonic languages: the barons of France, Germany, and Lor- 
raine assembled their vassals; and the confederate force that marched 
under his banner was composed of fourscore thousand foot and about 
ten thousand horse. II. In the parliament that was held at Paris, in 
the king's presence, about two months after the council of Clermont, 
Hugh, count of Vermandois, was the most conspicuous of the princes 
who assumed the cross. But the appellation of the Great was applied, 
not so much to his merit or possessions (though neither were contempt- 
ible), as to .the royal birth of the brother of the king of France.* 7 
Robert, duke of Normandy, was the eldest son of William the Con- 
queror; but on his father's death he was deprived of the kingdom of 
England, by his own indolence and the activity of his brother Rufus. 
The worth of Robert was degraded by an excessive levity and easiness 
of temper: his cheerfulness seduced him to the indulgence of pleasure; 
his profuse liberality impoverished the prince and people; his indis- 
criminate clemency multiplied the number of offenders; and the ami- 
able qualities of a private man became the essential defects of a sov- 
ereign. For the trifling sum of ten thousand marks he mortgaged Nor- 

by Duke Gozelo. On his death, however, they were again divided between 
his two sons. O. S.] 

48 See, in the Description of France, by the Abbe de Longuerue, the 
articles of Boulogne, part i. p. 54; Brabant, part ii. p. 47, 48; Bouillon, 
p. 134. On his departure Godfrey sold or pawned Bouillon to the church 
for 1300 marks.

his previous design in Guibert (p. 485 [L ii. c. 12] ) ; his sickness and vow in 
Bernard. Thesaur. (c. 78). 

* T Anna Comnena supposes that Hugh was proud of his nobility, riches, 
and power (L x. p. 288) : the two last articles appear more equivocal; but

Constantinople, attests the ancient dignity of the Capetian family of France. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 435 

mandy during his absence to the English usurper; 48 but his engagement 
and behaviour in the holy war announced in Robert a reformation of 
manners, and restored him in some degree to the public esteem. An- 
other Robert was count of Flanders, a royal province, which, in this 
century, gave three queens to the thrones of France, England, and Den- 
mark: he was surnamed the Sword and Lance of the Christians; but 
in the exploits of a soldier he sometimes forgot the duties of a general. 
Stephen, count of Chartres, of Blois, and of Troyes, was one of the 
richest princes of the age; and the number of his castles has been com- 
pared to the three hundred and sixty-five days of the year. His mind 
was improved by literature; and, in the council of the chiefs, the elo- 
quent Stephen ** was chosen to discharge the office of their president. 
These four were the principal leaders of the French, the Normans, and 
the pilgrims of the British isles: but the list of the barons who were 
possessed of three or four towns would exceed, says a contemporary, 
the catalogue of the Trojan war. 50 III. In the south of France the 
command was assumed by Adhemar, bishop of Puy, the pope's legate, 
and by Raymond count of St. Giles and Toulouse, who added the 
prouder titles of duke of Narbonne and marquis of Provence. The 
former was a respectable prelate, alike qualified for this world and the 
next. The latter was a veteran warrior, who had fought against the 
Saracens of Spain, and who consecrated his declining age, not only to 
the deliverance, but to the perpetual service, of the holy sepulchre- 
His experience and riches gave him a strong ascendant in the Christian 
camp, whose distress he was often able, and sometimes willing, to re- 
lieve. But it was easier for him to extort the praise of the Infidels than 
to preserve the love of his subjects and associates. His eminent quali- 
ties were clouded by a temper, haughty, envious, and obstinate; and^ 
though he resigned an ample patrimony for the cause of God, his piety, 
in the public opinion, was not exempt from avarice and ambition. 51 
A mercantile, rather than a martial, spirit prevailed among his pro- 
vincids?* a common name, which included the natives of Auvergne

and Languedpc, 88 the vassals of the kingdom of Burgundy or Aries. 
From the adjacent frontier of Spain he drew a band of hardy adven- 
turers; as he marched through Lombardy, a crowd of Italians flocked 
to his standard, and his united force consisted of one hundred thou- 
sand horse and foot. If Raymond was the first to enlist and the last 
to depart, the delay may be excused by the greatness of his preparation 
and the promise of an everlasting farewell. IV. The name of Bohe- 
mond, the son of Robert Guiscard, was already famous by his double 
victory over the Greek emperor: but his father's will had reduced him 
to the principality of Tarentum, and the remembrance of his Eastern 
trophies, till he was awakened by the rumour and passage of the 
French pilgrims. It is in the person of this Norman chief that we may 
seek for the coolest policy and ambition, with a small allay of religious 
fanaticism. His conduct may justify a belief that he had secretly 
directed the design of the pope, which he affected to second with aston- 
ishment and zeal: at the siege of Amalphi his example and discourse 
inflamed the passions of a confederate army; he instantly tore his 
garment to supply crosses for the numerous candidates, and prepared 
to visit Constantinople and Asia at the head of ten thousand horse and 
twenty thousand foot. Several princes of the Norman race accompanied 
this veteran general; and his cousin Tancred 5 * was the partner, rather 
than the servant, of the war. In the accomplished character of Tan- 
cred we discover all the virtues of a perfect knight, 85 the true spirit of 
thivalry, which inspired the generous sentiments and social offices of 
man far better than the base philosophy, or the baser religion, of the 
times. 

Between the age of Charlemagne and that of the crusades, a revolu- 
tion had taken place among the Spaniards, the Normans, and the 
French, which was gradually extended to the rest of Europe. The 
service of the infantry was degraded to the plebeians; the cavalry 

89 The town of his birth, or first appanage, was consecrated to St. JEgidius 
whose name, as early as the first crusade, was corrupted by the French into 
St Gilles, or St Giles. It is situate in the Lower Languedoc, between 
Nismes and the Rhone, and still boasts a collegiate church of the foundation 
of Raymond (Melanges tires d'une Grande Bibliotheque, torn, xxxvii p 51) 

m The mother of Tancred was Emma, sister of the great Robert Guiscard " 
his father, the marquis Odo the Good. It is singular enough that the family 
and country of so illustrious a person should be unknown; but Muratori 
reasonably conjectures that he was an Italian, and perhaps of the race of 
the marquises of Montferrat in Piedmont (Script, torn. v. p. 281 282) 
m To gratify the childish vanity of the house of Este, Tasso has inserted

Rinaldo (x. 75 xvii. 66-94). He might borrow his name from a Rinaldo 
with the Aquila bianca Estense, who vanquished, as the standard-bearer 
of the Roman church, the emperor Frederic I. (Storia Imperiale di Rico- 
baldo, in Muraton Script. Ital. torn. ix. p. 360; Ariosto, Orlando Furioso 
m. 30). But, I, The _ distance of sixty years between the youth of the two 
Kmaldos destroys their identity. 2. The Storia Imperiale is a forgery of the 
S- ^. B g? r f at the end of the fifteenth century (Muratori, p. 281-280). 
This Rinaldo, and his exploits, are not less chimerical than the hero of 
Tasso (Muraton, Anfechita Estense, torn. i. p. 350). 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 437 

formed^the strength of the armies; and the honourable name of miles, 
or soldier, was confined to the gentlemen 56 who served on horseback, 
and were invested with the character of knighthood. The dukes and 
counts, who had usurped the rights of sovereignty, divided the prov- 
inces among their faithful barons: the barons distributed among their 
vassals the fiefs or benefices of their jurisdiction; and these military 
tenants, the peers of each other and of their lord, composed the noble 
or equestrian order, which disdained to conceive the peasant or burgher 
as of the same species with themselves. The dignity of their birth 
was preserved by pure and equal alliances; their sons alone, who could 
produce four quarters or lines of ancestry, without spot or reproach, 
might legally pretend to tie honour of knighthood; but a valiant 
plebeian was sometimes enriched and ennobled by the sword, and be- 
came the father of a new race. A single knight could impart, accord- 
ing to his judgment, the character which he received; and the warlike 
sovereigns of Europe derived more glory from this personal distinc- 
tion than from the lustre of their diadem. This ceremony, of which 
some traces may be found in Tacitus and the woods of Germany, 57 
was in its origin simple and profane: the candidate, after some previous 
trial, was invested with the sword and spurs; and his cheek or shoulder 
was touched with a slight blow, as an emblem of the last affront which 
it was lawful for him to endure. But superstition mingled in every 
public and private action of life: in the holy wars it sanctified the 
profession of arms; and the order of chivalry was assimilated in its 
rights and privileges to the sacred orders of priesthood. The bath and 
white garment of the novice were an indecent copy of the regeneration 
of baptism: his sword, which he offered on the altar, was blessed by 
the ministers of religion: his solemn reception was preceded by fasts 
and vigils; and he was created a knight in the name of God, of St. 
George, and of St. Michael the archangel. He swore to accomplish the 
duties of his profession; and education, example, and the public opinion 
were the inviolable guardians of his oath. As the champion of God 
and the ladies (I blush to unite such discordant names), he devoted 
himself to speak with truth; to maintain the right; to protect the dis- 
tressed; to practise courtesy, a virtue less familiar to lie ancients; to 
pursue the infidels; to despise the allurements of ease and safety; and 
to vindicate in every perilous adventure the honour of his character. 
The abuse of the same spirit provoked the illiterate knight to disdain 
the arts of industry and peace; to esteem himself the sole judge and 
avenger of his own injuries; and proudly to neglect the laws of civil 
society and military discipline. Yet the benefits of this institution, to 

M 0f the words gentilis f gentilhomme, gentleman, two etymologies are 
produced: I. From the barbarians of the fifth century, the soldiers, and 
at length the conquerors, of the Roman empire, who were vain of their 
foreigji nobility; and, 2. From the sense of the civilians, who consider 
gentills as synonymous with ingenuus. Selden inclines to the first, but 
the latter is more pure, as well as probable.

438 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

refine the temper of barbarians, and to infuse some principles of faith, 
justice, and humanity, were strongly felt, and have been often ob- 
served. The asperity of national prejudice was softened; and the 
community of religion and arms spread a similar colour and generous 
emulation over the face of Christendom. Abroad in enterprise and 
pilgrimage, at home in martial exercise, the warriors of every country 
were perpetually associated; and impartial taste must prefer a Gothic 
tournament to the Olympic games of classic antiquity. 58 Instead of the 
naked spectacles which corrupted the manners of the Greeks, and ban- 
ished from the stadium the virgins and matrons, the pompous decora- 
tion of the lists was crowned with the presence of chaste and high-born 
beauty, from whose hands the conqueror received the prize of his dex- 
terity and courage. The skill and strength that were exerted in wres- 
tling and boxing bear a distant and doubtful relation to the merit of a 
soldier; but the tournaments, as they were invented in France, and 
eagerly adopted both in the East and West, presented a lively image 
of the business of the field. The single combats, the general skirmish, 
the defence of a pass, or castle, were rehearsed as in actual service; 
and the contest, both in real and mimic war, was decided by the supe- 
rior management of the horse and lance. The lance was the proper and 
peculiar weapon of the knight: his horse was of a large and heavy 
breed; but this charger, till he was roused by the approaching danger, 
was usually led by an attendant, and he quietly rode a pad or palfrey of 
a more easy pace. His helmet and sword, his greaves and buckler, it 
would be superfluous to describe; but I may remark, that, at the period 
of the crusades, the armour was less ponderous than in later times;, 
and that, instead of a massy cuirass, his breast was defended by a hau- 
berk or coat of mail. When their long lances were fixed in the rest, 
the warriors furiously spurred their horses against the foe; and the 
light cavalry of the Turks and Arabs could seldom stand against the 
direct and impetuous weight of their charge. Each knight was attended 
to the field by his faithful squire, a youth of equal birth and similar 
hopes; he was followed by his archers and men-at-arms, and four, or 
five, or six soldiers, were computed as the furniture of a complete lance. 
In the expeditions to the neighbouring kingdoms or the Holy Land, 
the duties of the feudal tenure no longer subsisted; the voluntary serv- 
ice of the knights and their followers was either prompted by zeal or 
attachment, or purchased with rewards and promises; and the numbers 
of each squadron were measured by the power, the wealth, and the 
fame of each independent chieftain. They were distinguished by his 
banner, his armorial coat, and his cry of war; and the most ancient 
families of Europe must seek in these achievements the origin and

proof of their nobility. In this rapid portrait of chivalry I have been 
urged to anticipate on the story of the crusades, at once an effect and 
a cause of this memorable institution. 50 

Such were the troops, and such the leaders, who assumed the cross 
for the deliverance of the holy sepulchre. As soon as they were relieved 
by the absence of the plebeian multitude, they encouraged each other, 
by interviews and messages, to accomplish their vow, and hasten their 
departure. Their wives and sisters were desirous of partaking the 
danger and merit of the pilgrimage: their portable treasures were con- 
veyed in bars of silver and gold; and the princes and barons were at- 
tended by their equipage of hounds and hawks to amuse their leisure 
and to supply their table. The difficulty of procuring subsistence for 
so many myriads of men and horses engaged them to separate their 
forces: their choice or situation determined the road; and it was agreed 
to meet in the neighbourhood of Constantinople, and from thence to 
begin their operations against the Turks. From the banks of the Meuse 
and the Moselle, Godfrey of Bouillon followed the direct way of Ger- 
many, Hungary, and Bulgaria; and, as long as he exercised the sole 
command, every step afforded some proof of his prudence and virtue. 
On the confines of Hungary he was stopped three weeks by a Christian 
people, to whom the name, or at least the abuse, of the cross was justly 
odious. The Hungarians still smarted with the wounds which they 
had received from the first pilgrims: in their turn they had abused the 
right of defence and retaliation; and they had reason to apprehend a 
severe revenge from a hero of the same nation, and who was engaged 
in the same cause. But, after weighing the motives and the events, the 
virtuous duke was content to pity the crimes and misfortunes of his 
worthless brethren; and his twelve deputies, the messengers of peace, 
requested in his name a free passage and an equal market. To remove 
their suspicions, Godfrey trusted himself, and afterwards his brother, 
to the faith of Carloman, king of Hungary, who treated them with a 
simple but hospitable entertainment: 00 the treaty was sanctified by their 
common Gospel; and a proclamation, under pain of death, restrained 
the animosity and licence of the Latin soldiers. From Austria to Bel- 
grade, they traversed the plains of Hungary, without enduring or offer- 
ing an injury; and the proximity of Carloman, who hovered on their 
flanks with his numerous cavalry, was a precaution not less useful for 
their safety than for his own. They reached the banks of the Save; 

"On the curious subjects of knighthood, knights-service, nobility, arms,

and no sooner had they passed the river than the king of Hungary 
restored the hostages, and saluted their departure with the fairest 
wishes for the success of their enterprise. With the same conduct and 
discipline Godfrey pervaded the woods of Bulgaria and the frontiers 
of Thrace; and might congratulate himself that he had almost reached 
the first term of his pilgrimage without drawing his sword against a 
Christian adversary. After an easy and pleasant journey through 
Lombardy, from Turin to Aquileia, Raymond and his provincials 
marched forty days through the savage country of Dalmatia 61 and 
Sclavonia. The weather was a perpetual fog; the land was mountainous 
and desolate; the natives were either fugitive or hostile: loose in their 
religion and government, they refused to furnish provisions or guides; 
murdered the stragglers; and exercised by night and day the vigilance 
of the count, who derived more security from the punishment of some 
captive robbers than from his interview and treaty with the prince of 
Scodra. 62 His march between Durazzo and Constantinople was har- 
assed, without being stopped, by the peasants and soldiers of the 
Greek emperor; and the same faint and ambiguous hostility was pre- 
pared for the remaining chiefs, who passed the Adriatic from the coast 
of Italy. Bohemond had arms and vessels, and foresight and disci- 
pline; and his name was not forgotten in the provinces of Epirus and 
Thessaly. Whatever obstacles he encountered were surmounted by 
his military conduct and the valour of Tancred; and if the Norman 
prince affected to spare the Greeks, he gorged his soldiers with the full 
plunder of an heretical castle. 63 The nobles of France pressed forwards 
with the vain and thoughtless ardour of which their nation has been 
sometimes accused. From the Alps to Apulia the march of Hugh 
the Great, of the two Roberts, and of Stephen of Chartres, through a 
wealthy country, and amidst the applauding Catholics, was a devout or 
triumphant progress: they kissed the feet of the Roman pontiff; and 
the golden standard of St. Peter was delivered to the brother of the

soldiers on a revenue of 78,787 rix-dollars (Marsigli, Stato Militare del

French monarch. 64 But in this visit of piety arid pleasure they neg- 
lected to secure the season and the means of their embarkation: the 
winter was insensibly lost: their troops were scattered and corrupted 
in the towns of Italy. They separately accomplished their passage, 
regardless of safety or dignity; and within nine months from the feast 
of the Assumption, the day appointed by Urban, all the Latin princes 
had reached Constantinople. But the count of Vermandois was pro- 
duced as a captive; his foremost vessels were scattered by a tempest; 
and his person, against the law of nations, was detained by the lieuten- 
ants of Alexius. Yet the arrival of Hugh had been announced by four- 
and-twenty knights in golden armour, who commanded the emperor to 
revere the general of the Latin Christians, the brother of the king of 
kings. 65 

In some Oriental tale I have read the fable of a shepherd who was 
ruined by the accomplishment of his own wishes: he had prayed for 
water; the Ganges was turned into bis ground, and his flock and cot- 
tage were swept away by the inundation. Such was the fortune, or 
at least the apprehension, of the Greek emperor Alexius Comnenus, 
whose name has already appeared in this history, and whose conduct is 
so differently represented by his daughter Anna, 66 and by the Latin 
writers. 67 In the council of Placentia his ambassadors had solicited a 
moderate succour, perhaps of ten thousand soldiers; but he was aston- 
ished by the approach of so many potent chiefs and fanatic nations. 
The emperor fluctuated between hope and fear, between timidity and 
courage; but in the crooked policy which he mistook for wisdom, I 
cannot believe, I cannot discern, that he maliciously conspired against 
the life or honour of the French heroes. The promiscuous multitudes 
of Peter the Hermit were savage beasts, alike destitute of humanity 
and reason: nor was it possible for Alexius to prevent or deplore their 
destruction. The troops of Godfrey and his peers were less contempt- 
ible, but not less suspicious, to the Greek emperor. Their motives

might oe pure and pious; but he was equally alarmed by his fcnowldege 
of the ambitious Bohemond, and his ignorance of lie Transalpine 
chiefs: the courage of the French was blind and headstrong; they 
might be tempted by the luxury and wealth of Greece, and elated by 
the view and opinion of their invincible strength; and Jerusalem might 
be forgotten in the prospect of Constantinople. After a long march 
and painful abstinence, the troops of Godfrey encamped in the plains 
of Thrace; they heard with indignation that their brother, the count 
of Vermandois, was imprisoned by the Greeks; and their reluctant 
duke was compelled to indulge them in some freedom of retaliation and 
rapine. They were appeased by the submission of Alexius: he prom- 
ised to supply their camp; and as they refused, hi the midst of whiter, 
to pass the Bosphorus, their quarters were assigned among the gardens 
and palaces on the shores of that narrow sea. But an incurable jeal- 
ousy still rankled in the minds of the two nations, who despised each 
other as slaves and barbarians. Ignorance is the ground of suspicion, 
and suspicion was inflamed into daily provocations: prejudice is blind, 
hunger is deaf; and Alexius is accused of a design to starve or assault 
the Latins in a dangerous post, on all sides encompassed with the 
waters.* 8 Godfrey sounded his trumpets, burst the net, overspread the 
plain, and insulted the suburbs: but the gates of Constantinople were 
strongly fortified; the ramparts were lined with archers; and after a 
doubtful conflict, both parties listened to the voice of peace and re- 
ligion. The gifts and promises of the emperor insensibly soothed the 
fierce spirit of the Western strangers; as a Christian warrior, he re- 
kindled their zeal for the prosecution of their holy enterprise, which he 
engaged to second with his troops and treasures. On the return of 
spring, Godfrey was persuaded to occupy a pleasant and plentiful camp 
in Asia; and no sooner had he passed the Bosphorus than the Greek 
vessels were suddenly recalled to the opposite shore. The same policy 
was repeated with the succeeding chiefs, who were swayed by the ex- 
ample, and weakened by the departure, of their foremost companions. 
By his skill and diligence Alexius prevented the union of any two of 
the confederate armies at the same moment under the walls of Con- 
stantinople; and before the feast of the Pentecost not a Latin pilgrim 
was left on the coast of Europe. 

The same arms which threatened Europe might deliver Asia, and 
repel the Turks from the neighbouring shores of the Bosphorus and 
Hellespont. The fair provinces from Nice to Antioch were the recent 
patrimony of the Roman emperor; and his ancient and perpetual daim 
still embraced the kingdoms of Syria and Egypt. In his enthusiasm, 
Alexius indulged, or affected, the ambitious hope of leading his new allies

THE ROMAN EMPiRE 443 

to subvert the thrones of the East; but the calmer dictates of reason 
and temper dissuaded him from exposing his royal person to the faith 
of unknown and lawless barbarians. His prudence, or his pride, was 
content with extorting from the French princes an oath of homage and 
fidelity, and a solemn promise that they would either restore, or hold, 
their Asiastic conquests, as the humble and loyal vassals of the Roman 
empire. Their independent spirit was fired at the mention of their 
foreign and voluntary servitude: they successively yielded to the dex- 
terous application of gifts and flattery; and the first proselytes became 
the most eloquent and effectual missionaries to multiply the compan- 
ions of their shame. The pride of Hugh of Vermandois was soothed 
by the honours of his captivity; and in the brother of the French king 
the example of submission was prevalent and weighty. In the mind of 
Godfrey of Bouillon every human consideration was subordinate to 
the glory of God and the success of the crusade. He had firmly resisted 
the temptations of Bohernond and Raymond, who urged the attack and 
conquest of Constantinople. Alexius esteemed his virtues, deservedly 
named him the champion of the empire, and dignified his homage with 
the filial name and the rights of adoption. 60 The hateful Bohemond 
was received as a true and ancient ally; and if the empercr reminded 
him of former hostilities, it was only to praise the valour that he had 
displayed, and the glory that he had acquired, in the fields of Durazzo 
and Larissa. The son of Guiscard was lodged, and entertained, and 
served with Imperial pomp: one day, as he passed through the gallery 
of the palace, a door was carelessly left open to expose a pile of gold 
and silver, of silk and gems, of curious and costly furniture, that was 
heaped in seeming disorder from the floor to the roof of the chamber. 
" What conquests," exclaimed the ambitious miser, " might not be 
achieved by the possession of such a treasure? " " It is your own," 
replied a Greek attendant, who watched the motions of his soul; and 
Bohemond, after some hesitation, condescended to accept this magnifi- 
cent present. The Norman was flattered by the assurance of an inde- 
pendent principality; and Alexius eluded, rather than denied, his far- 
ing demand of the office of great domestic, or general of the East. 
The two Roberts, the son of the conqueror of England, and the kinsman 
of three queens, 70 bowed in their turn before the Byzantine throne. 
A private letter of Stephen of Chartres attests his admiration of the 
emperor, the most excellent and liberal of men, who taught him to be- 
lieve that he was a favourite, and promised to educate and establish his 
youngest son. In his southern province, the count of St. Giles and 
Toulouse faintly recognised the supremacy of the king of France, a

sort. " - * . .

prince of a foreign nation and language. At the head of a hundred 
thousand men, he declared that he was the soldier and servant of 
Christ alone, and that the Greek might be satisfied with an equal treaty 
of alliance and friendship. His obstinate resistance enhanced the value 
and the price of his submission; and he shone, says the princess Anna, 
among the barbarians, as the sun amidst the stars of heaven. His 
disgust of the noise and insolence of the French, his suspicions of the 
designs of Bohemond, the emperor imparted to his faithful Raymond; 
and that aged statesman might clearly discern, that, however false in 
friendship, he was sincere in his enmity. 71 The spirit of chivalry was 
last subdued in the person of Tancred; and none could deem them- 
selves dishonoured by the imitation of that gallant knight. He dis- 
dained the gold and flattery of the Greek monarch; assaulted in his 
presence an insolent patrician; escaped to Asia in the habit of a private 
soldier; and yielded with a sigh to the authority of Bohemond, and the 
interest of the Christian cause. The best and most ostensible reason 
was the impossibility of passing the sea and accomplishing their vow 
without the licence and the vessels of Alexius; but they cherished a 
secret hope, that, as soon as they trod the continent of Asia, their 
swords would obliterate their shame, and dissolve the engagement, 
which on his side might not be very faithfully performed. The cere- 
mony of their homage was grateful to a people who had long since 
considered pride as the substitute of power. High on his throne the 
emperor sat mute and immovable: his majesty was adored by the 
Latin princes; aiid they submitted to kiss either his feet or his knees, 
an indignity which their own writers are ashamed to confess, and un- 
able to deny. 72 

Private or public interest suppressed the murmurs of the dukes and 
counts; but a French baron (he is supposed to be Robert of Paris T8 ) 
presumed to ascend the throne, and to place himself by the side of 
Alexius. The sage reproof of Baldwin provoked him to exclaim, in 
his barbarous idiom, " Who is this rustic, that keeps his seat while 
so many valiant captains are standing round him?" The emperor

*The proud historians of the crusades slide and stumble over this humili- 
ating step. Yet, since the heroes knelt to salute the emperor as he sat motion- 
less on his throne, it is clear that they must have kissed either his feet or 
fcnees. It is only singular that Anna should not have amply supplied the 
silence or ambiguity of the Latins. The abasement of their princes would 
have added a fine chapter to the Ceremoniale Aulse Byzantinae.

barian/ JLurtris rerv^tafjihfos, was killed, or wounded, after fighting in the front 
in the battle of Dorylaeum (1. xi. p. 317). This circumstance may justify the 
suspicion of Ducange (Not p. 362), that he was no other than Robert of 
Paris,,, of the district most peculiarly styled the Duchy or Island of France 
(L'lsle df France). 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 445 

maintained Ms silence, dissembled his indignation, and questioned his 
interpreter concerning the meaning of the words, which he partly sus- 
pected from the universal language of gesture and countenance. Be- 
fore the departure of the pilgrims he endeavoured to learn the name 
and condition of the audacious baron. " I am a Frenchman," replied 
Robert, " of the purest and most ancient nobility of my country. AH 
that I know is, that there is a church in my neighbourhood, 74 the re- 
sort of those who are desirous of approving their valour in single com- 
bat. Till an enemy appears, they address their prayers to God and 
his saints. That church I have frequently visited, but never have I 
found an antagonist who dared to accept my defiance." Alexius dis- 
missed the challenger with some prudent advice for his conduct in the 
Turkish warfare; and history repeats with pleasure this lively example 
of the manners of his age and country. 

The conquest of Asia was undertaken and achieved by Alexander, 
with thirty-five thousand Macedonians and Greeks; 75 and his best 
hope was in the strength and discipline of his phalanx of infantry. 
The principal force of the crusaders consisted in their cavalry; and 
when that force was mustered in the plains of Bithynia, the knights 
and their martial attendants on horseback amounted to one hundred 
thousand fighting men, completely armed with the helmet and coat 
of mail. The value of these soldiers deserved a strict and authentic 
account; and the flower of European chivalry might furnish, in a first 
effort, this formidable body of heavy horse. A part of the infantry 
might be enrolled for the service of scouts, pioneers, and archers; but 
the promiscuous crowd were lost in their own disorder; and we depend 
not on the eyes or knowledge, but on thfe belief and fancy, of a chap- 
lain of Count Baldwin, 76 in the estimate of six hundred thousand pil- 
grims able to bear arms, besides the priests and monks, the women 
and children, of the Latin camp. The reader starts; and before he is 
recovered from his surprise I shall add, on the same testimony, that, 
if all who took the cross had accomplished their vow, above six MIL- 
LIONS would have migrated from Europe to Asia. Under this oppres- 
sion of faith I derive some relief from a more sagacious and *WT"'

lity of the priest of Chartres, and even doubts whether the Cisalpine 
regions (in the geography of a Frenchman) were sufficient to produce 
and pour forth such incredible multitudes. The coolest scepticism will 
remember that of these religious volunteers great numbers never be- 
held Constantinople and Nice. Of enthusiasm the influence is irregu- 
lar and transient: many were detained at home by reason or cowardice, 
by poverty or weakness; and many were repulsed by the obstacles of 
the way, the more insuperable as they were unforeseen to these igno- 
rant fanatics. The savage countries of Hungary and Bulgaria were 
whitened with their bones: their vanguard was cut in pieces by the 
Turkish sultan; and the loss of the first adventure, by the sword, 
or climate, or fatigue, has already been stated at three hundred thou- 
sand men. Yet the myriads that survived, that marched, that pressed 
forwards on the holy pilgrimage, were a subject of astonishment to 
themselves and to the Greeks. The copious energy of her language 
sinks under the efforts of the princess Anna: 78 the images of locusts, 
of leaves and flowers, of the sands of the sea, or the stars of heaven, 
imperfectly represent what she had seen and heard; and the daughter 
of Alexius exclaims that Europe was loosened from its foundations, and 
hurled against Asia. The ancient hosts of Darius and Xerxes labour 
under the same doubt of a vague and indefinite magnitude; but I am in- 
clined to believe that a larger number has never been contained within 
the lines of a single camp than at the siege of Nice, the first operation 
of the Latin princes. Their motives, their characters, and their arms, 
have been already displayed. Of their troops, the most numerous por- 
tion were natives of France: the Low Countries, the banks of the 
Rhine, and Apulia sent a powerful reinforcement: some bands of ad- 
venturers were drawn from Spain, Lombardy, and England; 7 * and from 
the distant bogs and mountains of Ireland and Scotland 80 issued some 
naked and savage fanatics, ferocious at home, but unwarlike abroad. 
Had not superstition condemned the sacrilegious prudence of depriving 
the poorest or weakest Christian of the merit of the pilgrimage, the 
useless crowd, with mouths but without hands, might have been sta-

passed the British ocean (p. 143), he had confined himself to the numbers, 
families, and adventures of his countrymen. I find in Dugdale, that an English 
Norman, Stephen earl of Albemarle and Holdernesse, led the rear-guard with 
duke Robert at the battle of Antioch (Baronage, part i. p. 61).

tioned in the Greek empire till their companions had opened and se- 
cured the way of the Lord. A small remnant of the pilgrims, who 
passed the Bosphorus, was permitted to visit the holy sepulchre. Their 
northern constitution was scorched by the rays, and infected by the 
vapours, of a Syrian sun. They consumed, with heedless prodigality, 
their stores of water and provision: their numbers exhausted the inland 
country: the sea was remote, the Greeks were unfriendly, and the 
Christians of every sect fled before the voracious and cruel rapine of 
their brethren. In the dire necessity of famine, they sometimes roasted 
and devoured the flesh of their infant or adult captives. Among the 
Turks and Saracens, the idolaters of Europe were rendered more odious 
by the name and reputation of cannibals; the spies, who introduced 
themselves into the kitchen of Bohemond, were shown several human 
bodies turning on the spit: and the artful Norman encouraged a report 
which increased at the same time the abhorrence and the terror of the 
infidels. 81 

I have expatiated with pleasure on the first steps of the crusaders, 
as they paint the manners and character of Europe: but I shall abridge 
the tedious and uniform narrative of their blind achievements, which 
were performed by strength and are described by ignorance. From 
their first station in the neighbourhood of Nicomedia, they advanced 
in successive divisions; passed the contracted limit of the Greek 
empire; opened a road through the hills; and commenced, by the 
siege of his capital, their pious warfare against the Turkish sultan. 
His kingdom of Roum extended from the Hellespont to the confines 
of Syria, and barred the pilgrimage of Jerusalem: his name was Kil- 
idge-Arslan, or Soliman, 82 of the race of Seljuk, and son of the first 
conqueror; and in the defence of a land which the Turks considered as 
their own, he deserved the praise of his enemies, by whom alone he is 
known to posterity. Yielding to the first impulse of the torrent, he 
deposited his family and treasure in Nice; retired to the mountains 
with fifty thousand horse; and twice descended to assault the camps 
or quarters of the Christian besiegers, which formed an imperfect cirde 
of above six miles. The lofty and solid walls of Nice were covered 
by a deep ditch, and flanked by three hundred and seventy towers; 
and on the verge of Christendom the Moslems were trained in arms, 
and inflamed by religion. Before this city the French princes. occu-

more than his name can be found in the Mohammedan writers, who are dry

pied their stations, and prosecuted their attacks without correspondence 
or subordination: emulation prompted their valour; but their valour 
was sullied by cruelty, and their emulation degenerated into envy and 
civil discord. In the siege of Nice the arts and engines of antiquity 
were employed by the Latins; the mine and the battering-ram, the 
tortoise, and the belfry or movable turret, artificial fire, and the cata- 
pult and bdist, the sling, and the crossbow for the casting of stones 
and darts. 83 In the space of seven weeks much labour and blood 
were expended, and some progress, especially by Count Raymond, was 
made on the side of the besiegers. But the Turks could protract their 
resistance and secure their escape, as long as they were masters of the 
lake * 4 Ascanius, which stretches several miles to the westward of the 
city. The means of conquest were supplied by the prudence and in- 
dustry of Alexius; a great number of boats was transported on sledges 
from the sea to the lake; they were filled with the most dexterous of 
his archers; the flight of the sultana was intercepted; Nice was in- 
vested by land and water; and a Greek emissary persuaded the in- 
habitants to accept his master's protection, and to save themselves, 
by a timely surrender, from the rage of the savages of Europe. In 
the moment of victory, or at least of hope, the crusaders, thirsting for 
blood and plunder, were awed by the Imperial banner that streamed 
from the citadel; and Alexius guarded with jealous vigilance this im- 
portant conquest. The murmurs of the chiefs were stifled by honour 
or interest; and after a halt of nine days they directed their inarch 
towards Phrygia under the guidance of a Greek general, whom they 
suspected of a secret connivance with the sultan. The consort and the 
principal servants of Soliman had been honourably restored without 
ransom; and the emperor's generosity to the miscreants was inter- 
preted as treason to the Christian cause. 

Soliman was rather provoked than dismayed by the loss of his capi- 
tal; he admonished his subjects and allies of this strange invasion of 
the Western barbarians; the Turkish emirs obeyed the call of loyalty 
or religion, the Turkman hordes encamped round his standard, and 
his whole force is loosely stated by the Christians at two hundred, or 
even three hundred and sixty thousand horse. Yet he patiently waited 
till they had left behind them the sea and the Greet frontier, and, 
hovering on the flanks, observed their careless and confident progress 
in two columns beyond the view of each other. Some miles before

they could reach Dorylaeum in Phrygia, the left, and least numerous, 
division was surprised and attacked, and almost oppressed, by the 
Turkish cavalry. 86 The heat of the weather, the clouds of arrows, and 
the barbarous onset overwhelmed the crusaders; they lost their order 
and confidence, and the fainting fight was sustained by the personal 
valour, rather than by the military conduct, of Bohemond, Tancred, 
and Robert of Normandy. They were revived by the welcome banners 
of duke Godfrey, who flew to their succour, with the count of Ver- 
mandois and sixty thousand horse, and was followed by Raymond of 
Toulouse, the bishop of Puy, and the remainder of the sacred army. 
Without a moment's pause they formed in new order, and advanced 
to a second battle. They were received with equal resolution, and, in 
their common disdain for the unwarlike people of Greece and Asia, it 
was confessed on both sides that the Turks and the Franks were the 
only nations entitled to the appellation of soldiers. 87 Their encounter 
was varied, and balanced by the contrast of arms and discipline: of the 
direct charge and wheeling evolutions, of the couched lance and the 
brandished javelin, of a weighty broadsword and a crooked sabre, of 
cumbrous armour and thin flowing robes, and of the long Tartar bow 
and the arbdist, or crossbow, a deadly weapon, yet unknown to the 
Orientals. 88 As long as the horses were fresh, and the quivers full, 
Soliman maintained the advantage of the day, and four thousand 
Christians were pierced by the Turkish arrows. In the evening swift- 
ness yielded to strength; on either side the numbers were equal, or at 
least as great as any ground could hold, or any generals could manage; 
but, in turning the hills, the last division of Raymond and his pro- 
vincials was led, perhaps without design, on the rear of an exhausted 
enemy, and the long contest was determined. Besides a nameless and 
unaccounted multitude, three thousand pagan knights were slain in the 
battle and pursuit; the camp of Soliman was pillaged, and in the 
variety of precious spoil the curiosity of the Latins was amused with 
foreign arms and apparel, and the new aspect of dromedaries and 
camels. The importance of the victory was proved by the hasty re- 
treat of the sultan: reserving ten thousand guards of the relics of his 
army, Soliman evacuated the kingdom of Roum, and hastened to im-

plore the aid, and kindle the resentment, of his Eastern brethren. In 
a march of five hundred miles the crusaders traversed the Lesser 
Asia, through a wasted land and deserted towns, without finding either 
a friend or an enemy. The geographer 80 may trace the position of 
Dorylaeum, Antioch of Pisidia, Iconium, Archelais, and Germanicia, 
and may compare those classic appellations with the modern names of 
Eskishehr the old city, Akshehr the white city, Cogni, Erekli, and 
Marash. As the pilgrims passed over a desert, where a draught of 
water is exchanged for silver, they were tormented by intolerable 
thirst, and on the banks of the first rivulet their haste and intemperance 
were still more pernicious to the disorderly throng. They climbed with 
toil and danger the steep and slippery sides of Mount Taurus; many 
of the soldiers cast away their arms to secure their footsteps; and had 
not terror preceded their van, the long and trembling file might have 
been driven down the precipice by a handful of resolute enemies. Two 
of their most respectable chiefs, the duke of Lorraine and the count 
of Toulouse, were carried in litters; Raymond was raised, as it is said, 
by miracle, from a hopeless malady; and Godfrey had been torn by 
a bear, as he pursued that rough aiwl perilous chase in the mountains 
of Pisidia, 

To improve the general consternation, the cousin of Bohemond and 
the brother of .Godfrey were detached from the main army with their 
respective sqiaadrons of ,five and of seven hundred knights. They over- 
ran in a rapid career the hills and sea-coast of Cilicia, from Cogni to 
the Syrian gates; the Norman standard was first planted on the walls 
of Tarsus and Malmistra; but the proud injustice of Efaldwin at length 
provoked the patient and generous Italian, and they turned their con- 
secrated swords against each other in a private, and profane quarrel. 90 
Honour was the motive, and fame the reward, of Tancred, but fortune 
snuled on the more selfish enterprise of his rival. 91 He was called to 
the assistance of a Greek or Armenian tyrant, who had been suffered, 
under the Turkish yoke, to reign over the Christians of Edessa. 



* Hie curious reader may compare the classic learning of Cellarius and the 
geographical science of D'Anville. William of Tyre is tie only historian of 
the crusades who has any knowledge of antiquity; and M. Otter trod almost 
in the footsteps of the Franks from Constantinople to Antioch (Voyage en 
Turquie et en Perse, torn, L p. 35-88). 

90 [The origin of the quarrel was that Tancred, who had arrived first with 
his troops before Tarsus, persuaded the citizens to hoist his flag on the forti- 
fications. Baldwin, on his arrival, induced them, partly by threats, partly by 
promises, to haul it down and substitute his. It is singular that a similar dis- 
pute had occurred in the same-ciiy between Cassius and Dolabella during tie 
civil wars of Rome. Cf. Appian, Bell. Civ. lib. iv. cap. 8; Chronicle of 
Matthew of Edessa translated by Dulaurier, p. 218. O. S.] 

81 This detached conquest of Edessa is best represented by Fulcherius Carno- 
tensis, or of Chartres (in the collections of Bongarsius, Duchesne, and Mar- 
tenne), the valiant chaplain of Count Baldwin (Esprit des Croisades, torn. i. 
p. 13, 14). In the disputes, of that prince with Tancred, his partiality is 
encountered by the partiality of Radulphus Cadomensis, the soldier and his- 
torian of the gallant marquis. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 45* 

win accepted the character of his son and champion, but no sooner was 
he introduced into the city than he inflamed the people to the massacre 
of his father, occupied the throne and treasure, extended his conquests 
over the hills of Armenia and the plain of Mesopotamia, and founded 
the first principality of the Franks or Latins, which subsisted fifty-four 
years beyond the Euphrates. 92 

Before the Franks could enter Syria, the summer, and even the 
autumn, were completely wasted; the siege of Antioch, or the separa- 
tion and repose of the army during the winter season, was strongly 
debated in their council; the love of arms and the holy sepulchre 
urged them to advance, and reason perhaps was on the side of resolu- 
tion, since every hour of delay abates the fame and force of the in- 
vader, and multiplies the resources of defensive war. The capital of 
Syria was protected by the river Orontes, and the iron bridge of nine 
arches derives its name from the massy gates of the two towers which 
are constructed at either end. They were opened by the sword of the 
duke of Normandy; his victory gave entrance to three hundred thou- 
sand crusaders, an account which may allow some scope for losses 
and desertion, but which clearly detects much exaggeration in the re- 
view of Nice. In the description of Antioch 98 it is not easy to define 
a middle term between her ancient magnificence, under the successors 
of Alexander and Augustus, and the modern aspect of Turkish desola- 
tion. The Tetrapolis, or four cities, if they retained their name and 
position, must have left a large vacuity in a circumference of twelve 
miles; and that measure, as well as the number of four hundred 
towers, are not perfectly consistent with the five gates so often men- 
tioned in the history of the siege. Yet Antioch must have still flour- 
ished as a great and populous capital. At the head of the Turkish 
emirs, Baghisian, a veteran chief, commanded in th6 place; his garri- 
son was composed of six or seven thousand horse, and fifteen or twenty 
thousand foot; one hundred thousand Moslems are said to have fallen 
by the sword, and their numbers were propably inferior to the Greeks, 
Armenians, and Syrians, who had been no more than fourteen years 
the slaves of the house of Seljuk. From the remains of a solid and 
stately wall it appears to have arisen to the height of threescore feet 
in the valleys; and wherever less art and labour had been applied, the 
ground was supposed to be defended by the river, the morass, and the 
mountains. Notwithstanding these fortifications, the city had been 
repeatedly taken by the Persians, the Arabs, the Greeks, and the 
Turks; so large a circuit must have yielded many pervious points of 
attack, and in a siege that was formed about the middle of October the 
vigour of the execution could alone justify the boldness of the attempt.

aS* THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

Whatever strength and valour could perform in the field was abund- 
antly discharged by the champions of the cross: in the frequent occa- 
sions of sallies, of forage, of the attack and defence of convoys, they 
were often victorious; and we can only complain that their exploits 
are sometimes enlarged beyond the scale of probability and truth. The 
sword of Godfrey 94 divided a Turk from the shoulder to the haunch, 
and one half of the infidel fell to the ground, while the other was trans- 
ported by his horse to the city gate. As Robert of Normandy rode 
against his antagonist, " I devote thy head," he piously exclaimed, " to 
the demons of hell;" and that head was instantly cloven to the breast 
by the resistless stroke of his descending falchion. But the reality or 
the report of such gigantic prowess 95 must have taught the Moslems 
to keep within their walls, and against those walls of earth or stone 
the sword and the lance were unavailing weapons. In the slow and 
successive labours of a siege the crusaders were supine and ignorant, 
without skill to contrive, or money to purchase, or industry to use the 
artificial engines and implements of assault. In the conquest of Nice 
they had been powerfully assisted by the wealth and knowledge of 
the Greek emperor; his absence was poorly supplied by some Genoese 
and Pisan vessels that were attracted by religion or trade to the coast 
of Syria; the stores were scanty, the return precarious, and the com- 
munication difficult and dangerous. Indolence or weakness had pre- 
vented the Franks from investing the entire circuit, and the perpetual 
freedom of two gates relieved the wants and recruited the garrison of 
the city. At the end of seven months, after the ruin of their cavalry 
and an enormous loss by famine, desertion, and fatigue, the progress 
of the crusaders was imperceptible, and their success remote, if the 
Latin Ulysses, the artful and ambitious Bohemond, had not employed 
the arms of cunning and deceit. The Christians of Antioch were nu- 
merous and discontented: Phirouz, a Syrian renegado, had acquired the 
favour of the emir and the command of three towers, and the merit of 
his repentance disguised to the Latins, and perhaps to himself, the 
foul design of perfidy and treason. A secret correspondence, for their 
mutual interest, was soon established between Phirouz and the prince 
of Tarento; and Bohemond declared in the council of the chiefs that 
he could deliver the city into their hands. But he claimed the sover- 
eignty of Antioch as the reward of his service, and the proposal which

had been rejected by the envy, was at length extorted from the dis- 
tress, of his equals. The nocturnal surprise was executed by the 
French and Norman princes, who ascended in person the scaling- 
ladders that were thrown from the walls; their new proselyte, aftef 
the murder of his too scrupulous brother, embraced and introduced 
the servants of Christ, the army rushed through the gates, and the 
Moslems soon found that, although mercy was hopeless, resistance was 
impotent. But the citadel still refused to surrender, and the victors 
themselves were speedily encompassed and besieged by the innumerable 
forces of Kerboga, prince of Mosul, who, with twenty-eight Turkish 
emirs, advanced to the deliverance of Antioch. Five-and-twenty days 
the Christians spent on the verge of destruction, and the proud lieu- 
tenant of the caliph and the sultan left them only the choice of servi- 
tude or death. 96 In this extremity they collected the relics of their 
strength, sallied from the town, and in a single memorable day annihi- 
lated or dispersed the host of Turks and Arabians, which they might 
safely report to have consisted of six hundred thousand men. 01 Their 
supernatural allies I shall proceed to consider: the human causes of 
the victory of Antioch were the fearless despair of the Franks, and the 
surprise, the discord, perhaps the errors, of their unskilful and pre- 
sumptuous adversaries. The battle is described with as much disorder 
as it was fought; but we may observe the tent of Kerboga, a movable 
and spacious palace, enriched with the luxury of Asia, and capable of 
holding above two thousand persons; we may distinguish his three 
thousand guards who were cased, the horses as well as the men, in 
complete steel. 

In the eventful period of the siege and defence of Antioch, the cru- 
saders were alternately exalted by victory or sunk in despair; either 
swelled with plenty or emaciated with hunger. A speculative reasoner 
might suppose that their faith had a strong and serious influence on 
their practice; and that the soldiers of the cross, the deliverers of the 
holy sepulchre, prepared themselves by a sober and virtuous life for 
the daily contemplation of martyrdom. Experience blows away this 
charitable illusion; and seldom does the history of profane war display 
such scenes of intemperance and prostitution as were exhibited under 
the waUs of Antioch. The grove of Daphne no longer flourished; but 
the Syrian air was still impregnated with the same vices; the Chris-

-dans were seduced by every temptation 9S that nature either prompts 
or reprobates; the authority of the chiefs was despised; and sermons 
and edicts were alike fruitless against those scandalous disorders, not 
less pernicious to military discipline than repugnant to evangelic purity. 
In the first days of the siege and the possession of Antioch the Franks 
consumed with wanton and thoughtless prodigality the frugal subsis- 
tence of weeks and months: the desolate country no longer yielded a 
supply; and from that country they were at length excluded by the 
arms of the besieging Turks. Disease, the faithful companion of want, 
was envenomed by the rains of the winter, the summer heats, un- 
wholesome food, and the close imprisonment of multitudes. The pic- 
tures of famine and pestilence are always the same, and always dis- 
gustful; and our imagination may suggest the nature of their sufferings 
and their resources. The remains of treasure or spoil were eagerly 
lavished in the purchase of the vilest nourishment: and dreadful must 
have been the calamities of the poor, since, after paying three marks 
of silver for a goat and fifteen for a lean camel, 00 the count of Flan- 
ders was reduced to .beg a dinner, and duke Godfrey to borrow a horse. 
Sixty thousand horses had been reviewed in the camp; before the end 
of the siege they were diminishd to two thousand, and scarcely two 
hundred fit for service could be mustered on the day of battle. Weak- 
ness of body and terror of mind extinguished the ardent enthusiasm 
of the pilgrims; and every motive of honour and religion was subdued 
by the desire of life. 100 Among the chiefs, three heroes may be found 
without fear or reproach: Godfrey of Bouillon was supported by his 
magnanimous piety; Bohemond by ambition and interest; and Tancred 
declared, in the true spirit of chivalry, that, as long as he was at the 
head of forty knights, he would never relinquish the enterprise of 
Palestine. But the count of Toulouse and Provence was suspected of 
a voluntary indisposition; the duke of Normandy was recalled from 
the sea-shore by the censures of the church; Hugh the Great, though 
he led the vanguard of the battle, embraced an ambiguous opportunity 
of returning to France; and Stephen count of Chartres -basely deserted 
the standard which he bore, and the council in which he presided. The 
soldiers were discouraged by the flight of William viscount of Melun, 
surnamed the Carpenter, from the weighty strokes of his axe; and the

saints* were scandalised by the fall of Peter the Hermit, who, after arm- 
ing Europe against Asia, attempted to escape from the penance of a 
necessary fast. Of the multitude of recreant warriors, the names (says 
an historian) are blotted from the book of life; and the opprobrious 
epithet of the rope-dancers was applied to the deserters who dropped 
in the night from the walls of Antioch. The emperor Alexius, 101 who 
seemed to advance to the succour of the Latins, was dismayed by the 
assurance of their hopeless condition. They expected their fate in 
silent despair; oaths and punishments were tried without effect; and to 
rouse the soldiers to the defence of the walls, it was found necessary 
to set fire to their quarters. 

For their salvation and victory they were indebted to the same 
fanaticism which had led them to the brink of ruin. In such a cause, 
and in such an army, visions, prophecies, and miracles were frequent 
and familiar. In the distress of Antioch, they were repeated with un- 
usual energy and success: St. Ambrose had assured a pious ecclesiastic 
that two years of trial must precede the season of deliverance and 
grace; the deserters were stopped by the presence and reproaches of 
Christ himself; the dead had promised to arise and combat with their 
brethren; the Virgin had obtained the pardon of their sins; and their 
confidence was revived by a visible sign, the seasonable and splendid 
discovery of the HOLY LANCE. The policy of their chiefs has on this 
occasion been admired, and might surely be excused; but a pious 
fraud is seldom produced by the cool conspiracy of many persons; and 
a voluntary impostor might depend on the support of the wise and 
the credulity of the people. Of the diocese of Marseilles, there was a 
priest of low cunning and loose manners, and his name was Peter Bar- 
tholemy. He presented himself at the door of the council-chamber, to 
disclose an apparition of St. Andrew, which had been thrice reiterated 
in his sleep, with a dreadful menace if he presumed to suppress the 
commands of heaven. " At Antioch," said the apostle, " in the church 
of my brother St. Peter, near the high altar, is concealed the steel 
head of the lance that pierced the side of our Redeemer. In three 
days, that instrument of eternal, and now of temporal, salvation, will 
be manifested to his disciples. Search, and ye shall find: bear it aloft 
in battle; and that mystic weapon shall penetrate the souls of the mis- 
creants." The pope's legate, the bishop of Puy, affected to listen with 
coldness and distrust; but the revelation was eagerly accepted by 
Count Raymond, whom his faithful subject, in the name of the apostle, 
had chosen for the guardian of the holy lance. The experiment was 
resolved; and on the third day, after a due preparation of prayer and 
fasting, the priest of Marseilles introduced twelve trusty spectators, 
among whom were the count and his chaplain; and the church doors

were barred against the impetuous multitude. The ground was opened 
in the appointed place; but the workmen, who relieved each other, 
dug to the depth of twelve feet without discovering the object of their 
search. In the evening, when Count Raymond had withdrawn to his 
post, and the weary assistants began to murmur, Bartholemy, in his 
shirt, and without his shoes, boldly descended into the pit; the dark- 
ness of the hour and of the place enabled him to secrete and deposit the 
head of a Saracen lance; and the first sound, the first gleam, of the 
steel was saluted with a devout rapture. The holy lance was drawn 
from its recess, wrapped in a veil of silk and gold, and exposed to the 
veneration of the crusaders; their anxious suspense burst forth in a 
general shout of joy and hope, and the desponding troops were again 
inflamed with the euthusiasm of valour. Whatever had been the arts, 
and whatever might be the sentiments of the chiefs, they skilfully im- 
proved this fortunate revolution by every aid that discipline and de- 
votion could afford. The soldiers were dismissed to their quarters with 
an injunction to fortify their minds and bodies for the approaching 
conflict, freely to bestow their last pittance on themselves and their 
horses, and to expect with the dawn of day the signal of victory. On 
the festival of St. Peter and St. Paul the gates of Antioch were thrown 
open: a martial psalm, " Let the Lord arise, and let his enemies be 
scattered!" was chanted by a procession of priests and monks; the 
battle array was marshalled in twelve divisions, in honour of the twelve 
apostles; and the holy lance, in the absence of Raymond, was in- 
trusted to the hands of his chaplain. The influence of this relic or 
trophy was felt by the servants, and perhaps by the enemies, of 
Christ; 102 and its potent energy was heightened by an accident, a 
stratagem, or a rumour, of a miraculous complexion. Three knights, 
in white garments and resplendent arms, either issued, or seemed to 
issue, from the hills: the voice of Adhemar, the pope's legate, pro- 
claimed them as the martyrs St. George, St. Theodore, and St. Maurice: 
the tumult of battle allowed no time for doubt or scrutiny; and the 
welcome apparition dazzled the eyes or the imagination of a fanatic 
army. In the season of danger and triumph the revelation of Bar- 
tholemy of Marseilles was unanimously asserted; but as soon as the 
temporary service was accomplished, the personal dignity and liberal 
alms which the count of Toulouse derived from the custody of the holy 
lance provoked the envy, and awakened the reason, of his rivals. A 
Norman clerk presumed to sift, with a philosophic spirit, the truth of the 
legend, the circumstances of the discovery, and the character of the 
prophet; and the pious Bohemond ascribed their deliverance to the 
merits and intercession of Christ alone. For a while the Provincials 
defended their national palladium with clamours and arms; and new

visions condemned to death and hell the profane sceptics who pre- 
sumed to scrutinise the truth and merit of the discovery. The preva- 
lence of incredulity compelled the author to submit his life and verac- 
ity to the judgment of God. A pile of dry faggots, four feet high and 
fourteen long, was erected in the midst of the camp; the flames burnt 
fiercely to the elevation of thirty cubits; and a narrow path of twelve 
inches was left for the perilous trial. The unfortunate priest of Mar- 
seilles traversed the fire with dexterity and speed; but his thighs and 
belly were scorched by the intense heat; he expired the next day; and 
the logic of believing minds will pay some regard to his dying protesta- 
tions of innocence and truth. Some efforts were made by the Provin- 
cials to substitute a cross, a ring, or a tabernacle, in the place of the 
holy lance, which soon vanished in contempt and oblivion. 108 Yet the 
revelation of Antioch is gravely asserted by succeeding historians: and 
such is the progress of credulity, that miracles, most doubtful on the 
spot and at the moment, will be received with implicit faith at a con- 
venient distance of time and space. 

The prudence or fortune of the Franks had delayed their invasion 
till the decline of the Turkish empire. 104 Under the manly government 
of the three first sultans, the kingdoms of Asia were united in peace and 
justice; and the innumerable armies which they led in person were 
equal in courage, and superior in discipline, to the barbarians of the 
West. But at the time of the crusade, the inheritance of Malek Shah 
was disputed by his four sons; their private ambition was insensible 
of the public danger; and, in the vicissitudes of their fortune, the royal 
vassals were ignorant, or regardless, of the true object of their alle- 
giance. The twenty-eight emirs who marched with the standard of 
Kerboga were his rivals or enemies: their hasty levies were drawn from 
the towns and tents of Mesopotamia and Syria; and the Turkish vet- 
erans were employed or consumed in the civil wars beyond the Tigris. 
The caliph of Egypt embraced this opportunity of weakness and dis- 
cord to recover his ancient possessions; and his sultan Aphdal be- 
sieged Jerusalem and Tyre, expelled the children of Ortok, and re- 
stored in Palestine the civil and ecclesiastical authority of the Fati- 
mites. 105 They heard with astonishment of the vast armies of Chris- 
tians that had passed from Europe to Asia, and rejoiced in the sieges 
and battles which broke the power of the Turks, the adversaries of 

108 The two antagonists who express the most intimate knowledge and the 
strongest conviction of the miracle and of the fraud are Raymond de Agiles 
and Radulphus Cadomensis, the one attached to the count of Toulouse, the 
other to the Norman prince. Fulcherius Carnotensis presumes to say, Audite 
fraudem et non fraudem! and afterwards, Invenit lanceam, fallaciter occulta- 
tam forsitan. The rest of the herd are loud and strenuous.

their sect and monarchy. But the same Christians were the enemies 
of the prophet; and from the overthrow of Nice and Antioch, the mo- 
tive of their enterprise, which was gradually understood, would urge 
them forwards to the banks of the Jordan, or perhaps of the Nile. An 
intercourse of epistles and embassies, which rose and fell with the 
events of war, was maintained between the throne of Cairo and the 
camp of the Latins; and their adverse pride was the result of ignorance 
and enthusiasm. The ministers of Egypt declared in a haughty, or 
insinuated in a milder, tone, that their sovereign, the true and lawful 
commander of the faithful, had rescued Jerusalem from the Turkish 
yoke; and that the pilgrims, if they would divide their numbers, and 
lay aside their arms, should find a safe and hospitable reception at the 
sepulchre of Jesus. In the belief of their lost condition, the caliph 
Mostali despised their arms and imprisoned their deputies: the con- 
quest and victory of Antioch prompted him to solicit those formidable 
champions with gifts of horses and silk robes, of vases, and purses of 
gold and silver; and in his estimate of their merit or power the first 
place was assigned to Bohemond, and the second to Godfrey, In either 
fortune, the answer of the crusaders was firm and uniform: they dis- 
dained to inquire into the private claims or possessions of the followers 
of Mohammed: whatsoever was his name or nation, the usurper of 
Jerusalem was their enemy; and instead of prescribing the mode and 
terms of their pilgrimage, it was only by a timely surrender of the city 
and province, their sacred right, that he could deserve their alliance, or 
deprecate their impending and irresistible attack. 106 

Yet this attack, when they were within the view and 'reach of their 
glorious prize, was suspended above ten months after the defeat of 
Kerboga. The zeal and courage of the crusaders were chilled in the 
moment of victory; and instead of marching to improve the consterna- 
tion, they hastily dispersed to enjoy the luxury, of Syria. The causes 
of this strange delay may be found in the want of strength and subor- 
dination. In the painful and various service of Antioch the cavalry 
was annihilated; many thousands of every rank had been lost by fam- 
ine, sickness, and desertion: the same abuse of plenty had been pro- 
ductive of a third famine; and the alternative of intemperance and 
distress had generated a pestilence which swept away above fifty thou- 
sand of the pilgrims. Few were able to command, and none were will- 
ing to obey: tie domestic feuds, which had been stifled by common 
fear, were again renewed in acts, or at least in sentiments, of hostility; 
the fortune of Baldwin and Bohemond excited the envy of their com- 
pajxions; the bravest knights were enlisted for the defence of their new 
principalities; and Count Raymond exhausted his troops and treasures 
in an idle expedition into the heart of Syria. The winter was con-

writers. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE .459 

sumed in discord and disorder; a sense of honour and religion was re- 
kindled in the spring; and the private soldiers, less susceptible of am- 
bition and jealousy, awakened with angry clamours the indolence of 
their chiefs. In the month of May the relics of this mighty host pro- 
ceeded from Antioch to Laodicea: about forty thousand Latins, oi 
whom no more than fifteen hundred horse and twenty thousand foot 
were capable of immediate service. Their easy march was continued 
between Mount Libanus and the sea-shore: their wants were liberally 
supplied by the coasting traders of Genoa and Pisa; and they drew 
large contributions from the emirs of Tripoli, Tyre, Sidon, Acre, and 
Caesarea, who granted a free passage and promised to follow the ex- 
ample of Jerusalem. From Caesarea they advanced into the midland 
country: their clerks recognised the sacred geography of Lydda, Ram- 
la, Emmaus, and Bethlehem, and as soon as they descried the holy city, 
the crusaders forgot their toils and claimed their reward. 107 

Jerusalem has derived some reputation from the number and impor- 
tance of her memorable sieges. It was not till after a long and obsti- 
nate contest that Babylon and Rome could prevail against the obsti- 
nacy of the people, the craggy ground that might supersede the 
necessity of fortifications, and the walls and towers that would have 
fortified the most accessible plain. 108 These obstacles were diminished 
in the age of the crusades. The bulwarks had been completely de- 
stroyed and imperfectly restored: the Jews, their nation and worship, 
were for ever banished: but nature is less changeable than man, and 
the site of Jerusalem, though somewhat softened and somewhat re- 
moved, was still strong against the assaults of an enemy. By the 
experience of a recent siege, and a three years' possession, the Saracens 
of Egypt had been taught to discern, and in some degree to remedy, 
the defects of a place which religion as well as honour forbade them to 
resign. Aladin, or Iftikhar, the caliph's lieutenant, was intrusted with 
the defence: his policy strove to restrain the native Christians by the 
dread of their own ruin and that -of the holy sepulchre; to animate 
the Moslems by the assurance of temporal and eternal rewards. His 
garrison is said to have consisted of forty thousand Turks and Ara- 
bians; and if he could muster twenty thousand of the inhabitants, it 
must be confessed that the besieged were more numerous than the be* 
sieging army. 109 Had the diminished strength and numbers of thft

the French author of the Esprit des Croisades (torn. iv. p. 386-388), who 
observes, that, according to the Arabians, the inhabitants of Jerusalem must 
have exceeded 200,000; that, in the siege of Titus, Josephus collects 1,300,000 
Jews; that they are stated by Tacitus himself at 600,000; and that the largest

Latins allowed them to grasp the whole circumference of four thou- 
sand yards (about two English miles and a half 110 ), to what useful 
purpose should they have descended into the valley of Ben Hinnom 
and torrent of Kedron, 111 or approached the precipices of the south and 
east, from whence they had nothing either to hope or fear? Their 
siege was more reasonably directed against the northern and western 
sides of the city. Godfrey of Bouillon erected his standard on the 
first swell of Mount Calvary: to the left, as far as St. Stephen's gate, 
the line of attack was continued by Tancred and the two Roberts; and 
Count Raymond established his quarters from the citadel to the foot of 
Mount Sion, which was no longer included within the precincts of the 
city. On the fifth day the crusaders made a general assault, in the 
fanatic hope of battering down the walls without engines, and of 
scaling them without ladders. By the dint of brutal force they burst 
the first barrier, but they were driven back with shame and slaughter 
to the camp: the influence of vision and prophecy was deadened by the 
too frequent abuse of those pious stratagems; and time and labour 
were found to be the only means of victory. The time of the siege was 
indeed fulfilled in forty days, but they were forty days of calamity 
and anguish. A repetition of the old complaint of famine may be im- 
puted in some degree to the voracious or disorderly appetite of the 
Franks; but the stony soil of Jerusalem is almost destitute of water; 
the scanty springs and hasty torrents were dry in the summer season: 
nor was the thirst of the besiegers relieved, as in the city, by the arti- 
ficial supply of cisterns and aqueducts. The circumjacent country is 
equally destitute of trees for the uses of shade or building; but some 
large beams were discovered in a cave by the crusaders: a wood near 
Sichem, the enchanted grove of Tasso, 112 was cut down: the necessary 
timber was transported to the camp by the vigour and dexterity of 
Tancred; and the engines were framed by some Genoese artists, who 
had fortunately landed in the harbour of Jaffa. Two movable turrets 
were constructed at the expense, and in the stations, of the duke of 
Lorraine and the count of Toulouse, and rolled forwards with devout 

defalcation that his accepimus can justify will still leave them more numerous 
than the Roman army. 

^Maundrell, who diligently perambulated the walls, found a circuit of 
4630 paces, or 4167 English yards (p. 109, no) : from an authentic plan

^Jerusalem was possessed only of the torrent of Kedron, dry in summer, 
and of the little spring or brook of Siloe (Reland, torn. i. p 204, *oo) Both 
strangers and natives complained of the want of water, which, m time of war 
was studiously aggravated. Within the city, Tacitus mentions a perennial 
fountain, an aqueduct and cisterns for rain-water. The aqueduct was con- 
veyed from foe nvulet Tekoe or Etham, which is likewise mentioned by Bbha- 
din (in Vit Saladin. p. 238).

labour, not to the most accessible, but to the most neglected, parts of 
the fortification. Raymond's tower was reduced to ashes by the fire of 
the besieged, but his colleague was more vigilant and successful; the 
enemies were driven by his archers from the rampart; the drawbridge 
was let down; and on a Friday, at three in the afternoon, the day and 
hour of the Passion, Godfrey of Bouillon stood victorious on the walls 
of Jerusalem. His example was followed on every side by the emula- 
tion of valour; and about four hundred and sixty years after the con- 
quest of Omar, the holy city was rescued from the Mohammedan yoke. 
In the pillage of public and private wealth, the adventurers had agreed 
to respect the exclusive property of the first occupant; and the spoils 
of the great mosque, seventy lamps and massy vases of gold and silver, 
rewarded the diligence, and displayed the generosity, of Tancred. A 
bloody sacrifice was offered by his jaistaken votaries to the God of the 
Christians: resistance might provoke, but neither age nor sex could 
mollify, their implacable rage: they indulged themselves three days 
in a promiscuous massacre; 118 and the infection of the dead bodies 
produced an epidemical disease. After seventy thousand Moslems had 
been put to the sword, and the harmless Jews had been burnt in their 
synagogue, they could still reserve a multitude of captives whom in- 
terest or lassitude persuaded them to spare. Of these savage heroes 
of the cross, Tancred alone betrayed some sentiments of compassion; 
yet we may praise the more selfish lenity of Raymond, who granted a 
capitulation and safe-conduct to the garrison of the citadel. 11 * The 
holy sepulchre was now free; and the bloody victors prepared to ac- 
complish their vow. Bareheaded and barefoot, with contrite hearts 
and in a humble posture, they ascended the hill of Calvary, amidst the 
loud anthems of the dergy; kissed the stone which had covered the 
Saviour of the world; and bedewed with tears of joy and penitence the 
monument of their redemption. This union of the fiercest and most 
tender passions has been variously considered by two philosophers: 
by the one, 115 as easy and natural; by the other, 114 as absurd and in- 
credible. Perhaps it is too rigorously applied to the same persons and 
the same hour: the example of the virtuous Godfrey awakened the piety 
of his companions; while they cleansed their bodies they purified their 
minds; nor shall I believe that the most ardent in slaughter and rapine 
were die foremost in the procession to the holy sepulchre.

live to hear, the Latin chiefs proceeded to the election of a king, to 
guard and govern their conquests in Palestine. Hugh the Great and 
Stephen of Chartres had retired with some loss of reputation, which 
they strove to regain by a second crusade and an honourable death. 
Baldwin was established at Edessa, and Bohemond at Antioch; and 
two Roberts, the duke of Normandy 117 and the count of Flanders, pre- 
ferred their fair inheritance in the West to a doubtful competition or 
a barren sceptre. The jealousy and ambition of Raymond were con- 
demned by his own followers, and the free, the just, the unanimous 
voice of the army proclaimed Godfrey of Bouillon the first and most 
worthy of the champions of Christendom. His magnanimity accepted 
a trust as full of danger as of glory; but in a city where his Saviour 
had been crowned with thorns, the devout pilgrim rejected the name 
and ensigns of royalty; and the founder of the kingdom of Jerusalem 
contented himself with the modest title of Defender and Baron of the 
Holy Sepulchre. His government of a single year, 118 too short for the 
public happiness, was interrupted in the first fortnight by a summons 
to the field, by the approach of the vizir or sultan of Egypt, who had 
been too slow to prevent, but who was impatient to avenge, the loss of 
Jenisalem. His total overthrow in the battle of Ascalon sealed the 
establishment of the Lathis in Syria, and signalised the valour of the 
French princes, who in this action bade a long farewell to the holy 
wars. Some glory might be derived from the prodigious inequality of 
numbers, though I shall not count the myriads of horse and foot on the 
side of the Fatimites; but, except three thousand Ethiopians or Blacks, 
who were armed with flails or scourges of iron, the barbarians of the 
South fled on the first onset, and afforded a pleasing comparison be- 
tween the active valour of the Turks and the sloth and effeminacy of 
the natives of Egypt. After suspending before the holy sepulchre the 
sword and standard of the sultan, the new king (he deserves the title) 
embraced his departing companions, and could retain only with the 
gallant Tancred three hundred knights, and two thousand foot soldiers, 
for the defence of Palestine. His sovereignty was soon attacked by a 
new enemy, the only one against whom Godfrey was a coward. Adhe- 
mar, bishop of Puy, who excelled both in council and action, had been 
swept away in the last plague of Antioch: the remaining ecclesiastics 
preserved only the pride and avarice of their character; and their se- 
ditious clamours had required that the choice of a bishop should pre- 
cede that of a king. The revenue and jurisdiction of the lawful patri- 
arch were usurped by the Latin clergy: the exclusion of the Greeks 
and Syrians was justified by the reproach of heresy or schism; 118 and,

under the iron yoke of their deliverers, the Oriental Christians re- 
gretted the tolerating government of the Arabian caliphs. Daimbert^ 
archbishop of Pisa, had long been trained in the secret policy of Rome: 
he brought a fleet of his countrymen to the succour of the Holy Land, 
and was installed, without a competitor, the spiritual and temporal head 
of the church. The new patriarch 12 immediately grasped the sceptre 
which had been acquired by the toil and blood of the victorious pil- 
grims; and both Godfrey and Bohemond submitted to receive at his 
hands the investiture of their feudal possessions. Nor was this suffi- 
cient; Daimbert claimed the immediate property of Jerusalem and 
Jaffa; instead of a firm and generous refusal, the hero negotiated with 
the priest; a quarter of either city was ceded to the church; and the 
modest bishop was satisfied with an eventual reversion of the rest, on 
the death of Godfrey without children, or on the future acquisition of 
a new seat at Cairo or Damascus. 

Without this indulgence the conqueror would have almost been 
stripped of his infant kingdom, which consisted only of Jerusalem and 
Jaffa, with about twenty villages and towns of the adjacent country. 121 
Within this narrow verge the Mohammedans were still lodged in some 
impregnable castles; and the husbandman, the trader, and the pilgrim 
were exposed to daily and domestic hostility. By the arms of Godfrey 
limself, and of the two Baldwins, his brother and cousin, who suc- 
ceeded to the throne, the Latins breathed with more ease and safety; 
and at length they equalled, in the extent of their dominions, though 
not in the millions of their subjects, the ancient princes of Judah and 
Israel. 122 After the reduction of the maritime cities of Laodicea, Trip- 
oli, Tyre, and Ascalon, 123 which were powerfully assisted by the fleets 
of Venice, Genoa, and Pisa, and even of Flanders and Norway, 124 the

sessed by the Christian pilgrims. If the prince of Antioch disclaimed 
his supremacy, the counts of Edessa and Tripoli owned themselves the 
vassals of the king of Jerusalem: the Latins reigned beyond the Eu- 
phrates; and the four cities of Hems, Hamah, Damascus, and Aleppo 
were the only relics of the Mohammedan conquests in Syria. 125 The 
laws and language, the manners and titles, of the French nation and 
Latin church, were introduced into these transmarine colonies. Ac- 
cording to the feudal jurisprudence, the principal states and subordi- 
nate baronies descended in the line of male and female succession: 126 
but the children of the first conquerors, 127 a motley and degenerate 
race, were dissolved by the luxury of the climate; the arrival of new 
crusaders from Europe was a doubtful hope and a casual event. The 
service of the feudal tenures 12S was performed by six hundred and 
sixty-six knights, who might expect the aid of two hundred more under 
the banner of the count of Tripoli; and each knight was attended to 
the field by four squires or archers on horseback. 129 Five thousand 
and seventy-five Serjeants, most probably foot-soldiers, were supplied 
by the churches and cities; and the whole legal militia of the kingdom 
could not exceed eleven thousand men, a slender defence against the 
surrounding myriads of Saracens and Turks. 180 But the firmest bul- 
wark of Jerusalem was founded on the knights of the Hospital of St. 
John, 181 and of the temple of Solomon; 132 on the strange association

the ineffectual struggles of Pagi, Critica, A.D. 1099, No. 14-18). They assumed 
the profession of arms about the year 1120; fee Hospital was mater; the 
Temple filia; the Teutonic order was founded A.D. 1190, at the siege of Acre 
(Mosl^eim, Ingtitut p. 389, 390).

of a monastic and military life, which fanaticism might suggest, but 
which policy must approve. The flower of the nobility of Europe as- 
pired to wear the cross, and to profess the vows, of these respectable 
orders; their spirit and discipline were immortal; and the speedy dona- 
tion of twenty-eight thousand farms, or manors, 133 enabled them to 
support a regular force of cavalry and infantry for the defence of Pal- 
estine. The austerity of the convent soon evaporated in the exercise 
of arms: the world was scandalised by the pride, avarice, and corrup- 
tion of these Christian soldiers; their claims of immunity and juris- 
diction disturbed the harmony of the church and state; and the public 
peace was endangered by their jealous emulation. But in their most 
dissolute period the knights of the hospital and temple maintained 
their fearless and fanatic character: they neglected to live, but they 
were prepared to die, in the service of Christ; and the spirit of chivalry, 
the parent and offspring of the crusades, has been transplanted by this 
institution from the holy sepulchre to the isle of Malta. 13 * 

The spirit of freedom, which pervades the feudal institutions, was 
felt in its strongest energy by the volunteers of the cross, who elected 
for their chief the most deserving of his peers. Amidst the slaves of 
Asia, unconscious of the lesson or example, a model of political liberty 
was introduced; and the laws of the French kingdom are derived from 
the purest source of 'equality and justice. Of such laws, the first and 
indispensable condition is the assent of those whose obedience they re- 
quire, and for whose benefit they are designed. No sooner had God- 
frey of Bouillon accepted the office of supreme magistrate than he 
solicited the public and private advice of the Latin pilgrims who were 
the best skilled in the statutes and customs of Europe. From these 
materials, with the counsel and approbation of the patriarch and 
barons, of the clergy and laity, Godfrey composed the ASSISE OF JE- 
RUSALEM, 135 a precious monument of feudal jurisprudence. The new 
code, attested by the seals of the king, the patriarch, and the viscount 
of Jerusalem, was deposited in the holy sepulchre, enriched with the 
improvements of succeeding times, and respectfully consulted as often 

in Opp. torn. i. p. ii. p. 547-563, edit. Mabillon, Venet 1750. Such an enco- 
mium, which is thrown away on the dead Templars, would be highly valued 
by the historians of Malta. 

w Matthew Paris, Hist Major, p. 544, He assigns to the Hospitalers 
19,000, to the Templars 9000 maneria, a word of much higher import (as 
Ducange has rightly observed) in the English than in the French idiom. 
Manor is a lordship, memoir a dwelling. 

^In the three first books of the Histoire des Chevaliers de Malthe, par 
1'Abbe de Vertot, the reader may amuse himself with a fair, and sometimes 
flattering, picture of the order, while it was employed for the defence of Pal- 
estine. The subsequent books pursue their emigrations to Rhodes and Malta. 

138 The Assises de Jerusalem, in old law French, were printed with Beau- 
manoir's Coutumes de Beauvoisis (Bourses and Paris, 1690, in folio), and 
illustrated by Gaspard Thaumas de la Thaumassiere with a comment and 
glossary. An Italian version had been published in 1535, at Venice, for the 
nse of the kingdom of Cyprus. 



466 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

as any doubtful question arose in the tribunals of Palestine. With the 
kingdom and city all was lost; 130 the fragments of the written law were 
preserved by jealous tradition 137 and variable practice till the middle 
of the thirteenth century: the code was restored by the pen of John 
d'lbelin, count of Jaffa, one of the principal feudatories; 138 and the 
final revision was accomplished in the year thirteen hundred and sixty- 
nine, for the use of the Latin kingdom of Cyprus. 130 

The justice and freedom of the constitution were maintained by two 
tribunals of unequal dignity, which were instituted by Godfrey of 
Bouillon after the conquest of Jerusalem. The king, in person, pre- 
sided in the upper court, the court of the barons. Of these the four 
most conspicuous were the prince of Galilee, the lord of Sidon and 
Caesarea, and the counts of Jaffa and Tripoli, who, perhaps with the 
constable and marshal, 140 were in a special manner the compeers and 
judges of each other. But all the nobles who held their lands immedi- 
ately of the crown were entitled and bound to attend the king's court; 
and each baron exercised a similar jurisdiction in the subordinate as- 
semblies of his own feudatories. The connection of lord and vassal 
was honourable and voluntary: reverence was due to the benefactor, 
protection to the dependent; but they mutually pledged their faith to 
each other; and the obligation on either side might be suspended by 
neglect or dissolved by injury. The cognisance of marriages and 
testaments was blended with religion, and usurped by the clergy: but 
the civil and criminal causes of the nobles, the inheritance and tenure 
of their fiefs, formed the proper occupation of the supreme court. Each 
member was the judge and guardian both of public and private rights. 
It was his duty to assert with his tongue and sword the lawful claims 

538 A la terre perdue, tout fut perdu, is the vigorous expression of the Assise 
(c. 281). Yet Jerusalem capitulated with Saladin; the queen and the principal 
Christians departed in peace; and a code so precious and so portable could not 
provoke the avarice of the conquerors. I have sometimes suspected the 
existence of this original copy of the Holy Sepulchre, which might be invented 
to sanctify and authenticate the traditionary customs of the French in Pal- 
estine. 

337 A noble lawyer, Raoul de Tabarie, denied the prayer of king Amauri 
(AJ&gt;. 1195-1205), that he would commit his knowledge to writing, and frankly 
declared, que de ce qu'il savoit ne feroit-il ja nul borjois son pareill, ne nul 
sage homme lettre (c. 281). 

338 The compiler of this work, Jean d'Ibelin, was count of Jaffa and Ascalon, 
lord of Baruth (Berytus) and Raines, and died A.D. 1266 (Sanut. 1. iii. p. xii. 
c. 5, 8 [p. 220, 222] ) . The family of Ibelin, which descended from a younger 
brother of a count of dartres in France, long flourished in Palestine and 
Cyprus (see the Lignages de deca Mer, or d'Outremer, c. 6, at the end of the 
Assises de Jerusalem, an original book, which records the pedigrees of the 
French adventurers). 

w By sixteen commissioners chosen in the states of the island: the work was 
finished the 3rd of ]Sfovember, 1369, sealed with four seals, and deposited in 
the cathedral of Nicosia (see the preface to the Assises). 

140 The cautious John d'Ibelin argues, rather than affirms, that Tripoli is 
the fourth barony, and expresses some doubt concerning the right or preten- 
sion of the constable and marshal ([Assises de Jrus.l c. 324). 



TTHE RCMAN EMPIRE 467 

of the lord: but if an unjust superior presumed to violate the freedom 
or property of a vassal, the confederate peers stood forth to maintain 
his quarrel by word and deed. They boldly affirmed his innocence 
and his wrongs; demanded the restitution of his liberty and his lands; 
suspended, after a fruitless demand, their own service; rescued their 
brother from prison; and employed every weapon in his defence, with- 
out offering direct violence to the person of their lord, which was ever 
sacred in their eyes. 141 In their pleadings, replies, and rejoinders, the 
advocates of the court were subtle and copious; but the use of argu- 
ment and evidence was often superseded by judicial combat; and the 
Assise of Jerusalem admits in many cases this barbarous institution, 
which has been slowly abolished by the laws and manners of Europe. 
The trial by battle was established in all criminal cases which 
affected the life, or limb, or honour of any person; and in all civil 
transactions of or above the value of one mark of silver. It appears 
that in criminal cases the combat was the privilege of the accuser, who, 
except in a charge of treason, avenged his personal injury, or the death 
of those persons whom he had a right to represent; but wherever, 
from the nature of the charge, testimony could be obtained, it was 
necessary for him to produce witnesses of the fact. In civil cases the 
combat was not allowed as the means of establishing the claim of the 
demandant, but he was obliged to produce witnesses who had, or as- 
sumed to have, knowledge of the fact. The combat was then the 
privilege of the defendant, because he charged the witness with an 
attempt by per jury o take away his right. He came therefore to be in 
the same situation as the appellant in criminal cases. It was not, then, 
as a mode of proof that the combat was received, nor as mating ne S a - 
tive evidence (according to the supposition of Montesquieu); 1 * 2 bul 
in every case the right to offer battle was founded on the right to 
pursue by arms the redress of an injury, and the judicial combat was 
fought on the same principle and with the same spirit as a private duel. 
Champions were only allowed to women, and to men maimed or past 
the age of sixty. The consequence of a defeat was death to the per- 
son accused, or to the champion or witness, as well as to the accuser 
himself; but in civil cases the demandant was punished with infamy 
and the loss of his suit, while his witness and champion suffered an 
ignominious death. In many cases it was is the option of the judge 
to award or to refuse the combat: but two are specified in which it was

ceived with the noble simplicity of freedom.

the inevitable result of the challenge; if a faithful vassal gave the lie 
to his compeer who unjustly claimed any portion of their lord's de- 
mesnes, or if an unsuccessful suitor presumed to impeach the judg- 
ment and veracity of the court. He might impeach them, but the 
terms were severe and perilous; in the same day he successfully fought 
all the members of the tribunal, even those who had been absent; a 
single defeat was followed by death and infamy, and where none could 
hope for victory it is highly probable that none would adventure the 
trial. In the Assise of Jerusalem, the legal subtlety of the count of 
Jaffa is more laudably employed to elude, than to facilitate, the judi- 
cial combat, which he derives from a principle of honour rather than of 
superstition. 148 

Among the causes which enfranchised the plebeians from the yoke 
of feudal tyranny, the institution of cities and corporations is one of 
the most powerful; and if those of Palestine are coeval with the first 
crusade, they may be ranked with the most ancient of the Latin world. 
Many of the pilgrims had escaped from their lords under the banner 
of the cross, and it was the policy of the French princes to tempt their 
stay by the assurance of the rights and privileges of freemen. It is 
expressly declared in the Assise of Jerusalem, that after instituting, 
for his knights and barons, the court of peers, in which he presided him- 
self, Godfrey of Bouillon established a second tribunal, in which his 
person was represented by his viscount. The jurisdiction of this in- 
ferior court extended over the burgesses of the kingdom, and it was 
composed of a select number of the most discreet and worthy citizens, 
who were sworn to judge, according to the laws, of the actions and for- 
tunes of their equals. 144 In the conquest and settlement of new cities, 
the example of Jerusalem was imitated by the kings and their great 
vassals, and above thirty similar corporations were founded before the 
loss of the Holy Land. Another dass of subjects, the Syrians, 145 or 
Oriental Christians, were oppressed by the zeal of the clergy, and pro- 
tected by the toleration of the state. Godfrey listened to their reason- 
able prayer that they might be judged by their own national laws. A 
third court was instituted for their use, of limited and domestic juris- 
diction; the sworn members were Syrians, in blood, language, and re-

and [ (uscerning eye, has surveyed the philosophic history of law. By his 
studies posterity might be enriched: the merit of the orator and the judge can 
be felt only by his contemporaries. 

144 Louis le Gros, who is considered as the father of this institution in 
France, did not begin his reign till nine years (A.D. 1108) after Godfrey of 
Bouillon (Assises, c. 2, 324). For its origin and effects see the judicious 
remarks of Dr. Robertson (History of Charles V. vol. i. p. 30-36, 251-265,

ligion, but the office of the president (in Arabic, of the rais) was some- 
times exercised by the viscount of the city. At an immeasurable 
distance below the nobles, the burgesses, and the strangers, the Assise 
of Jerusalem condescends to mention the villains and slaves, the peas- 
ants of the land and the captives of war, who were almost equally 
considered as the objects of property. The relief or protection of 
these unhappy men was not esteemed worthy of the care of the legis- 
lator: but he diligently provides for the recovery, though not indeed 
for the punishment, of the fugitives. Like hounds or hawks, who nad 
strayed from the lawful owner, they might be lost and claimed; the 
slave and falcon were of the same value, but three slaves or twelve 
oxen were accumulated to equal the price of the war-horse, and a sum 
of three hundred pieces of gold was fixed, in the age of chivalry, as the 
equivalent of the more noble animal. 146

IN a style less grave than that of history I should perhaps compare 
the emperor Alexius * to the jackal, who is said to follow the steps, and 
to devour the leavings, of the lion. Whatever had been his fears and 
toils in the passage of the first crusade, they were amply recompensed 
by the subsequent benefits which he derived from the exploits of the 
Franks. His dexterity and vigilance secured their first conquest of 
Nice, and from this threatening station the Turks were compelled to 
evacuate the neighbourhood of Constantinople. While the crusaders, 
with blind valour, advanced into the midland countries of Asia, the 
crafty Greek improved the favourable occasion when the emirs of the 
sea-coast were recalled to the standard of the sultan. The Turks were 
driven from the isles of Rhodes and Chios: the cities of Ephesus and 
Smyrna, of Sardes, Philadelphia, and Laodicea, were restored to the 
empire, which Alexius enlarged from the Hellespont to the banks of the 
Mzeander and the rocky shores of Pamphylia. The churches resumed 

See the Assises de Jerusalem (c. 310, 311, 312). These laws were enacted 
as late as the year 1350, in the kingdom of Cyprus. In the same century, in 
the reign of EdwaH I., I understand, from a late publication (of his Book 
of Account), that the price of a war-horse was not less exorbitant in England.

their splendour, the towns were rebuilt and fortified, and the desert 
country was peopled with colonies of Christians, who were gently re- 
moved from the more distant and dangerous frontier. In these pa- 
ternal cares we may forgive Alexius if he forgot the deliverance of the 
holy sepulchre; but by the Latins he was stigmatised with the foul 
reproach of treason and desertion. They had sworn fidelity and 
obedience to his throne, but he had promised to assist their enterprise 
in person, or, at least, with his troops and treasures; his base retreat 
dissolved their obligations; and the sword, which had been the in- 
strument of their victory, was the pledge and title of their just inde- 
pendence. It does not appear that the emperor attempted to revive his 
obsolete claims over the kingdom of Jerusalem, 2 but the borders of 
Cilicia and Syria were more recent in his possession, and more acces- 
sible to his arms. The great army of the crusaders was annihilated or 
dispersed; the principality of Antioch was left without a head by the 
surprise and captivity of Bohemond; his ransom had oppressed him 
with a heavy debt, and his Norman followers were insufficient to repel 
the hostilities of the Greeks and Turks. In this distress Bohemond 
embraced a magnanimous resolution of leaving the defence of Antioch 
to his kinsman the faithful Tancred, of arming the West against the 
Byzantine empire, and of executing the design which he inherited from 
the lessons and example of his father Guiscard. His embarkation was 
clandestine, and, if we may credit a tale of the princess Anna, he passed 
the hostile sea closely secreted in a coffin. 8 But his reception in France 
was dignified by the public applause and his marriage with the king's 
daughter; his return was glorious, since the bravest spirits of the age 
enlisted under his veteran command; and he repassed the Adriatic at 
the head of five thousand horse and forty thousand foot, assembled 
from the most remote climates of Europe. 4 The strength of Durazzo 
and prudence of Alexius, the progress of famine and approach of win- 
ter, eluded his ambitious hopes, and the venal confederates were se- 
duced from his standard. A treaty of peace 6 suspended the fears of 
the Greeks, and they were finally delivered by the death of an adver- 
sary whom neither oaths could bind, nor dangers could appal, nor 
prosperity could satiate. His children succeeded to the principality 

2 The kings of Jerusalem submitted however to a nominal dependence, and 
in the dates of their inscriptions (one is still legible in the church of Bethlehem) 
they respectfully placed before their own the name of the reigning emperor 
(Ducange, Dissertations sur Joinville, xxvii. p. 319). 

Anna Cpmnena adds [1. xi. p. 341], that, to complete the imitation, he was 
tout up with a dead cock; and condescends to wonder how the barbarian 
fould. endure the confinement and putrefaction. This absurd tale is unknown

The copy of the treaty (Alexiad, L xiii. p. 406-416) is an original and curi- 
ous piece, which would require, and might afford, a good man of the prin- 
cipalit of Antioch.

of Antioch, but the boundaries were strictly defined, the homage was 
clearly stipulated, and the cities of Tarsus and Malmistra were re- 
stored to the Byzanthie emperors. Of the coast of Anatolia, they 
possessed the entire circuit from Trebizond to the Syrian gates. The 
Sdjukian dynasty of Roum s was separated on all sides from the sea 
and their Musulman brethren; the power of the sultans was shaken 
by the victories and even the defeats of the Franks; and after the 
loss of Nice they removed their throne to Cogni or Iconium, an ob- 
scure and inland town above three hundred miles from Constantinople. 7 
Instead of trembling for their capital, the Comnenian princes waged 
an offensive war against the Turks, and the first crusade prevented the 
fall of the declining empire. 

In the twelfth century three great emigrations marched by land from 
the West to the relief of Palestine. The soldiers and pilgrims of Lom- 
bardy, France, and Germany were excited by the example and success 
of the first crusade. 8 Forty-eight years after the deliverance of the 
holy sepulchre, the emperor and the French king, Conrad the Third 
and Louis the Seventh, undertook the second crusade to support the 
falling fortunes of the Latins. 9 A grand division of the third crusade 
was led by the emperor Frederic Barbarossa, 10 who sympathised with 
his brothers of France and England in the common loss of Jerusalem. 
These three expeditions may be compared, in their resemblance of the 
greatness of numbers, their passage through the Greek empire, and the 
nature and event of their Turkish warfare; and a brief parallel may 
save the repetition of a tedious narrative. However splendid it may

regardless of the affairs of Roum. 

7 Iconium is mentioned as a station by Xenpphon, and by Strabo with the 
ambiguous title of Kw/i6iroX (Cellarius, torn. ii. p. 121). Yet St. Paul found 
in that place a multitude (irX^tfos) of Jews and Gentiles. Under the corrupt 
name of Kunijah, it is described as a great city, with a river and gardens, 
three leagues from the mountains, and decorated (I know not why) with 
Plato's tomb (Abulfeda, tabul. xvii. p. 303, vers. Reiske; and the Index Geo-

seem, a regular story of the crusades would exhibit the perpetual return 
of the same causes and effects, and the frequent attempts for the de- 
fence or recovery of the Holy Land would appear so many faint and 
unsuccessful copies of the original. 

I. Of the swarms that so closely trod in the footsteps of the first 
pilgrims, the chiefs were equal in rank, though unequal in fame and 
merit, to Godfrey of Bouillon and his fellow adventurers. At their 
head were displayed the banners of the dukes of Burgundy, Bavaria, 
and Aquitain: the first a descendant of Hugh Capet, the second a 
father of the Brunswick line; the archbishop of Milan, a temporal 
prince, transported, for the benefit of the Turks, the treasures and 
ornaments of his church and palace; and the veteran crusaders, Hugh 
the Great and Stephen of Chartres, returned to consummate their un- 
finished vow. The huge and disorderly bodies of their followers moved 
forwards in two columns; and if the first consisted of two hundred and 
sixty thousand persons, the second might possibly amount to sixty 
thousand horse and one hundred thousand foot. 11 The armies of the 
second crusade might have claimed the conquest of Asia; the nobles 
of France and Germany were animated by the presence of their sover- 
eigns, and both the rank and personal characters of Conrad and Louis 
gave a dignity to their cause, and a discipline to their force, which 
might be vainly expected from the feudatory chiefs. The cavalry of 
the emperor and that of the king was each composed of seventy thou- 
sand knights and their immediate attendants in the field; 12 and if the 
light-armed troops, the peasant infantry, the women and children, the 
priests and monks, be rigorously excluded, the full account will scarcely 
be satisfied with four hundred thousand souls. The West, from Rome 
to Britain, was called into action; the kings of Poland and Bohemia 
obeyed the summons of Conrad; and it is affirmed by the Greeks and 
Latins, that, in the passage of a strait or river, the Byzantine agents, 
after a tale of nine hundred thousand, desisted from the endless and 
formidable computation. 18 In the third crusade, as the French and 
English preferred the navigation of the Mediterranean, the host of 
Frederic Barbarossa was less numerous. Fifteen thousand knights and 
as many squires were the flower of the German chivalry; sixty thou- 

11 Anna, who states these later swarms at 40,000 horse and 100,000 foot, calls 
them Normans, and places at their head two brothers of Flanders. The 
Greeks were strangely ignorant of the names, families, and possessions of the 
Latin princes. 

"William of Tyre, and Matthew Paris, reckon 70,000 loricati in each of 
the armies. 

"The imperfect enumeration is mentioned by Cinnamus (evvcv/iovTa pvpiahs 
[p. 69, ed. Bonn]), and confirmed by Odo de Diogilo apud Ducange ad Cinna- 
mum, with the more precise sum of 900,556. Why must therefore the version 
and comment suppose the modest and insufficient reckoning of 90,000? Does 
not Godfrey of Viterbo (Pantheon, p. xix. in Muratori, torn. vii. p. 462) 
exclaim 

Numerum si noscere quaeras, 

Millia millena militis agmen erat 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 473 

sand horse and one hundred thousand foot were mustered by the em- 
peror in the plains of Hungary; and after such repetitions we shall no 
longer be startled at the six hundred thousand pilgrims which credulity 
has ascribed to this last emigration. 1 * Such extravagant reckonings 
prove only the astonishment of contemporaries, but their astonishment 
most strongly bears testimony to the existence of an enormous though 
indefinite mutitude. The Greeks might applaud their superior knowl- 
edge o* the arts and stratagems of war, but they confessed the strength 
and courage of the French cavalry and the infantry of the Germans; 15 
and the strangers are described as an iron race, of gigantic stature, who 
darted fire from their eyes, and spilt blood like water on the ground. 
Under the banners of Conrad a troop of females rode in the attitude 
and armour of men, and the chief of these Amazons, from her gilt spurs 
and buskins, obtained the epithet of the Golden-footed Dame. 

II. The numbers and character of the strangers was an object of 
terror to the effeminate Greeks, and the sentiment of fear is nearly 
allied to that of hatred. This aversion was suspended or softened by 
the apprehension of the Turkish power; and the invectives of the 
Latins will not bias our more candid belief that the emperor Alexius 
dissembled their insolence, eluded their hostilities, counselled their 
rashness, and opened to their ardour the road of pilgrimage and con- 
quest. But when the Turks had been driven from Nice and the sea- 
coast, when the Byzantine princes no longer dreaded the distant sul- 
tans of Cogni, they felt with purer indignation the free and frequent 
passage of the Western barbarians, who violated the majesty and en- 
dangered the safety of the empire. The second and third crusades 
were undertaken under the reign of Manuel Comnenus and Isaac An- 
gelus. Of the former, the passions were always impetuous, and often 
malevolent; and the natural union of a cowardly and a mischievous 
temper was exemplified in the latter, who, without merit or mercy, 
could punish a tyrant and occupy his throne. It was secretly, and per- 
haps tacitly, resolved by the prince and people to destroy, or at least 
to discourage, the pilgrims by every species of injury and oppression; 
and their want of prudence and discipline continually afforded the 
pretence or the opportunity. The Western monarchs had stipulated a 
safe passage and fair market in the country of their Christian brethren; 
the treaty had been ratified by oaths and hostages; and the poorest 
soldier of Frederic's army was furnished with three marks of silver to

defray his expenses on the road. But every engagement was violate^ 
by treachery and injustice; and the complaints of the Latins are at- 
tested by the honest confession of a Greek historian, who has dared to 
prefer truth to his country. 16 Instead of an hospitable reception, the 
gates of the cities, both in Europe and Asia, were closely barred against 
the crusaders; and the scanty pittance of food was let down in baskets 
from the walls. Experience or foresight might excuse this timid jeal- 
ousy; but the common duties of humanity prohibited the mixture of 
chalk, or other poisonous ingredients, in the bread; and should Manuel 
be acquitted of any foul connivance, he is guilty of coining base 
money for the purpose of trading with the pilgrims. In every step of 
their march they were stopped or misled: the governors had private 
orders to fortify the passes and break down the bridges against them: 
the stragglers were pillaged and murdered: the soldiers and horses were 
pierced in the woods by arrows from an invisible hand; the sick were 
burnt in their beds; and the dead bodies were hung on gibbets along 
the highways. These injuries exasperated the champions of the cross, 
who were not endowed with evangelical patience; and the Byzantine 
princes, who had provoked the unequal conflict/ promoted the embarka- 
tion and inarch of these formidable guests. On the verge of the Turk- 
ish frontier Barbarossa spared the, guilty Philadelphia, 17 rewarded the 
hospitable Laodicea, and deplored the hard necessity that had stained 
his sword with any drops of Christian blood. In the;r intercourse with 
the moaarcfas of Germany and France, the pride of the Greeks was 
exposed to an anxious trial. They might boast that on tie first inter- 
view the seat of Louis was a low stool beside the throne of -Manuel; 18 
but no sooner had the French king transported his army beyond the 
Bosphonjs than he refused the offer of a second conference unless his 
brother would meet him on equal terms either on the sea or land. 
With Conrad and Frederic the ceremonial was still nicer and more 
difficult: like the successors of Constantino, they styled themselves em- 
perors of the Romans, 19 and firmly maintained the purity of their title 
and dignity. The first of these representatives of Charlemagne would

against the Franks the important post of Philippopolis. Cinnamus is infected 
with national prejudice and pride.

mous German accuses the rudeness of his countrymen (culpa nostra). His- 
tory would be pleasant if we were embarrassed only by such contradictions.

Frederic.

only converse with Manuel on horseback in the open field; the sec- 
ond, by passing the Hellespont rather than the Bosphorus, declined the 
view of Constantinople and its sovereign. An emperor who had been 
crowned at Rome was reduced in the Greek epistles to the humble ap- 
pellation of Rex, or prince, of the Alemanni; and the vain and feeble 
Angelus affected to be ignorant of the name of one of the greatest men 
and monarchs of the age. While they viewed with hatred and suspicion 
the Latin pilgrims, the Greek emperors maintained a strict, though 
secret, alliance with the Turks and Saracens. Isaac Angelus complained 
that by his friendship for the great Saladin he had incurred the enmity 
of the Franks ; and a mosque was founded at Constantinople for the pub- 
lic exercise of the religion of Mohammed. 20 

III. The swarms that followed the first crusade were destroyed in 
Anatolia by famine, pestilence, and the Turkish arrows; and the princes 
only escaped with some squadrons of horse to accomplish their lament- 
able pilgrimage. A just opinion may be formed of their knowledge and 
humanity; of their knowledge, from the design of subduing Persia and 
Chorasan in their way to Jerusalem; of their humanity, from the mas- 
sacre of the Christian people, a friendly city, who came out to meet 
them with palms and crosses in their hands. The arms of Conrad and 
Louis were less cruel and imprudent; but the event of the second cru- 
sade was still more ruinous to Christendom; and the Greek Manuel is 
accused by his own subjects of giving seasonable intelligence to the 
sultan, and treacherous guides to the Latin princes. Instead of crush- 
ing the common foe by a double attack at the same time, but on dif- 
ferent sides, the Germans were urged by emulation, and the French 
were retarded by jealousy. Louis had scarcely passed the Bosphorus 
when he was met by the returning emperor, who had lost the greatest 
part of his army in glorious, but unsuccessful, action, on the banks of the 
Maeander. The contrast of the pomp of his rival hastened the retreat 
of Conrad: the desertion of his independent vassals reduced him to his 
hereditary troops: and he borrowed some Greek vessels to execute by 
sea the pilgrimage of Palestine. Without studying the lessons of ex- 
perience, or the nature of the war, the king of France advanced through 
the same country to a similar fate. The vanguard, which bore the royal 
banner and the oriflamme of St. Denys, 21 had doubled their march with 
rash and inconsiderate speed; and the rear, which the king commanded 
in person, no longer found their companions in the evening camp. In 
darkness and disorder, they were encompassed, assaulted, and over- 
whelmed by the innumerable hosts of Turks, who, in the art of war, 
were superior to the Christians of the twelfth century. Louis, who

*As counts of Vexin, the kings of France were the vassals and advocates 
of the monastery of St Denys. The saint's peculiar banner, which they 
received from the abbot, was of a square form, and ajred or flaming colour. 
The oriflamme appeared at the head of the French armies from the twelfth to 
the fifteenth century (Ducange sur Joinville, dissert, xviii. p. 244-253).

dimbed a tree in the general discomfiture, was saved by his own valour 
and the ignorance of his adversaries; and with the dawn of day he 
escaped alive, but almost alone, to the camp of the vangurd. But in- 
stead of pursuing his expedition by land, he was rejoiced to shelter the 
relics of his army in the friendly seaport of Satalia. From thence he 
embarked for Antioch; but so penurious was the supply of Greek ves- 
sels that they could only afford room for his knights and nobles; and the 
plebeian crowd of infantry was left to perish at the foot of the Pamphyl- 
ian hills. The emperor and the king embraced and wept at Jerusalem; 
their martial trains, the remnant of mighty armies, were joined to the 
Christian powers of Syria, and a fruitless siege of Damascus was the 
final effort of the second crusade. Conrad and Louis embarked for Eu- 
rope with the personal fame of piety and courage; but the Orientals 
had braved these potent monarchs of the Franks, with whose names and 
military forces they had been so often threatened. 22 Perhaps they had 
still more to fear from the veteran genius of Frederic the First, who in 
his youth had served in Asia under his uncle Conrad. Forty campaigns 
in Germany and Italy had taught Barbarossa to command; and his 
soldiers, even the princes of the empire, were accustomed under his 
reign to obey. As soon as he lost sight of Philadelphia and Laodicea, 
the last cities of the Greek frontier, he plunged into the salt and barren 
desert, a land (says the historian) of horror and tribulation. 23 During 
twenty days every step of his fainting and sickly march was besieged 
by the innumerable hordes of Turkmans, 24 whose numbers and fury 
seemed after each defeat to multiply and inflame. The emperor con- 
tinued to struggle and to suffer; and such was the measure of his calami- 
ties, that when he reached the gates of Iconium no more than one thou- 
sand knights were able to serve on horseback. By a sudden and reso- 
lute assault he defeated the guards, and stormed the capital, of the sul- 
tan, 25 who humbly sued for pardon and peace. The road was now open, 
and Frederick advanced in a career of triumph till he was unfortu- 
nately drowned in a petty torrent of Cilicia. 20 The remainder of his

Germans was consumed by sickness and desertion; and the emperor's 
son expired with the greatest part of his Swabian vassals at the siege 
of Acre. Among the Latin heroes Godfrey of Bouillon and Frederic 
Barbarossa could alone achieve the passage of the Lesser Asia; yet even 
their success was a warning; and in the last and most experienced age 
of the crusades every nation preferred the sea to the toils and perils of 
an inland expedition. 27 

The enthusiasm of the first crusade is a natural and simple event, 
while hope was fresh, danger untried, and enterprise congenial to the 
spirit of the times. But the obstinate perseverance of Europe may 
indeed excite our pity and admiration; that no instruction should have 
been drawn from constant and adverse experience: that the same con- 
fidence should have repeatedly grown from the same failures; that six 
succeeding generations should have rushed headlong down the preci- 
pice that was open before them; and that men of every condition should 
have staked their public and private fortunes on the desperate adventure 
of possessing or recovering a tombstone two thousand miles from their 
country. In a period of two centuries after the council of Clermont, 
each spring and summer produced a new emigration of pilgrim warriors 
for the defence of the Holy Land; but the seven great armaments or 
crusades were excited by some impending or recent calamity: the na- 
tions were moved by the authority of their pontiffs and the example of 
their kings: their zeal was kindled, and their reason was silenced, by 
the voice of their holy orators; and among these, Bernard, 38 the monk, 
or the saint, may claim the most honourable place. About eight years 
before the first conquest of Jerusalem he was born of a noble family in 
Burgundy; at the age of three-and-twenty he buried himself in the mon- 
astery of Citeaux, then in the primitive fervour of the institution; at the 
end of two years he led forth her third colony, or daughter, to the valley 
of Clairvaux 20 in Champagne; and was content, till the hour of his 
death, with the humble station of abbot of his own community. A 
philosophic age has abolished, with too liberal and indiscriminate dis- 
dain, the honours of these spiritual heroes. The meanest among them 
are distinguished by some energies of the mind; they were at least

sise per terrain nullatenus est ducenda. He resolves, by the Divine aid, the 
objection, or rather exception, of the first crusade (Secreta Fidelium Crucis,

18 The most authentic information of St. Bernard must be drawn from bis 
own writings, published in a correct edition by Pere Mabillon, and reprinted 
at Venice, 1750, in six volumes in folio. Whatever friendship could recollect, 
or superstition could add, is contained in the two lives, by his disciples, m 
the sixth volume: whatever learning and criticism could ascertain, may be 
found in the prefaces of the Benedictine editor. 

* Clairvaux, surnamed the Valley of Absynth, is situate among the woods 
near Bar sur Aube in Champagne. St Bernard would blush at the pomp of 
the church and monastery; he would ask for the library, and I know not 
whether he would be much edified by a tun of 800 mmds (914 i-7th hogs- 
heads), which almost rivals that of Heidelberg (Melanges tires dune Grande 
Bibliotheque, torn. xlvi. p. 15-20). 



478 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

superior to their votaries and disciples; and, in the race of superstition, 
they attained the prize for which such numbers contended. In speech, 
in writing, in action, Bernard stood high above his rivals and contem- 
poraries; his compositions are not devoid of wit and eloquence; and he 
seems to have preserved as much reason and humanity as may be recon- 
ciled with the character of a saint. In a secular life he would have shared 
the seventh part of a private inheritance; by a vow of poverty and pen- 
ance, by dosing his eyes against the visible world, 30 by the refusal of 
all ecclesiastical dignities, the abbot of Clairvaux became the oracle 
of Europe, and the founder of one hundred and sixty convents. Princes 
and pontiffs trembled at the freedom of his apostolical censures: France, 
England, and Milan consulted and obeyed his judgment in a schism of 
the church: the debt was repaid by the gratitude of Innocent the Sec- 
ond: and his successor, Eugenius the Third, was the friend and disciple 
of the holy Bernard. It was in the proclamation of the second crusade 
ihat he shone as the missionary and prophet of God, who called the 
nations to the defence of his holy sepulchre. 81 At the parliament of 
Vezelay he spoke before the king; and Louis the Seventh, with his 
nobles, received their crosses from his hand. The abbot of Clairvaux 
then marched to the less easy conquest of the emperor Conrad: a phleg- 
matic people, ignorant of his language, was transported by the pathetic 
vehemence of his tone and gestures; and his progress, from Constance 
to Cologne, was the triumph of eloquence and zeal. Bernard applauds 
his own success in the depopulation of Europe; affirms that cities and 
castles were emptied of their inhabitants; and computes that only one 
man was left behind for the consolation of seven widows. 32 The blind 
fanatics were desirous of electing him for taeir general; but the example 
of the hermit Peter was before his eyes; and while he assured the cru- 
saders of the divine favour, he prudently declined a military command, 

80 The disciples of the saint (Vit. ima. L iii. c. 2, p. 1232; Vit. iida. c. 16, 
No. 45, p. 1383) record a marvellous example of his pious apathy. Juxta 
lacum etiam Lausannensem totius diei itinere pergens, penitus non attendit 
aut se videre non vidit Cum enim vespere facto de eodem lacu socii collo- 
"querentur, interrogabat eos ubi lacus ille esset; et mirati sunt universi. 
To admire or despise St. Bernard as he ought, the reader, like myself, should 
have before the windows of his library the beauties of that incomparable 
landscape.

[Bernard had a nobler object in view than merely preaching another cru- 
sade for the defence of the Holy Sepulchre. His design was to arrest the 
fierce and merciless persecution of the Jews which was preparing under the 
monk Radulph, to renew the frightful scenes which had preceded the first 
crusade, in tie flourishing cities on the banks of the Rhine. The Jews have 
always acknowledged the Christian intervention of St. Bernard. 0. S.]

in which failure and victory would have been almost equally disgrace- 
ful to his character. 88 Yet, after the calamitous event, the abbot of 
Clairvaux was loudly accused as a false prophet, the author of the 
public and private mourning; his enemies exulted, his friends blushed, 
and his apology was slow and unsatisfactory. He justifies his obedience 
to the commands of the pope; expatiates on the mysterious ways of 
Providence; imputes the misfortunes of the pilgrims to their own sins; 
and modestly insinuates that his mission had been approved by signs 
and wonders. 8 * Had the fact been certain, the argument would be 
decisive; and his faithful disciples, who enumerate twenty or thirty 
miracles in a day, appeal to the public assemblies of France and Ger- 
many, in which they were performed. 85 At the present hour such prodi- 
gies will not obtain credit beyond the precincts of Clairvaux; but in 
the preternatural cures of the blind, the lame, and the sick, who were 
presented to the man of God, it is impossible for us to ascertain the sep- 
arate shares of accident, of fancy, of imposture, and of fiction. 

.Omnipotence itself cannot escape the murmurs of its discordant vo- 
taries; since the same dispensation which was applauded as a deliverance 
in Europe, was deplored, and perhaps arraigned, as a calamity in Asia. 
After the loss of Jerusalem the Syrian fugitives diffused their conster- 
nation and sorrow: Bagdad mourned in the dust; the cadhi Beineddin 
of Damascus tore his beard in the caliph's presence; and the whole 
divan shed tears at his melancholy tale. 30 But the commanders of the 
faithful could only weep; they were themselves captives in the hands of 
the Turks: some temporal power was restored to the last age of the 
Abbassides; but their humble ambition was confined to Bagdad and the 
adjacent province. Their tyrants, the Seljukian sultans, had followed 
the common law of the Asiatic dynasties, the unceasing round of valour, 
greatness, discord, degeneracy, and decay: their spirit and power were 
unequal to the defence of religion; and, in his distant realm of Persia, 
the Christians were strangers to the name and the arms of Sangiar, the 
last hero of his race. 87 While the sultans were involved in the silken

web of the harem, the pious task was undertaken by their slaves, the 
Atabeks, 88 a Turkish name, which, like the Byzantine patricians, may 
be translated by Father of the Prince. Ascansar, a valiant Turk, had 
been the favourite of Malek Shah, from whom he received the privilege 
of standing on the right hand of the throne; but, in the civil wars that 
ensued on the monarch's death, he lost his head and the government of 
Aleppo. His domestic emirs persevered in their attachment to his son 
Zenghi, who proved his first arms against the Franks in the defeat of 
Antioch: thirty campaigns in the service of the caliph and sultan estab- 
lished his military fame; and he was invested with the command of 
Mosul, as the only champion that could avenge the cause of the prophet. 
The public hope was not disappointed: after a siege of twenty-five days 
he stormed the city of Edessa, and recovered from the Franks their 
conquests beyond the Euphrates: 39 the martial tribes of Curdistan were 
subdued by the independent sovereign of Mosul and Aleppo: his soldiers 
were taught to behold the camp as their only country; they trusted to 
his liberality for their rewards; and their absent families were protected 
by the vigilance of Zenghi. At the head of these veterans his son Nour- 
eddin gradually united the Mohammedan powers, added the kingdom of 
Damascus to that of Aleppo, and waged a long and successful war 
against the Christians of Syria; he spread his ample reign from the 
Tigris to the Nile, and the Abbassides rewarded their faithful servant 
with all the titles and prerogatives of royalty. The Latins themselves 
were compelled to own the wisdom and courage, and even the justice 
and piety, of this implacable adversary. 40 In his life and government 
the holy warrior revived the zeal and simplicity of the first caliphs. 
Gold and silk were banished from his palace, the use of wine from 
his dominions; the public revenue was scrupulously applied to the pub- 
lic service; and the frugal household of Noureddin was maintained 
from his legitimate share of the spoil which he vested in the purchase 
of a private estate. His favourite sultana sighed for some female ob- 

been made prisoner by the Franks, as well as by the Uzes. He reigned near 
fifty years (A.D. 1103-1152), and was a munificent patron of Persian poetry. 
See the Chronology of the Atabeks of Irak and Syria, in De Guignes, torn. 
i. p. 254; and the reigns of Zenghi and Noureddin in the same writer (torn,

39 William of /Tyre (1. xvi. c. 4, 5, 7) describes the loss of Edessa, and the 
death of Zenghi. The corruption of his name into Sanguin afforded the Lat- 
ins a comfortable allusion to his sanguinary character and end, fit sanguine 
sanguinolentus.

may add the primate of the Jacobites (Abulpharag. p. 267), quo non alter

mentis abundaret The true praise of kings is after their death* and from the

ject of expense. " Alas," replied the king, " I fear God, and am no more 
than the treasurer of the Moslems. Their property I cannot alienate; 
but I still possess three shops in the city of Hems: these you may take; 
and these alone can I bestow." His chamber of justice was the terror 
of the great and the refuge of the poor. Some years after the sultan's 
death an oppressed subject called aloud in the streets of Damascus, 
" Noureddin, Noureddin, where art thou now? Arise, arise, to pity 
and protect us! " A tumult was apprehended, and a living tyrant 
blushed or trembled at the name of a departed monarch. 

By the arms of the Turks and Franks the Fatimites had been de- 
prived of Syria. In Egypt the decay of their character and influence 
was still more essential. Yet they were still revered as the descendants 
and successors of the prophet; they maintained their invisible state in 
the palace of Cairo; and their person was seldom violated by the pro- 
fane eyes of subjects or strangers. The Latin ambassadors 41 have de- 
scribed their own introduction through a series of gloomy passages 
and glittering porticoes: the scene was enlivened by the warbling of 
birds and the murmur of fountains: it was enriched by a display of rich 
furniture and. rare animals; of the Imperial treasures, something was 
shown, and much was supposed; and the long order of unfolding doors 
was guarded by black soldiers and domestic eunuchs. The sanc- 
tuary of the presence chamber was veiled with a curtain; and the vizir, 
who conducted the ambassadors, laid aside his scimitar, and prostrated 
himself three times on the ground; the veil was then removed; and they 
beheld the commander of the faithful, who signified his pleasure to the 
first slave of the throne. But this slave was his master: the vizirs or 
sultans had usurped the supreme administration of Egypt; the claims 
of the rival candidates were decided by arms; and the name of the most 
worthy, of the strongest, was inserted in the royal patent of command. 
The factions of Dargham and Shawer alternately expelled each other 
from the capital and country; and the weaker side implored the danger- 
ous protection of the sultan of Damascus, or the king of Jerusalem, the 
perpetual enemies of the sect and monarchy of the Fatimites. By his 
arms and religion the Turk was most formidable; but the Frank, in an 
easy direct march, could advance from Gaza to the Nile; while the in- 
termediate situation of his realm compelled the troops of Noureddin to 
wheel round the skirts of Arabia, a long and painful circuit, which ex- 
posed them to thirst, fatigue, and the burning winds of the desert. The 
secret zeal and ambition of the Turkish prince aspired to reign in Egypt 
under the name of the Abbassides; but the restoration of the suppliant 
Shawer was the ostensible motive of the first expedition; and the suc- 
cess was intrusted to the emir Shiracouh, a valiant and veteran com- 

41 From the ambassador, William of Tyre (1. xix. c. 17, 18) describes the 
palace of Cairo. In the caliph's treasure were found a pearl as large as a 
pigeon's egg, a ruby weighing seventeen Egyptian drachms, an emerald a 
palm and a half in length, and many vases of crystal and porcelain of 
China (Renaudot, p. 536).

mander. Dargham was oppressed and slain; but the ingratitude, the 
jealousy, the just apprehensions, of his more fortunate rival, soon pro- 
voked him to invite the king of Jerusalem to deliver Egypt from his inso- 
lent benefactors. To this union the forces of Shiracouh were unequal: 
he relinquished the premature conquest; and the evacuation of Belbeis 
or Pelusium was the condition of his safe retreat. As the Turks defiled 
before the enemy, and their general dosed the rear, with a vigilant eye, 
and a battle-axe in his hand, a Frank presumed to ask him if he were 
not afraid of an attack? " It is doubtless in your power to begin the 
attack," replied the intrepid emir; "but rest assured that not one of 
my soldiers will go to paradise till he has sent an infidel to hell." His 
report of the riches of the land, the effeminacy of the natives, and the 
disorders of the government, revived the hopes of Noureddin; the caliph 
of Bagdad applauded the pious design; and Shiracouh descended into 
Egypt a second time with twelve thousand Turks and eleven thousand 
Arabs. Yet his forces were still inferior to the confederate armies of the 
Franks and Saracens; and I can discern an unusual degree of military 
urt in his passage of the Nile, his retreat into Thebais, his masterly 
evolutions in the battle of Babain, the surprise of Alexandria, and his 
marches and countermarches in the flats and valley of Egypt, from the 
tropic to the sea. His conduct was seconded by the courage of his 
troops, and on the eve of action a Mamaluke * 2 exclaimed, " If we 
cannot wrest Egypt from the Christian dogs, why do we not renounce 
the honours and rewards of the sultan, and retire to labour with the 
peasants, or to spin with the females of the harem? " Yet, after all 
his efforts in the field, 43 after the obstinate defence of Alexandria 4 * by 
his nephew Saladin, an honourable capitulation and retreat concluded 
the second enterprise of Shiracouh; and Noureddin reserved his abilities 
for a third and more propitious occasion. It was soon offered by the am- 
bition and avarice of Amalric or Amaury, king of Jerusalem, who had 
imbibed the pernicious maxim that no faith should be kept with the 
enemies of God. A religious warrior, the great master of the hospital, 
encouraged Hm to proceed; the emperor of Constantinople either gave, 
or promised, a fleet to act with the armies of Syria; and the perfidious 
Christian, unsatisfied with spoil and subsidy, aspired to the conquest 
of Egypt. In this emergency the Moslems turned their eyes towards 
the sultan of Damascus; the vizir, whom danger encompassed, on all

sides, yielded to their unanimous wishes; and Noureddin seemed to be 
tempted by the fair offer of one third of the revenue of the kingdom. 
The Franks were already at the gates of Cairo; but the suburbs, the 
old city, were burnt on their approach; they were deceived by an insidi- 
ous negotiation, and then- vessels were unable to surmount the barriers 
of the Nile. They prudently declined a contest with the Turks in the 
midst of a hostile country; and Amaury retired into Palestine with the 
shame and reproach that always adhere to unsuccessful injustice. After 
this deliverance, Shiracouh was invested with a robe of honour, which 
he soon stained with the blood of the unfortunate Shawer, For a while 
the Turkish emirs condescended to hold the office of vizir; but this for- 
eign conquest precipitated the fall of the Fatimites themselves; and 
the bloodless change was accomplished by a message and a word. The 
caliphs had been degraded by their own weakness and the tyranny of 
the vizirs: their subjects blushed when the descendant and successor of 
the prophet presented his naked hand to the rude gripe of a Latin am- 
bassador; they wept when he sent the hair of his women, a sad emblem 
of their grief and terror, to excite the pity of the sultan of Damascus. 
By the command of Noureddin, and the sentence of the doctors, the holy 
names of Abubeker, Omar, and Othman were solemnly restored: the 
caliph Mosthadi, of Bagdad, was acknowledged in the pubEc prayers 
as the true commander of the faithful; and the green livery of the sons 
of Ali was exchanged for the black colour of the Abbassides. The last 
of his race, the caliph Adhed, who survived only ten days, expired in 
happy ignorance of his fate: his treasures secured the loyalty of the 
soldiers, and silenced the murmurs of the sectaries; and in all subse- 
quent revolutions Egypt has never departed from the orthodox, tradition 
of the Moslems. 45 

The hilly country beyond the Tigris is occupied by the pastoral tribes 
of the Curds;* 6 a people hardy^ strong, savage, impatient of the yoke, 
addicted to rapine, and tenacious of the government of their national

identify them with the Carduchians of the Greeks;* 7 and they still

descended from the tribe of the Rawadisei, one of the noblest; but as they 
were infected with the heresy of the Metempsychosis, the orthodox sultans

ancestor was a stranger who settled among the Curds.

asserted against the successors of Cyrus. Poverty and ambition 
prompted them to embrace the profession of mercenary soldiers: the 
service 6f his father and uncle prepared the reign of the great Saladin;* 8 
and the son of Job or Ayub, a simple Curd, magnanimously smiled at 
his pedigree, which flattery deduced from the Arabian caliphs.* 8 So 
unconscious was Noureddin of the impending ruin of his house, that 
he constrained the reluctant youth to follow his uncle Shiracouh into 
Egypt: his military character was established by the defence of Alex- 
andria; and if we may believe the Latins, he solicited and obtained from 
the Christian general the profane honours of knighthood. 50 On the 
death of Shiracouh, the office of grand vizir was bestowed on Saladin, 
as the youngest and least powerful of the emirs; but with the advice of 
his father, whom he invited to Cairo, his genius obtained the ascendant 
over his equals, and attached the army to his person and interest. While 
Noureddin lived, these ambitious Curds were the most humble of his 
slaves; and the indiscreet murmurs of the divan were silenced by the 
prudent Ayub who loudly protested that at the command of the Sultan 
he himself would lead his son in chains to the foot of the throne. " Such 
language," he added in private, " was prudent and proper in an assem- 
bly of your rivals; but we are now above fear and obedience; and the 
threats of Noureddin shall not extort the tribute of a sugar-cane." His 
seasonable death relieved them from the odious and doubtful conflict: 
his son, a minor of eleven years of age, was left for a while to the emirs 
of Damascus; and the new lord of Egypt was decorated by the caliph 
with every title 51 that could sanctify his usurpation in the eyes of lie 
people. Nor was Saladin long content with the possession of Egypt: he 
despoiled the Christians of Jerusalem, and the Atabeks of Damascus, 
Aleppo, and Diarbekir: Mecca and Medina acknowledged him for their 
temporal protector: his brother subdued the distant regions of Yemen, 
or the happy Arabia; and at the hour of his death his empire was spread 
from the African Tripoli to the Tigris, and from the Indian Ocean to 
the mountains of Armenia. In the judgment of his character, the re- 
proaches of treason and ingratitude strike forcibly on our minds, im-

pressed, as they are, with the principle and experience of law and 
loyalty. But his ambition may in some measure be excused by the 
revolutions of Asia, 52 which had erased every notion of legitimate suc- 
cession; by the recent example of the Atabeks themselves; by his rever- 
ence to the son of his benefactor; his humane and generous behaviour 
to the collateral branches; by their incapacity and his merit; by 
the approbation of the caliph, the sole source of all legitimate power; 
and, above all, by the wishes and interest of the people, whose hap- 
piness is the first object of government. In his virtues, and in those 
of his patron, they admired the singular union of the hero and the saint; 
for both Noureddin and Saladin are ranked among the Mohammedan 
saints; and the constant meditation of the holy war appears to have 
shed a serious and sober colour over their lives and actions. The youth 
of the latter 53 was addicted to wine and women; but his aspiring spirit 
soon renounced the temptations of pleasure for the graver foUies of 
fame and dominion: the garment of Saladin was a coarse woollen; water 
was his only drink; and, while he emulated the temperance, he surpassed 
the chastity, of his Arabian prophet. Both in faith and practice he was 
a rigid Musulman; he ever deplored that the defence of religion had not 
allowed him to accomplish the pilgrimage of Mecca; but at the stated 
hours, five times each day, the sultan devoutly prayed with his breth- 
ren: the involuntary omission of fasting was scrupulously repaid; and 
his perusal of the Koran, on horseback between the approaching armies, 
may be quoted as a proof, however ostentatious, of piety and courage. 54 
The superstitious doctrine of the sect of Shafei was the only study that 
he deigned to encourage: the poets were safe in his contempt; but all 
profane science was the object of his aversion; and a philosopher who 
had vented some speculative novelties was seized and strangled by the 
command of the royal saint. The justice of his divan was accessible 
to the meanest suppliant against himself aaid his ministers; and it was 
only for a kingdom that Saladin would deviate from the rule of equity. 
While the descendants of Seljuk and Zenghi held his stirrup and 
smoothed his garments, he was affable and patient with the meanest of 
his servants. So boundless was his liberality that he distributed twelve 
thousand horses at the siege of Acre; and at the time of his death no 
more than forty-seven drachms of silver and one piece of gold coin 
were found in the treasury; yet, in a martial reign, the tributes were 
diminished, and the wealthy citizens enjoyed, without fear or danger, 
the fruits of their industry. Egypt, Syria, and Arabia were adorned 
by the royal foundations of hospitals, colleges, and mosques; and Cairo 
was fortified with a wall and citadel; but his works were consecrated to

examples, that the founders of dynasties took the guilt for themselves, and

486 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

public use; 55 nor did the sultan indulge himself in a garden or palace 
of private luxury. In a fanatic age, himself a fanatic, the genuine vir- 
tues of Saladin commanded the esteem of the Christians: the emperor 
of Germany gloried in his friendship; 56 the Greek emperor solicited his 
alliance; 57 and the conquest of Jerusalem diffused, and perhaps magni- 
fied, his fame both in the East and West. 

During its short existence the kingdom of Jerusalem 5S was supported 
by the discord of the Turks and Saracens; and both the Fatimite caliphs 
and the sultans of Damascus were tempted to sacrifice the cause of their 
religion to the meaner considerations of private and present advantage. 
But the powers of Egypt, Syria, and Arabia were now united by a hero 
whom nature and fortune had armed against the Christians. All with- 
out now bore the most threatening aspect; and all was feeble and hollow 
in the internal state of Jerusalem. After the two first Baldwins, the 
brother and cousin of Godfrey of Bouillon, the sceptre devolved by 
female succession to Melisenda, daughter of the second Baldwin, and 
her husband Fulk, count of Anjou, the father, by a former marriage, of 
our English Plantagenets. Their two sons, Baldwin the Third and 
Amaury, waged a strenuous, and not unsuccessful, war against the in- 
fidels; but the son of Amaury, Baldwin the Fourth, was deprived, by 
the leprosy, a gift of the crusades, -of the faculties both of mind and 
body. His sister Sybilla, the mother of Baldwin the Fifth, was his nat- 
ural heiress: after the suspicious death of her child, she crowned her 
second husband, Guy of Lusignan, a prince of a handsome person, but 
of such base renown that his own brother Jeffrey was heard to exclaim, 
" Since they have made him a king, surely they would have made me a 
godl " The choice was generally blamed; and the most powerful vas- 
sal, Raymond count of Tripoli, who had been excluded from the suc- 
cession and regency, entertained an implacable hatred against the king, 
and exposed his honour and conscience to the temptations of the sultan. 
Such were the guardians of the holy city; a leper, a child, a woman, a 
coward, and a traitor: yet its fate was delayed twelve years by some 
supplies from Europe, by the valour of the military orders, and by the 
distant or domestic avocations of their great enemy. At length, on. 
every side, the sinking state was encircled and pressed by a hostile 
line; and the truce was violated by the Franks, whose existence it pro- 
tected. A soldier of fortune, Reginald of Chatillon, had seized a for- 
tress on the edge of the desert, from whence he pillaged the caravans, 
insulted Mohammed, and threatened the cities of Mecca and Medina. 
Saladin condescended to complain; rejoiced in the denial of justice; 

M In many works, particularly Joseph's well in the castle of Cairo, the 
sultan and the patriarch have been confounded by the ignorance of natives 
and travellers.

and at the head of fourscore thousand horse and foot invaded the Holy 
Land. The choice of Tiberias for his first siege was suggested by the 
count of Tripoli, to whom it belonged; and the king of Jerusalem was 
persuaded to drain his garrison, 59 and to arm his people, for the relief 
of that important place. By the advice of the perfidious Raymond 
the Christians were betrayed into a camp destitute of water: he fled on 
the first onset, with the curses of both nations: 00 Lusignan was over- 
thrown, with the loss of thirty thousand men; and the wood of the true 
cross, a dire misfortune 1 was left in the power of the infidels. The 
royal captive was conducted to the tent of Saladin; and as he fainted 
with thirst and terror, the generous victor presented him with a cup of 
sherbet, cooled in snow, without suffering his companion, Reginald of 
Chatillon, to partake of this pledge of hospitality and pardon. " Tho 
person and dignity of a king," said the sultan, " are sacred; but thia 
impious robber must instantly acknowledge the prophet, whom he has 
blasphemed, or meet the death which he has so often deserved." On 
the proud or conscientious refusal of the Christian warrior, Saladin 
struck him on the head with his scimitar, and Reginald was despatched 
by the guards. 61 The trembling Lusignan was sent to Damascus to an 
honourable prison and speedy ransom; but the victory was stained by 
the execution of two hundred and thirty knights of the hospital, the 
intrepid champions and martyrs of their faith. The kingdom was left 
without a head; and of the two grand masters of the military orders, 
the one was slain and the other was a prisoner. From all the cities, 
both of the sea-coast and the inland country, the garrisons had been 
drawn away for this fatal field: Tyre and Tripoli alone could escape 
the rapid inroad of Saladin; and three months after the battle of 
Tiberias he appeared in arms before the gates of Jerusalem. 62

[The number of Saladin's army has been greatly exaggerated. Some 
authorities make it 80,000, others, such as Oman in The Art of War* at 
70,000. But if he had 25,000 men he had as many as he could find a 
commissariat able to support. That was always the chief difficulty in 
Syrian campaigns in the Middle Ages. Cf. Col. MoncriefFs tractate, Com-

a hero m the eyes of the latter.

in his life and death; but the circumstances of the latter are more dis- 
tinctly related by Bohadin and Abulfeda; and Joinville (Hist de St. Louis,

He might expect that the siege of a city so venerable on earth and in 
heaven, so interesting to Europe and Asia, would rekindle the last 
sparks of enthusiasm; and that, of sixty thousand Christians, every man 
would be a soldier, and every soldier a candidate for martyrdom. But 
queen Sybilla trembled for herself and her captive husband; and the 
barons and knights, who had escaped from the sword and chains of the 
Turks, displayed the same factious and selfish spirit in the public ruin. 
The most numerous portion of the inhabitants was composed of the 
Greek and Oriental Christians, whom experience had taught to prefer 
the Mohammedan before the Latin yoke; 03 and the holy sepulchre at- 
tracted a base aid needy crowd, without arms or courage, who sub- 
sisted only on the charity of the pilgrims. Some feeble and hasty efforts 
were made for the defence of Jerusalem: but in the space of fourteen 
days a victorious army drove back the sallies of the besieged, planted 
their engines, opened the wall to the breadth of fifteen cubits, applied 
their scaling-ladders, and erected on the breach twelve banners of the 
prophet and the sultan. It was in vain that a barefoot procession of the 
queen, the women, and the monks, implored the Son of God to save his 
tomb and his inheritance from impious violation. Their sole hope was 
in the mercy of the conqueror, and to the first suppliant deputation that 
mercy was sternly denied. " He had sworn to avenge the patience and 
long-suffering of the Moslems; the hour of forgiveness was elapsed, 
and the moment was now arrived to expiate, in blood, the innocent 
blood which had been spilt by Godfrey and the first crusaders." But 
a desperate and successful struggle of the Franks admonished the sultan 
that his triumph was not yet secure; he listened with reverence to a 
solemn adjuration in the name of the common Father of mankind; and 
a sentiment of human sympathy mollified the rigour of fanaticism and 
conquest; He consented to accept the city and to spare the inhabitants. 
The Greek and Oriental Christians were permitted to live under his do- 
minion; but it was stipulated that in forty days all the Franks and 
Latins should evacuate Jerusalem and be safely conducted to the sea- 
ports of Syria and Egypt; that ten pieces of gold should be paid for 
each man, five for each woman, and one for every child; and that those 
who were unable to purchase their freedom should be detained in per- 
petual, slavery. Of some writers it is a favourite and invidious theme 
to compare the humanity of Saladin with the massacre of the first cru- 
sade. The difference would be merely personal; but we should not for- 
get that the Christians had offered to capitulate, and that the Moham- 
medans of Jerusalem sustained the last extremities of an assault and 
storm. Justice is indeed due to the fidelity with which the Turkish con- 
queror fulfilled the conditions of the treaty; and he may be deservedly 
praised for the glance of pity which he cast on the misery of the van- 
quished. Instead of a rigorous exaction of his debt, he accepted a sum

of thirty thousand byzants for the ransom of seven thousand poor; two 
or three thousand more were dismissed by his gratuitous clemency; and 
the number of slaves was reduced to eleven or fourteen thousand per- 
sons. In his interview with the queen, his words, and even his tears, 
suggested the kindest consolations: his liberal alms were distributed 
among those who had been made orphans or widows by the fortune of 
war; and while the knights of the hospital were in arms against him, 
he allowed their more pious brethren to continue, during the term of a 
year, the care and service of the sick. In these acts of mercy the virtue 
of Saladin deserves our admiration and love: he was above the neces- 
sity of dissimulation, and his stern fanaticism would have prompted 
him to dissemble, rather than to affect, this profane compassion for the 
enemies of the Koran. After Jerusalem had been delivered from the 
presence of the strangers, the sultan made his triumphant entry, his ban- 
ners waving in the wind, and to the harmony of martial music. The 
great mosque of Omar, which had been converted into a church, was 
again consecrated to one God and his prophet Mohammed: the walls 
and pavement were purified with rose-water; and a pulpit, the labour of 
Noureddin, was erected in the sanctuary. But when the golden crosa- 
that glittered on the dome was cast down and dragged through the- 
streets, the Christians of every sect uttered a lamentable groan, which 
was answered by the joyful shouts of the Moslems. In four ivory 
chests the patriarch had collected the crosses, the images, the vases v 
and the relics of the holy place; they were seized by the conqueror r 
who was desirous of presenting the caliph with the trophies of Christian 
idolatry. He was persuaded, however, to intrust them to the patriarch- 
and prince of Antioch; and the pious pledge was redeemed by Richard 
of England, at the expense of fifty-two thousand byzants of gold. 04 

The nations might fear and hope the immediate and final expulsion of 
the Latins from Syria, which was yet delayed above a century after the 
death of Saladin. 65 In the career of victory he was first checked by the 
resistance of Tyre; the troops and garrisons, which had capitulated r 
were imprudently conducted to the same port: their numbers were ade- 
quate to the defence of the place; and the arrival of Conrad of Mont- 
ferrat inspired the disorderly crowd with confidence and union. His 
father, a venerable pilgrim, had been made prisoner in the battle of 
Tiberias; but that disaster was unknown in Italy and Greece, when the 
son was urged by ambition and piety to visit the inheritance of his 
royal nephew, the infant Baldwin. The view of the Turkish banners 
warned him from the hostile coast of Jaffa; and Conrad was unani-

mously hailed as the prince and champion of Tyre, which was already 
besieged by the conqueror of Jerusalem. The firmness of his zeal, and 
perhaps his knowledge of a generous foe, enabled him to brave the 
threats of the sultan, and to declare that, should his aged parent be 
exposed before the walls, he himself would discharge the first arrow, 
and glory in his descent from a Christian martyr. 60 The Egyptian fleet 
was allowed to enter the harbour of Tyre; but the chain was suddenly 
drawn, and five -galleys were either sunk or taken: a thousand Turks 
were slain in a sally; and Saladin, after burning his engines, concluded 
a glorious campaign by a disgraceful retreat to Damascus. He was soon 
assailed by a more formidable tempest. The pathetic narratives, and 
even the pictures, that represented in lively colours the servitude and 
profanation of Jerusalem, awakened the torpid sensibility of Europe: 
the emperor Frederic Barbarossa, and the kings of France and Eng- 
land, assumed the cross; and the tardy magnitude of their armaments 
was anticipated by the maritime states of the Mediterranean and the 
Ocean. The skilful and provident Italians first embarked in the ships 
of Genoa, Pisa, and Venice. They were speedily followed by the most 
eager pilgrims of France, Normandy,, and the Western Isles. The pow- 
erful succour -of Flanders, Frise, and Denmark filled near a hundred 
vessels- -and the Northern warriors were distinguished -in the field by 
a lofty stature and a ponderous battle-axe. 67 Their increasing multi- 
tudes could no longer be confined within the walls of Tyre, or remain 
obedient to the voice of Conrad. They pitied the misfortunes and 
revered the dignity of Lusignan, who was released from prison, perhaps 
to divide the army of the Franks: He proposed the recovery of Ptole- 
mais, or Acre, thirty miles to the south of Tyre; and the place was first 
invested by two thousand horse and thirty thousand foot under his 
nominal command. I shall not expatiate on the story of this memo- 
rable siege, which lasted near two years, and consumed, in a narrow 
space, the forces of Europe and Asia. Never did the flame of enthusi- 
asm burn with fiercer and more destructive rage; nor could the true 
believers, a common appellation, who consecrated their own martyrs, 
refuse some applause to the mistaker* zeal and courage of their adver- 
saries.. At the spund of the holy trumpet the Moslems of Egypt, Syria, 
Arabia, and the Oriental provinces assembled under the servant of the 
prophet; 68 his camp was pitched and removed within a few miles of 
Acre; and he laboured night and day for the relief of his brethren *ind 
the annoyance of the Franks. Nine battles, not unworthy of the name,

were fought in the neighbourhood of Mount Carmel, with such vicissi- 
tude of fortune, that in one attack the sultan forced his way into the 
city; that in one sally the Christians penetrated to the royal tent. By 
the means of divers and pigeons a regular correspondence was main- 
tained with the besieged; and, as often as the sea was left open, the 
exhausted garrison was withdrawn, and a fresh supply was poured into 
the place. The Latin camp was thinned by famine, the sword, and the 
climate; but the tents of the dead were replenished with new pilgrims, 
who exaggerated the strength and speed of their approaching country- 
men. The vulgar was astonished by the report that the pope himself, 
with an innumerable crusade, was advanced as far as Constantinople. 
The march of the emperor filled the East with more serious alarms: the 
obstacles which he encountered in Asia, and perhaps in Greece, were 
raised by the policy of Saladin: his joy on the death of Barbarossa was 
measured by his esteem; and the Christians were rather dismayed than 
encouraged at the sight of the duke of Swabia and his way-worn rem- 
nant of five thousand Germans. At length, in the spring of the second 
year, the royal fleets of France and England cast anchor in the bay of 
Acre, and the siege was more vigorously prosecuted by the youthful 
emulation of the two kings, Philip Augustus and Richard Plantagenet 
After every resource had been tried, and every hope was exhausted, the 
defenders of Acre submitted to their fate; a capitulation was granted, 
but their lives and liberties were taxed at the hard conditions of a 
ransom of two hundred thousand pieces of gold, the deliverance of one 
hundred nobles and fifteen hundred inferior captives, and the restoration 
of the wood of the holy cross. Some doubts in the agreement, and some 
delay in the execution, rekindled the fury of the Franks, and three thou- 
sand Moslems, almost in the sultan's view, were beheaded by the com- 
mand of the sanguinary Richard. 69 By the conquest of Acre the Latin 
powers acquired a strong town and a convenient harbour; but the advan- 
tage was most dearly purchased. The minister and historian of Saladin 
computes, from the report of the enemy, that their numbers, at different 
periods, amounted to five or six hundred thousand; that more than one 
hundred thousand Christians were slain; that a far greater number was 
lost by disease or shipwreck; and that a small portion of this mighty 
host could return in safety to their native countries. 70

492 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

Philip Augustus and Richard the First are the only kings of France 
and England who have fought under the same banners; but the holy 
service in which they were enlisted was incessantly disturbed by their 
national jealousy; and the two factions which they protected in Pales- 
tine were more averse to each other than to the common enemy. In 
the eyes of the Orientals the French monarch was superior in dignity 
and power; and, in the emperor's absence, the Latins revered him as 
their temporal chief. 71 His exploits were not adequate to his fame. 
Philip was brave, but the statesman predominated in his character; he 
was soon weary of sacrificing his health and interest on a barren coast: 
the surrender of Acre became tike signal of his departure; nor could 
he justify this unpopular desertion by leaving the duke of Burgundy, 
with five hundred knights and ten thousand foot, for the service of the 
Holy Land. The king of England, though inferior in dignity, surpassed 
his rival in wealth and military renown; 72 and if heroism be confined to 
brutal and ferocious valour, Richard Plantagenet will stand high among 
the heroes of the age. The memory of Ccsur de Lwn y of the lion-hearted 
prince, was long dear and glorious to his English subjects; and at the 
distance of sixty years it was celebrated in proverbial sayings by the 
grandsons of the Turks and Saracens against whom he had fought: his 
tremendous name was employed by the Syrian mothers to silence their 
infants; and if a horse suddenly started from the way, his rider was 
wont to exclaim, " Dost thou think king Richard is in that bush? " TS 
His cruelty to the Mohammedans was the effect of temper and zeal; 
but I cannot believe that a soldier, so free and fearless in .the use of his 
lance, would have descended to whet a dagger against his valiant brother 
Conrad of Montferrat, who was slain at Tyre by some secret assassins. 74 
After the surrender of Acre, and the departure of Philip, the king of 
England led the crusaders to the recovery of the sea-coast; and the 
cities of Caesarea and Jaffa were added to the fragments of the kingdom 
of Lusignan. A march of one hundred miles from Acre to Ascalon was 
a great and perpetual battle of eleven days. In the disorder of his 
troops, Saladin remained on the field with seventeen guards, without

lawless and -wasteful oppression they were collected.

fession of the assassins that they were sent by the king of England (Bo- 
hadin, p. 225 [P. ii. c. 144]) ; and his only defence is an absurd and palpable 
forgery (Hist, de I'Acad&amp;nie des Inscriptions, torn. xvL p. 155-163), a pre- 
tended letter from the prince of the assassins, the Sheich, or old man of the 
mountain, who justified Richard, by assuming to himself the guilt or merit 
of the murder.

lowering his standard, or suspending the sound of his brazen kettle- 
drum: he again rallied and renewed the charge; and his preachers or 
heralds called aloud on the Unitarians manfully to stand up against the 
Christian idolaters. But the progress of these idolaters was irresistible; 
and it was only by demolishing the walls and buildings of Ascalon that 
the sultan could prevent them from occupying an important fortress on 
the confines of Egypt. During a severe winter the armies slept; but in 
the spring the Franks advanced within a day's march of Jerusalem, 
under the leading standard of the English king; and his active spirit 
intercepted a convoy, or caravan, of seven thousand camels. Saladin 75 
had fixed his station in the holy city; but the city was struck with con- 
sternation and discord: he fasted; he prayed; he preached; he offered 
to share the dangers of the siege; but his Mamalukes, who remembered 
the fate of their companions at Acre, pressed the sultan, with loyal or 
seditious clamours, to reserve his person and their courage for the future 
defence of the religion and empire. 76 The Moslems were delivered by 
the sudden, or, as they deemed, the miraculous, retreat of the Chris- 
tians; 77 and the laurels of Richard were blasted by the prudence, or 
envy, of his companions. The hero, ascending a hill, and veiling his 
face, exclaimed with an indignant voice, " Those who are unwilling to 
rescue, are unworthy to view, the sepulchre of Christ! " After his 
return to Acre, on the news that Jaffa was surprised by the sultan, he 
sailed with some merchant vessels, and leaped foremost on the beach: 
the castle was relieved by his presence; and sixty thousand Turks and 
Saracens fled before his arms. The discovery of his weakness provoked 
them to return in the morning; and they found him carelessly encamped 
before the gates with only seventeen knights and three hundred archers. 
Without counting their numbers, he sustained their charge; and we 
learn from the evidence of his enemies that the king of England, grasp- 
ing his lance, rode furiously along their front, from the right to the 
left wing, without meeting an adversary who dared to encounter his 
career. 78 Am I writing the history of Orlando or AmacHs? 

75 See the distress and pious firmness of Saladin, as they are described by 
Bohadin (p. 7-9, 235-237), who himself harangued the defenders of Jeru- 
salem; their fears were not unknown to the enemy (Jacob, a Vitriacb, L i. 
c, zoo, p. 1123; Vinisauf, L v. c. 50. p. 399) 

"Yet, unless the sultan, or an Ayoubite prince, remained in Jerusalem, 
nee Curdi Turcis, nee Turci essent obtemperaturi Curdis (Bohadin, p. 236 
[P. ii. c. 156]). He draws aside a corner of the political curtain. 

"Bohadin (p. 237), and even Jeffrey de Vinisauf (1. vi. c. 1-8, p. 403-409), 
ascribe the retreat to Richard himself; and Jacobus a Vitriaco observes 
that, in his impatience to depart, in alterum virum mutatus est (p. 1123). 
Yet Joinville, a French knight, accuses the envy of Hugh duke of Bur- 
gundy (p. 116), without supposing, like Matthew Paris, that he was bribed 
by Saladin. 

w The expeditions to Ascalon, Jerusalem, and Jaffa, are related by Bohadin. 
(p. 184-249) and Abulfeda (p. 51, 52). The author of the Itinerary, or 
the monk of St. Alban's, cannot exaggerate the cadhTs account of th* 
prowess of Richard (Vinisauf, 1. vi. c. 14-24, p, 412-421; Hist. Major- 
p. 137-143) ; and on the whole of this war there is a marvellous agreement 



494 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

- During these hostilities a languid and tedious negotiation 79 between 
the Franks and Moslems was started, and continued, and broken, and 
again resumed, and again broken. Some acts of royal courtesy, the gift 
of snow and fruit, the exchange of Norway hawks and Arabian horses, 
softened the asperity of religious war; from the vicissitude of success 
the monarchs might learn to suspect that Heaven was neuter in the 
quarrel: nor, after the trial of each other, could either hope for a de- 
cisive victory. 80 The health both of Richard and Saladin appeared to 
be in a declining state; and they respectively suffered the evils of distant 
and domestic warfare: Plantagenet was impatient to punish a perfidi- 
ous rival who had invaded Normandy in his absence; and the inde- 
fatigable sultan was subdued by the cries of the people, who was the 
victim, and of the soldiers, who were the instruments, of his martial 
zeal. The first demands of the king of England were the restitution of 
Jerusalem, Palestine, and the true cross; and he firmly declared that 
himself and his brother pilgrims would end their lives in the pious 
labour, rather than return to Europe with ignominy and remorse. But 
ie conscience of Saladin refused, without some weighty compensation, 
to restore the idols, or promote the idolatry, of the Christians: he as- 
serted, with equal firmness, his religious and civil claim to the sover- 
eignty of Palestine; descanted on the importance and sanctity of Jeru- 
salem; and rejected all terms of the establishment, or partition, of the 
Latins. The marriage which Richard proposed, of his sister with the 
sultan's brother, was defeated by the difference of faith: the princess ab- 
horred the embraces of a Turk; and Adel, or Saphadin, would not easily 
renounce a plurality of wives. A personal interview was declined by 
Saladm, who alleged their mutual ignorance of each other's language; 
and the negotiation was managed with much art and delay by their 
Interpreters and envoys. The final agreement was equally disapproved 
by the zealots of both parties, by the Roman pontiff and the caliph of 
Bagdad. It was stipulated that Jerusalem and the holy sepulchre 
should be open, without tribute or vexation, to the pilgrimage of the 
Latin Christians; that, after the demolition of Ascalon, they should in- 
clusively possess the sea-coast from Jaffa to Tyre; that lie count of 
Tripoli and the prince of Antioch should be comprised in the truce; 
and that, during ^three years and three months, all hostilities should 
cease. The principal chiefs of the two armies swore to the observance 

between, the Christian and Mohammedan writers, who mutually praise the 
virtues of their -enemies.

returning with new armies to the conquest of the Holy Land; and Saladin

Vimsiatif, Ifanerarium Regis Anglorum Richardi et aliorum in Terrain

Scnptores Hist Anglicanse (p. 247-429). Roger Hoveden and Matthew

of the treaty; but the monarchs were satisfied with giving their word 
and their right hand; and the royal majesty was excused from an oath, 
which always implies some suspicion of falsehood and dishonour. Rich- 
ard embarked for Europe, to seek a long captivity and a premature 
grave; and the space of a few months concluded the life and glories ol 
Saladin. The Orientals described his edifying death, which happened 
at Damascus; but they seem ignorant of the equal distribution of his 
alms among the three religions, 81 or of the display of a shroud, instead 
of a standard, to admonish the East of the instability of human great- 
ness. The unity of empire was dissolved by his death; his sons were 
oppressed by the stronger arm of their uncle Saphadin; the hostile in- 
terests of the sultans of Egypt, Damascus, and Aleppo 82 were again 
revived; and the Franks or Latins stood, and breathed, and hoped, in 
their fortresses along the Syrian coast. 

The noblest monument of a conqueror's fame, and of the terror which 
he inspired, is the Saladine tenth, a general tax, which was imposed on 
the laity and even the clergy of the Latin church for the service of the 
holy war. The practice was too lucrative to expire with the occasion; 
and this tribute became the foundation of all the tithes and tenths on 
ecclesiastical benefices which have been granted by the Roman pontiffs 
to Catholic sovereigns, or reserved for the immediate use of the apos- 
tolic see. 83 This pecuniary emolument must have tended to increase 
the interest of the popes in the recovery of Palestine: after the death of 
Saladin they preached the crusade by their epistles, their legates, and 
their missionaries; and the accomplishment of the pious work might 
have been expected from the zeal and talents of Innocent the Third. 84 
Under that young and ambitious priest the successors of St. Peter at- 
tained the full meridian of their greatness: and in a reign of eighteen 
years he exercised a despotic command over the emperors and tings, 
whom he raised and deposed; over the nations, whom an interdict of 
months or years deprived, for the offence of their rulers, of the exercise 
of Christian worship. In the council of the Laterari he acted as the 
ecclesiastical, almost as the temporal, sovereign of the East and West. 
It was at the feet of his legate that John of England surrendered his 
crown; and Innocent may boast of the two most signal triumphs over 
sense and humanity, the establishment of transubstantiation and the 
origin of the inquisition. At his voice two crusades, the fourth and

the fifth, were undertaken; but, except a king of Hungary, the princes 
of the second order were at the head of the pilgrims; the forces were 
inadequate to the design, nor did the effects correspond with the hopes 
and wishes of the pope and the people. The fourth crusade was di- 
verted from Syria, to Constantinople; and the conquest of the Greek 
or Roman empire by the Latins will form the proper and important sub- 
ject of the next chapter. In the fifth, 85 two hundred thousand Franks 
were landed at the eastern mouth of the Nile. They reasonably hoped 
that Palestine must be subdued in Egypt, the seat and storehouse of the 
sultan; and after a siege of sixteen months the Moslems deplored the loss 
of Damietta. But the Christian army was ruined by the pride and inso- 
lence of the legate Pelagius, who, in the pope's name, assumed the char- 
acter of general; the sickly Franks were encompassed by the waters of 
the Nile and the Oriental forces; and it was by the evacuation of Dami- 
etta that they obtained a safe retreat, some concessions for the pilgrims, 
and the tardy restitution of the doubtful relic of the true cross. The 
failure may in some measure be ascribed to the abuse and multiplication 
of the crusades, which were preached at the same time against the 
pagans of Livonia, the Moors of Spain, the Albigeois of France, and the 
kings of Sicily of the Imperial family. 86 In these meritorious services 
the volunteers might acquire at home the same spiritual indulgence and 
a larger measure of temporal rewards; and even the popes, in their zeal 
against a domestic enemy, were sometimes tempted to forget the dis- 
tress of their Syrian brethren. From the last age of the crusades they 
derived the occasional command of an army and revenue, and some 
deep reasoners have suspected that the whole enterprise, from the first 
synod of Placentia, was contrived and executed by the policy of Rome. 
The suspicion is not founded either in nature or in fact. The successors 
of St. Peter appear to have followed, rather than guided, the impulse of 
manners and prejudice; without much foresight of the seasons or culti- 
vation of the soil, they gathered the ripe and spontaneous fruits of the 
superstition of the times. They gathered these fruits without toil or 
personal danger: in the council of the Lateran, Innocent the Third de- 
clared an ambiguous resolution of animating the crusaders by his ex- 
ample; but the pilot of the sacred vessel could not abandon the helm, 
nor was Palestine ever blessed with the presence of a Roman pontiff. 87

The persons, the families, and estates of the pilgrims were under the 
immediate protection of the popes; and these spiritual patrons soon 
claimed the prerogative of directing their operations, and enforcing, 
by commands and censures, the accomplishment of their vow. Frederic 
the Second, 88 the grandson of Barbarossa, was successively the pupil, 
the enemy, and the victim of the church. At the age of twenty-one 
years, and in obedience to his guardian Innocent the Third, he assumed 
the cross; the same promise was repeated at his royal and imperial cor- 
onations, and his marriage with the heiress of Jerusalem for ever bound 
him to defend the kingdom of his son Conrad. But as Frederic advanced 
in age and authority, he repented of the rash engagements of his youth: 
his liberal sense and knowledge taught him to despise the phantoms of 
superstition and the crowns of Asia; he no longer entertained the same 
reverence for the successors of Innocent; and his ambition was occupied 
by the restoration of the Italian monarchy from Sicily to the Alps. 
But the success of this project would have reduced the popes to their 
primitive simplicity, and, after the delays and excuses of twelve years, 
they urged the emperor, with entreaties and threats, to fix the time and 
place of his departure for Palestine. In the harbours of Sicily and 
Apulia he prepared a fleet of one hundred galleys, and of one hundred 
vessels, that were framed to transport and land two thousand five hun- 
dred knights, with their horses and attendants; his vassals of Naples 
and Germany formed a powerful army, and the number of English cru- 
saders was magnified to sixty thousand by the report of fame. But 
the inevitable or affected slowness of these mighty preparations con- 
sumed the strength and provisions of the more indigent pilgrims; the 
multitude was thinned by sickness and desertion, and the sultry summer 
of Calabria anticipated the mischiefs of a Syrian campaign. At length 
the emperor hoisted sail at Brundusium, with a fleet and army of forty 
thousand men; but he kept the sea no more than three days, and his 
hasty retreat, which was ascribed by his friends to a grievous indisposi- 
tion, was accused by his enemies as a voluntary and obstinate disobedi- 
ence. For suspending his vow was Frederic excommunicated by Greg- 
ory the Ninth; for presuming, the next year, to accomplish his vow, he 
was again excommunicated by the same pope. 89 While he served under 
the banner of the cross a crusade was preached against him in Italy; 
and after his return he was compelled to ask pardon for the injuries 
which he had suffered. The clergy and military orders of Palestine

were previously instructed to renounce his communion and dispute his 
commands, and in his own kingdom the emperor was forced to consent 
that the orders of the camp should be issued in the name of God and 
of the Christian republic, Frederic entered Jerusalem in triumph, and 
with his own hands (for no priest would perform the office) he took the 
crown from the altar of the holy sepulchre. But the patriarch cast an 
interdict on the church which his presence had profaned; and the 
knights of the hospital and temple informed the sultan how easily he 
might be surprised and slain in his unguarded visit to the river Jordan. 
In such a state of fanaticism and faction, victory was hopeless and 
defence was difficult; but the conclusion of an advantageous peace may 
be imputed to the discord of the Mohammedans, and their personal 
esteem for the character of Frederic. The enemy of the church is 
accused of maintaining with the miscreants an intercourse of hospitality 
and friendship unworthy of a Christian; of despising the barrenness of 
the land; -and of indulging a profane thought that if Jehovah had seen 
the kingdom of Naples, he never would have selected Palestine for the 
inheritance of his chosen people. Yet Frederic obtained from the sul- 
tan the restitution of Jerusalem, of Bethlehem and Nazareth, of Tyre 
and Sidon; the Latins were allowed to inhabit and fortify the city; an 
equal code of civil and religious freedom was ratified for the sectaries of 
Jesus and those of Mohammed; and while the former worshipped at 
the holy sepulchre, the latter might pray and preach in the mosque of 
the temple 90 from whence the prophet undertook his nocturnal journey 
to heaven. The clergy deplored this scandalous toleration, and the 
weaker Moslems were gradually expelled; but every rational object of 
the crusades was accomplished without bloodshed; the churches were 
restored, the monasteries were replenished, and, in the space of fifteen 
years, the Latins of Jerusalem exceeded the number of six thousand. 
Th?s peace and prosperity, for which they were ungrateful to their bene- 
factor, was terminated by the irruption of the strange and savage hordes 
of Carizmians. 01 Flying from the arms of the Moguls, those shepherds 
of the Caspian rolled headlong on Syria; and the union of the Franks 
with the sultans of Aleppo, Hems, and Damascus was insufficient to 
stem the. violence of the torrent. Whatever stood against them was cut 
off by the sword or -dragged into captivity; the military orders were 
almost exterminated in a single battle; and in the pillage of the city, 
in the profanation of the holy sepulchre, the Latins confess and regret 
the modesty and discipline of the Turks and Saracens. 

Of the seven crusades, the two last were undertaken by Louis the 
Ninth, king of France, who lost his liberty in Egypt, and his life on

the coast of Africa, Twenty-eight years after his death he was canon- 
ised at Rome, and sixty-five miracles were readily found and solemnly 
attested to justify the claim of the royal saint. 82 The voice of history 
renders a more honourable testimony, that he united the virtues of a 
king, a hero, and a man; that his martial spirit was tempered by the 
love of private and public justice; and that Louis was the father of his 
people, the friend of his neighbours, and the terror of the infidels. Super- 
stition alone, in all the extent of her baleful influence, 83 corrupted his 
understanding and his heart; his devotion stooped to admire and imi- 
tate the begging friars of Francis and Dominic; he pursued with blind 
and cruel zeal the enemies of the faith; and the best of kings twice 
descended from his throne to seek the adventures of a spiritual knight- 
errant. A monkish historian would have been content to applaud the 
most despicable part of his character; but the noble and gallant Join- 
ville, 94 who shared the friendship and captivity of Louis, has traced 
with the pencil of nature the free portrait of his virtues as well as of 
his failings. From this intimate knowledge we may learn to suspect 
the political views of depressing their great vassals, which are so often 
imputed to the royal authors of the crusades. Above all the princes of 
the middle ages Louis the Ninth successfully laboured to restore the 
prerogatives of the crown; but it was at home, and not in the East, 
that he acquired for himself and his posterity; his vow was the result of 
enthusiasm and sickness; and if he were the promoter, he was likewise 
the victim, of this holy madness. For the invasion of Egypt, France 
was exhausted of her troops and treasures; he covered the sea of Cyprus 
with eighteen hundred sails; the most modest enumeration amounts to 
fifty thousand men; and, if we might trust his own confession, as it is 
reported by Oriental vanity, he disembarked nine thousand five hun- 
dred horse, and one hundred and thirty thousand foot, who performed

In complete armour, the oriflamme waving before him, Louis leaped

almost on the same ground, were productive of similar calamities. 96 
After a ruinous delay, which introduced into the camp the seeds of an 
epidemical disease, the Franks advanced from the sea-coast towards 
the capital of Egypt, and strove to surmount the unseasonable inunda- 
tion of the Nile which opposed their progress. Under the eye of their 
intrepid monarch, the barons and knights of France displayed their 
invincible contempt of danger and discipline; his brother, the count of 
Artois, stormed with inconsiderate valour the town of Massoura; and 
the carrier pigeons announced to the inhabitants of Cairo that all was 
lost. But a soldier, who afterwards usurped the sceptre, rallied the 
.flying troops: the main body of the Christians was far behind their 
vanguard, and Artois was overpowered and slain. A shower of Greek 
jfire was incessantly poured on the invaders; the Nile was commanded 
by the Egyptian galleys, the open country by the Arabs; all provisions 
-were intercepted; each day aggravated the sickness and famine; and 
about the same time a retreat was found to be necessary and imprac- 
ticable. The Oriental writers confess that Louis might have escaped 
if he would have deserted his subjects: he was made prisoner, with the 
greatest part of his nobles; all who could not redeem their lives by 
service or ransom were inhumanly massacred, and the walls of Cairo 
were decorated with a circle of Christian heads. 87 The king of France 
was loaded with chains, but the generous victor, a great-grandson of 
the brother of Saladin, sent a robe of honour to his royal captive, and 
his deliverance, with that of his soldiers, was obtained by the restitution 
of Damietta 9S and the payment of four hundred thousand pieces of gold. 
In a soft and luxurious climate the degenerate children of the com- 
panions of Noureddin and Saladin were incapable of resisting the 
flower of European chivalry; they triumphed by the arms of their slaves 
or Mamalukes, the hardy natives of Tartary, who at a tender age had 
been purchased of the Syrian merchants, and were educated in the camp 
and palace of the sultan. But Egypt soon afforded a new example of 
the danger of praetorian bands; and the rage of these ferocious animals, 
who had been let loose on the strangers, was provoked to devour their 
benefactor. In the pride of conquest, Touran Shah, the last of his 
/ace, was murdered by his Mamalukes; and the most daring of the

98 For the ransom of St^ Louis a million of byzants was asked and granted ; 
but the sultan's generosity reduced that sum to 800,000 byzants, which 
are valued by Joinville at 400,000 French livres of his own time, and ex- 
pressed by Matthew Paris by 100,000 marks of silver (Ducange, Disserta- 
tion xx. sur Joinville).

assassins entered the chamber of the captive king, with drawn scimitars, 
and their hands imbrued in the blood of their sultan. The firmness 
of Louis commanded their respect; 00 their avarice prevailed over cruelty 
and zeal, the treaty was accomplished, and the king of France, with the 
relics of his army, was permitted to embark for Palestine. He wasted 
four years within the walls of Acre, unable to visit Jerusalem, and 
unwilling to return without glory to his native country. 

The memory of his defeat excited Louis, after sixteen years of wis- - 
dom and repose, to undertake the seventh and last of the crusades. His 
finances were restored, his kingdom was enlarged; a new generation of 
warriors had arisen, and he embarked with fresh confidence at the head 
of six thousand horse and thirty thousand foot. The loss of Antioch 
had provoked the enterprise; a wild hope of baptising the king of Tuni? 
tempted him to steer for the African coast; and the report of an im^ 
mense treasure reconciled his troops to the delay of their voyage to the 
Holy Land. Instead of a proselyte, he found a siege; the French panted 
and died on the burning sands; St. Louis expired in his tent; and no 
sooner had he closed his eyes than his son and successor gave lie signal 
of the retreat. 100 " It is thus," says a lively writer, " that a Christian 
king died near the ruins of Carthage, waging war against the sectaries 
of Mohammed, in a land to which Dido had introduced the deities of 
Syria." 101 

A more unjust and absurd constitution cannot be devised than that 
which condemns the natives of a country to perpetual servitude under 
the arbitrary dominion of strangers and slaves. Yet such has been the 
state of Egypt above five hundred years. The most illustrious sultans 
of the Baharite and Borgite dynasties 102 were themselves promoted from 
the Tartar and Circassian bands; and the four-and-twenty beys, or mili- 
tary chiefs, have ever been succeeded, not by their sons, but by their 
servants. They produce the great charter of their liberties, the treaty 
of Selim the First with the republic; 103 and the Othman emperor still

tested by Joinville (p. 77, 78), and does not appear to me so absurd as to

themselves were strangers, rebels, and equals: they had felt his valour, 
they hoped his conversion; and such a motion, which was not seconded, 
might be made perhaps by a secret Christian in their tumultuous assembly.

accepts .from Egypt a slight acknowledgment of tribute and subjection. 
With some breathing intervals of peace and order, the two dynasties are 
marked as a period of rapine and bloodshed; 104 but their throne, how- 
ever shaken, reposed on the two pillars of discipline and^ valour; their 
sway extended over Egypt, Nubia, Arabia, and Syria; their Mamalukes 
were multiplied from eight hundred to twenty-five thousand horse; and 
their numbers were increased by a provincial militia of one hundred and 
seven thousand foot, and the occasional aid of sixty-six thousand 
Arabs. 105 Princes of such power and spirit could not long endure on 
their coast a hostile and independent nation; and if the ruin of the 
Franks was postponed about forty years, they were indebted to the cares 
of an unsettled reign, to the invasion of the Mogols, and to the occa- 
sional aid of some warlike pilgrims. Among these the English reader 
will observe the name of our first Edward, who assumed the cross in the 
lifetime of his father Henry. At the head of a thousand soldiers the 
future conqueror of Wales and Scotland delivered Acre from a siege; 
marched as far as Nazareth with an army of nine thousand men; emu- 
lated the fame of his uncle Richard; extorted, by his valour, a ten years' 
truce; and escaped, with a dangerous wound, from the dagger of a 
fanatic assassin.* Antioch, 107 whose situation had been less exposed 
to the calamities of the holy war, was finally occupied and ruined by 
Bondocdar, or Bibars, sultan of Egypt and Syria; the Latin principality 
was extinguished; and the first seat of the Christian name was dis- 
peopled fay the slaughter of seventeen, and the captivity of one hundred, 
thousand of her inhabitants. The maritime towns of Laodicea, Gabala, 
Tripoli, Berytus, Sidon, Tyre, and Jaffa, and the stronger castles of the 
Hospitalers and Templars, successively fell; and the whole existence of 
the Franks was confined to the city and colony of St. John of Acre, 
which is sometimes described by the more classic title of Ptolemais.

miles, became the metropolis of the Latin Christians, and was adorned

with strong and stately buildings, with aqueducts, an artificial port, 
and a double wall. The population was increased by the incessant 
streams of pilgrims and fugitives; in the pauses of hostility the trade 
of the East and West was attracted to this convenient station, and the 
market could offer the produce of every clime and the interpreters of 
every tongue. But in this conflux of nations every vice was propagated 
and practised; of all the disciples of Jesus and Mohammed, the male 
and female inhabitants of Acre were esteemed the most corrupt, nor 
could the abuse of religion be corrected by the discipline of law. The 
city had many sovereigns and no government. The kings of Jerusalem 
and Cyprus, of the house of Lusignan, the princes of Antioch, the counts 
of Tripoli and Sidon, the great masters of the hospital, the temple, and 
the Teutonic order, the republics of Venice, Genoa, and Pisa, the pope's 
legate, the kings of France and England, assumed an independent com- 
mand; seventeen tribunals exercised the power of life and death; every 
criminal was protected in the adjacent quarter; and the perptual jeal- 
ousy of the nations often burst forth in acts of violence and blood. 
Some adventurers, who disgraced the ensign of the cross, compensated 
their want of pay by the plunder of the Mohammedan villages; nine- 
teen Syrian merchants, who traded under the public faith, were de- 
spoiled and hanged by the Christians, and the denial of satisfaction 
justified the arms of the sultan Khalil. He marched against Acre at 
the head of sixty thousand horse and one hundred and forty thousand 
foot; his train of artillery (if I may use the word) was numerous and 
weighty; the separate timbers of a single engine were transported in 
one hundred waggons; and the royal historian Abulfeda, who served 
with the troops of Hannah, was himself a spectator of the holy war. 
Whatever might be the vices of the Franks, their courage was rekindled 
by enthusiasm and despair; but they were torn by the discord of seven- 
teen chiefs, and overwhelmed on all sides by the powers of the sultan. 
After a siege of thirty-three days the double wall was forced by the 
Moslems; the principal tower yielded to their engines; the Mamalukes 
made a general assault; the city was stormed, and death or slavery was 
the lot of sixty thousand Christians. The convent, or rather fortress, 
of the Templars resisted three days longer; but the great master was 
pierced with an arrow, and, of five hundred knights, only ten were left 
alive, less happy than the victims of the sword, if they lived to suffer 
on a scaffold in the unjust and cruel proscription of the whole order. 
The king of Jerusalem, the patriarch, and the great master of the hos- 
pital effected their retreat to the shore; but the sea was rough, the ves- 
sels were insufficient, and great numbers of the fugitives were drowned 
before they could reach the isle of Cyprus, which might comfort Lusi- 
gnan for the loss of Palestine. By the command of the sultan the 
churches and fortifications of the Latin cities were demolished: a motive 
of avarice or fear still opened the holy sepulchre to some devout and 
defenceless pilgrims: and a mournful and solitary silence prevailed

Bulgarians Isaac Angelas dethroned by his Brother Alexius Origin of 
the Fourth Crusade Alliance of the French and Venetians with the Son 
of Isaac Their Naval Expedition to Constantinople The Two Sieges and 
Final Conquest of the City by the Latins 

THE restoration of the Western empire by Charlemagne was speedily 
followed by the separation of the Greek and Lathi churches. 1 A re- 
ligious and national animosity still divides the two largest communions 
of the Christian world; and the schism of Constantinople, by alienat- 
ing her most useful allies, and provoking her most dangerous enemies, 
has precipitated the decline and fall of the Roman empire in the East. 
In the course of the present history the aversion of the Greeks for 
the Latins has been often visible and conspicuous. It was originally 
derived from the disdain of servitude, inflamed, after the tune of Con- 
stantine, by the pride of equality or dominion, and finally exasperated 
by the preference which their rebellious subjects had given to lie alli- 
ance of the Franks. In every age the Greeks were proud of their supe- 
riority in profane and religious knowledge: they had first received the 
light of Christianity; they had pronounced the decrees of the seven gen- 
eral councils; they alone possessed the language of Scripture and philos- 
ophy: nor should the barbarians, immersed in the darkness of the West, 2 
presume to argue on the high and mysterious questions of theological 
science. Those barbarians despised in their turn the restless and subtle 
levity of the Orientals, the authors of every heresy, and blessed their 
own simplicity, which was content to hold the tradition of the apostolic 
church. Yet in the seventh century the synods of Spain, and afterwards 
of France, improved or corrupted the Nicene creed, on the mysterious 
subject of the third person of the Trinity. 8 In the long controversies of 
the East the nature and generation of the Christ had been scrupulously

defined; and the well-known relation of father and son seemed to convey 
a faint image to the human mind. The idea of birth was less analogous 
to the Holy Spirit, who, instead of a divine gift or attribute, was con- 
sidered by the Catholics as a substance, a person, a god; he was not 
begotten, but in the orthodox style he proceeded. Did he proceed from 
the Father alone, perhaps by the Son? or from the Father and the Son? 
The first of these opinions was asserted by the Greeks, the second by 
the Latins; and the addition to the Nicene creed of the word filioque 
kindled the flame of discord between the Oriental and the Gallic 
churches. In the origin of the dispute the Roman pontiffs affected a 
character of neutrality and moderation: 4 they condemned the innova- 
tion, but they acquiesced in the sentiment, of their Transalpine breth- 
ren: they seemed desirous of casting a veil of silence and charity over 
the superfluous research; and in the correspondence of Charlemagne 
and Leo the Third, the pope assumes the liberality of a statesman, and 
the prince descends to the passions and prejudices of a priest. 5 But 
the orthodoxy of Rome spontaneously obeyed the impulse of her tem- 
poral policy; and the filioque, which Leo wished to erase, was tran- 
scribed in the symbol and chanted in the liturgy of the Vatican. The 
Nicene and Athanasian creeds are held as the Catholic faith, without 
which none can be saved; and both Papists and Protestants must now 
sustain and return the anathemas of the Greeks, who deny the proces- 
sion of the Holy Ghost from the Son as well as from the Father. Such 
articles of faith are not susceptible of treaty; but the rules of discipline 
will vary in remote and independent churches; and the reason, even of 
divines, might allow that the difference is inevitable and harmless. The 
craft or superstition of Rome has imposed on her priests and deacons 
the rigid obligation of celibacy; among the Greeks it is confined to the 
bishops; the loss is compensated by dignity or annihilated by age; and 
the parochial clergy, the papas, enjoy the conjugal society of the wives 
whom they have married before their entrance into holy orders. A 
question concerning the Azyms was fiercely debated in the eleventh cen- 
tury, and the essence of the Eucharist was supposed in the East and 
West to depend on the use of leavened or unleavened bread. Shall I 
mention hi a serious history the furious reproaches that were urged 
against the Latins, who for a long while remained on the defensive? 
They neglected to abstain, according to the apostolical decree, from 

* Before the shrine of St. Peter he placed two shields of the weight of 
94J4 pounds of pure silver; on which he inscribed the text of both creeds 
(utroque symbolo) pro amore et cautela orthodoxae fidei (Anastas. in Leon. 
III. in Muratori, torn. iii. pars i. p. 208). His language most clearly proves 
that neither the ftlioque nor the Athanasian creed were received at Rome 
about the year 830. 

'The Missi of Charlemagne pressed him to declare that all who rejected 
the filioque, at least the doctrine, must be damned. All, replies the pope, 
are not capable of reaching the altiora mysteria; qui potuerit, et non 
voluerit, sakus esse non potest (Collect ConciL torn. ix. p. 277-286). Ttw 
potuerit would leave a large loophole of salvation)

things strangled, and from blood: they fasted, a Jewish observance! 
on the Saturday of each week: during the first week of Lent they per- 
mitted the use of milk and cheese; 6 their infirm monks were indulged 
in the taste of flesh; and animal grease was substituted for the want of 
vegetable oil: the holy chrism or unction in baptism was reserved to 
the episcopal order; the bishops, as the bridegrooms of their churches, 
were decorated with rings; their priests shaved their faces, and bap- 
tised by a single immersion. Such were the crimes which provoked 
the zeal of the patriarchs of Constantinople, and which were justified 
with equal zeal by the doctors of the Latin church. 7 

Bigotry and national aversion are powerful magnifiers of every ob- 
ject of dispute; but the immediate cause of the schism of the Greeks 
may be traced in the emulation of the leading prelates, who maintained 
the supremacy of the old metropolis, superior to all, and of the reigning 
capital, inferior to none, in the Christian world. About the middle of 
the ninth century, Photius, 8 an ambitious layman, the captain of the 
guards and principal secretary, was promoted by merit and favour to 
the more desirable office of patriarch of Constantinople. In science, 
even ecclesiastical science, he surpassed the clergy of the age; and the 
purity of his morals has never been impeached: but his ordination was 
hasty, his rise was irregular; and Ignatius, his abdicated predecessor, 
was yet supported by the public compassion and the obstinacy of his 
adherents. They appealed to the tribunal . of Nicholas the First, one 
of the proudest and most -aspiring of the Roman pontiffs, who embraced 
the welcome opportunity of judging and condemning his rival of the 
East. Their quarrel was embittered by a conflict of jurisdiction over 
the king and nation of the Bulgarians; nor was their recent conversion 
to Christianity of much avail to either prelate, unless he could num- 
ber the proselytes among the subjects of his power. With the aid of his 
court the Greek patriarch was victorious; but in the furious contest 
he deposed in his turn the successor of St. Peter, and involved the 
Latin church in the reproach of heresy and schism. Photius sacrificed 
the peace of the world to a short and precarious reign: he fell with 
his patron, the Caesar Bardas; and Basil the Macedonian performed an 
act of justice in the restoration of Ignatius, .whose age and dignity 
had not been sufficiently respected. From his monastery, or prison, 
Photius solicited the favour of the emperor by pathetic complaints 
and artful flattery; and the eyes of his rival were scarcely closed when 

"In France, after some harsher laws, the ecclesiastical discipline is now 
relaxed:, milk, cheese, and butter are become a perpetual, and eggs an 
annual, indulgence in Lent (Vie privee des Francois, torn. ii. p. 27-38). 

T The original monuments of the schism, of the charges of the Greeks 
against the Latins, are deposited in the epistles of Photius (Epist Ency- 
clica, ii p. 47-6i) and of Michael Cerularius (Canisii Antiq. Lectiones, torn. 
VJ- p ^ **x p - 28l -324, edit Basnage, with the prolix answer of Cardinal 
Humbert).

he was again restored to the throne of Constantinople. After the 
death of Basil he experienced the vicissitudes of courts and the in- 
gratitude of a royal pupil: the patriarch was again deposed, and in his 
last solitary hours he might regret the freedom of a secular and studi- 
ous life. In each revolution the breath, the nod, of the sovereign had 
been accepted by a submissive clergy; and a synod of three hundred 
bishops was always prepared to hail the triumph, or to stigmatise the 
fall, of the holy, or the execrable, Photius. By a delusive promise 
of succour or reward, the popes were tempted to countenance these 
various proceedings; and the synods of Constantinople were ratified 
by their epistles or legate^. But the court and the people, Ignatius 
and Photius, were equally adverse to their claims; their ministers were 
insulted or imprisoned; the procession of the Holy Ghost was forgot- 
ten; Bulgaria was for ever annexed to the Byzantine throne; and the 
schism was prolonged by their rigid censure of all the multiplied ordi- 
nations of an irregular patriarch. The darkness and corruption of the 
tenth century suspended the intercourse, without reconciling the minds, 
of the two nations. But when the Norman sword restored the churches 
of Apulia to the jurisdiction of Rome, the departing flock was warned, 
by a petulant epistle of the Greek patriarch, to avoid and abhor the 
errors of the Latins, The rising majesty of Rome could no longer brook 
the insolence of a rebel; and Michael Cerularius was excommunicated 
in the heart of Constantinople by the pope's legates. Shaking the 
dust from their feet, they deposited on the altar of St. Sophia a direful 
anathema, 10 which enumerates the seven mortal heresies of the Greeks, 
and devotes the guilty teachers, and their unhappy sectaries, to the 
eternal society of the devil and his angels. According to the emer- 
gencies of the church and state, a friendly correspondence was some- 
times resumed; the language of charity and concord was sometimes 
affected; but the Greeks have never recanted their errors, the popes 
have never repealed their sentence; and from this thunderbolt we may 
date the consummation of the schism. It was enlarged by each am- 
bitious step of the Roman pontiffs: the emperors blushed and trem- 
bled at the ignominious fate of their royal brethren of Germany; and 
the people was scandalised by the temporal power and military life 
of the Latin dergy. 11 

The aversion of the Greeks and Latins was nourished and mani- 
fested in the three first expeditions to the Holy Land. Alexius Com- 

*The synod of Constantinople, held in the year 869, is the eighth of the 
general councils, the last assembly of the East which is recognised by the 
Roman church. She rejects the synods of Constantinople of the years 
867 and 879, which were, however, equally numerous and noisy; but they 
were favourable to Photius.

nenus contrived the absence at least of the formidable pilgrims: his 
successors, Manuel and Isaac Angelus, conspired with the Moslems for 
the ruin of the greatest princes of the Franks; and their crooked and 
malignant policy was seconded by the active and voluntary obedience 
of every order of their subjects. Of this hostile temper a large portion 
may doubtless be ascribed to the difference of language, dress, and 
manners, which severs and alienates the nations of the globe. The 
pride as well as the prudence of the sovereign was deeply wounded by 
the intrusion of foreign armies that claimed a right of traversing his 
dominions, and passing under the walls of his capital: his subjects 
were insulted and plundered by the rude strangers of the West: and 
the hatred of the pusillanimous Greeks was sharpened by secret envy 
of the bold and pious enterprises of the Franks. But these profane 
causes of national enmity were fortified and inflamed by the venom 
of religious zeal. Instead of a kind embrace, an hospitable reception 
from their Christian brethren of the East, every tongue was taught to 
repeat the names of schismatic and heretic, more odious to an ortho- 
dox ear than those of pagan and infidel: instead of being loved for 
the general conformity of faith and worship, they were abhorred for 
some rules of discipline, some questions of theology, in which them- 
selves or their teachers might differ from the Oriental church. In the 
crusade of Louis the Seventh the Greek clergy washed and purified 
the altars which had been defiled by the sacrifice of a French priest. 
The companions of Frederic Barbarossa deplore the injuries which 
they endured, both in word and deed, from the peculiar rancour of 
the bishops and monks. Their prayers and sermons excited the people 
against the impious barbarians; and the patriarch is accused of de- 
daring that the faithful might obtain the redemption of all their sins 
by the extirpation of the schismatics. 12 An enthusiast named Doro- 
theus alarmed the fears and restored the confidence of the emperor by 
a prophetic assurance that the German heretic, after assaulting the 
gate of Blachernes, would be made a signal example of the divine ven- 
geance. The passages of these mighty armies were rare and perilous 
events; but the crusades introduced a frequent and familiar intercourse 
between the two nations, which enlarged their knowledge without 
abating their prejudices. The wealth and luxury of Constantinople 
demanded the productions of every climate: these imports were bal- 
anced by the art and labour of her numerous inhabitants; her situa-

Baldwin fifteen years afterwards :^ Haec est (gens) quae Latinos omnes non

exaggeration, but it was as effectual for the action and re-action of hatred

tion invites the commerce of the world; and, in every period of her 
existence, that commerce has been in the hands of foreigners. After 
the decline of Amalphi, the Venetians, Pisans, and Genoese introduced 
their factories and settlements into the capital of the empire: their 
services were rewarded with honours and immunities; they acquired the 
possession of lands and houses, their families were multiplied by mar- 
riages with the natives, and, after the toleration of a Mohammedan 
mosque, it was impossible to interdict the churches of the Roman rite. 18 
The two wives of Manuel Comnenus " were of the race of the Franks: 
the first, a sister-in-law of the emperor Conrad; the second, a daughter 
of the prince of Antjoch: he obtained for his son Alexius a daughter 
of Philip Augustus king of France; and he bestowed his own daughter 
on a marquis of Montferrat, who was educated and dignified in the 
palace of Constantinople. The Greek encountered the arms, and as- 
pired to the empire, of the West: he esteemed the valour, and trusted 
the fidelity, of the Franks; 15 their military talents were unfitly recom- 
pensed by the lucrative offices of judges and treasurers; the policy of 
Manuel had solicited the alliance of the pope; and the popular voice 
accused him of a partial bias to the nation and religion of the Latins. 16 
During his reign and that of his successor Alexius, they were exposed 
at Constantinople to the reproach of foreigners, heretics, and favourites; 
and this triple guilt was severely expiated in the tumult which an- 
nounced the return and elevation of Andronicus. 17 The people rose 
in arms: from the Asiatic shore the tyrant despatched his troops and 
galleys to assist the national revenge; and the hopeless resistance of 
the strangers served only to justify the rage and sharpen the daggers 
of the assassins. Neither age, nor sex, nor the ties of friendship or 
kindred, could save the victims of national hatred, and avarice, and 
religious zeal: the Latins were slaughtered in their houses and in the 
streets; their quarter was reduced to ashes; the clergy were burnt 
in their churches, and the sick in their hospitals; and some estimate

may be formed of the slain from the clemency which sold above four 
thousand Christians in perpetual slavery to the Turks. The priests and 
monks were the loudest and most active in the destruction of the 
schismatics; and they chanted a thanksgiving to the Lord when the 
head of a Roman cardinal, the pope's legate, was severed from his body, 
fastened to the tail of a dog, and dragged, with savage mockery, 
through the city. The more diligent of lie strangers had retreated, 
on the first alarm, to their vessels, and escaped through the Hellespont 
from the scene of blood. In their flight they burnt and ravaged two 
hundred miles of the sea-coast, inflicted a severe revenge on the guilt- 
less subjects of the empire, marked the priests and monks as their 
peculiar enemies, and compensated, by the accumulation of plunder, 
the loss of their property and friends. On their return they exposed to 
Italy and Europe the wealth and weakness, the perfidy and malice of 
the Greeks, whose vices were painted as the genuine characters of 
heresy and schism. The scruples of the first crusaders had neglected 
the fairest opportunities of securing, by the possession of Constanti- 
nople, the way to the Holy Land: a domestic revolution invited, and 
almost compelled, the French and Venetians to achieve the conquest 
of the Roman empire of the East. 

In the series of the Byzantine princes I have exhibited the hypoc- 
risy and ambition, the tyranny and fall, of Andronicus, the last male 
of the Comnenian family who reigned a,t Constantinople. The revolu- 
tion which cast him headlong from the throne saved and exalted Isaac 
Angelus, 18 who descended by the females from .the same Imperial 
dynasty. The successor of a second Nero might have found it an easy 
task to deserve the esteem and affection of his subjects: they some- 
times had reason to regret the administration of Andronicus. The 
sound and vigorous mind of the tyrant was capable of discerning the 
connection between his own and the public interest; and while he was 
feared by all who could inspire him with fear, the unsuspected people, 
and the remote provinces, might bless the inexorable justice of their 
master. But his successor was vain and jealous of the supreme power, 
which he wanted courage and abilities to exercise: his vices were per- 
nicious, his virtues (if he possessed any virtues) were useless, to man- 
kind; and the Greeks, who imputed their calamities to his negligence, 
denied him the merit of any transient or accidental benefits of the 
times. Isaac slept on the throne, and was awakened only by the 
sound of pleasure: his vacant hours were amused by comedians and 
buffoons, and even to these buffoons the emperor was an object of con- 
tempt: his feasts and buildings exceeded the examples of royal luxury: 
the number of his eunuchs and domestics amounted to twenty thou- 

"The history of the reign of Isaac Angelus is composed in three books, 
by the senator Nicetas (p. 228-290) ; and his offices of logothete, or prin- 
cipal secretary, and judge of the veil or palace, could not bribe the impar- 
tiality of the historian. He wrote, it is true, after the fall and death of his 
benef artrr.

sand; and a daily sum of four thousand pounds of silver would swell 
to four millions sterling the annual expense of his household and table. 
His poverty was relieved by oppression; and the public discontent was 
inflamed by equal abuses in the collection and the application of the 
revenue. While the Greeks numbered the days of their servitude, a 
flattering prophet, whom he rewarded with the dignity of patriarch, 
assured him of a long and victorious reign of thirty-two years, during 
which he should extend his way to Mount Libanus, and his conquests 
beyond the Euphrates. But his only step towards the accomplishment 
of the prediction was a splendid and scandalous embassy to Saladin, 19 
to demand the restitution of the holy sepulchre, and to propose an 
offensive and defensive league with the enemy of the Christian name. 
In these unworthy hands, of Isaac and his brother, the remains of the 
Greek empire crumbled into dust. The island of Cyprus, whose name 
excites the ideas of elegance and pleasure, was usurped by his name- 
sake, a Comnenian prince; and by a strange concatenation of events, 
the sword of our English Richard bestowed that kingdom on the house 
of Lusignan, a rich compensation for the loss of Jerusalem. 

The honour of the monarchy and the safety of the capital were 
deeply wounded by the revolt of the Bulgarians and Walkchians. 
Since the victory of the second Basil, they had supported, above a 
hundred and seventy years, the loose dominion of the Byzantine 
princes; but no effectual measures had been adopted to impose the 
yoke of laws and manners on these savage tribes. By the command 
of Isaac, their sole means of subsistence, their flocks and herds, were 
driven away to contribute towards the pomp of the royal nuptials; 
and their fierce warriors were exasperated by the denial .of equal rank 
and pay in the military service. Peter and Asan, two powerful chiefs, 
of the race of the ancient kings, 20 asserted their own rights and the 
national freedom: their demoniac impostors proclaimed to the crowd 
that their glorious patron St. Demetrius had for ever deserted the 
cause of the Greeks: and the conflagration spread from the banks of 
the Danube to the hills of Macedonia and Thrace. After some faint 
efforts, Isaac Angelus and his brother acquiesced in their independ- 
ence; and the Imperial troops were soon discouraged by the bones of 
their fellow-soldiers that were scattered along the passes of Mount 
Haemus. By the arms and policy of John, or Joannices, the second 
kingdom of Bulgaria was firmly established. The subtle barbarian 
sent an embassy to Innocent the Third to acknowledge himself a genu- 

* See Bohadin, Vit Saladin. p. 129-131, 226, vers. Schultens. The ara- 
tassador of Isaac was equally versed in the Greek, French, and Arabic 
languages; a rare instance in those times. His embassies were received 
with honour, dismissed without effect, and reported with scandal in the 
West

ine son of Rome in descent and religion, 21 and humbly received from 
the pope the licence of coining money, the royal title, and a Latin 
archbishop or patriarch. The Vatican exulted in the spiritual conquest 
of Bulgaria, the first object of the schism; and if the Greeks could 
have preserved the prerogatives of the church, they would gladly have 
resigned the rights of the monarchy. 

The Bulgarians were malicious enough to pray for the long life of 
Isaac Angelus, the surest pledge of their freedom and prosperity. Yet 
their chiefs could involve in the same indiscriminate contempt the 
family and nation of the emperor. " In all the Greeks," said Asan to 
his troops, " the same climate, and character, and education, will be 
productive of the same fruits. Behold my lance," continued the war- 
rior, " and the long streamers that float in the wind. They differ only 
in colour; they are formed of the same silk, and fashioned by the 
same workman; nor has the stripe that is stained in purple any su- 
perior price or value above its fellows." 22 Several of these candidates 
for the purple successively rose and fell under the empire of Isaac: a 
general who had repelled the fleets of Sicily was driven to revolt and 
ruin by the ingratitude of the prince; and his luxurious repose was 
disturbed by secret conspiracies and popular insurrections. The em- 
peror was saved by accident, or the merit of his servants: for he was 
at length oppressed by an ambitious brother, who, for the hope of a 
precarious diadem, forgot the obligations of nature, of loyalty, and of 
friendship. 28 While Isaac in the Thracian valleys pursued the idle 
and solitary pleasures of the chase, his brother, Alexius Angelus, was 
invested with the purple by lie unanimous suffrage of the camp: the 
capital and the clergy subscribed to their choice; and the vanity of 
the new sovereign rejected the name of his fathers for the lofty and 
royal appellation of the Comnenian race. On the despicable character 
of Isaac I have exhausted the language of contempt, and can only add 
that in a reign of eight years the baser Alexius 2 * was supported by the 
masculine vices of his wife Euphrosyne. The first intelligence of his 
fall was conveyed to the late emperor by the hostile aspect and pursuit 

*The pope acknowledges his pedigree, a nobili urbis Romae prosapia 
genitores tui originem traxerunt. This tradition, and the strong resem- 
blance of the Latin and Wallachian idioms, are explained by M. D'Anville 
(Etats de 1'Europe, p. 258-262). The Italian colonies of the Dacia of 
Trajan were swept away by the tide of emigration from the Danube to the 
Volga, and brought back by another wave from the Volga to the Danube. 
Possible, but strange! 

31 This parable is in the best savage style; but I wish the Wallach had 
not introduced the classic name of Mysians, the experiment of the magnet 
or loadstone, and the passage of an old comic poet (Nicetas, in Alex. 
Comneno, L i. p. 299, 300 [ed. Par.; p. 613, ed. Bonn]). 

38 The Latins aggravate the ingratitude of Alexius, by supposing that he 
had been - released by his brother Isaac from Turkish captivity. This 
pathetic tale had doubtless been repeated at Venice and Zara; but I do 
not readily discover its grounds in the Greek historians.

of the guards, no longer his own: he fled before them above fifty miles 
as far as Stagyra in Macedonia; but the fugitive, without an object or 
a follower, was arrested, brought back to Constantinople, deprived of 
his eyes, and confined in a lonesome tower, on a scanty allowance of 
bread and water. At the moment of the revolution, his son Alexius, 
whom he educated in the hope of empire, was twelve years of age. 
He was spared by the usurper, and reduced to attend his triumph both 
in peace and war; but as lie army was encamped on the sea-shore, an 
Italian vessel facilitated the escape of the royal youth; and, in the 
disguise of a common sailor, he eluded the search of his enemies, passed 
the Hellespont, and found a secure refuge in the isle of Sicily. After 
saluting the threshold of the apostles, and imploring the protection of 
pope Innocent the Third, Alexius accepted the kind invitation of his 
sister Irene, the wife of Philip of Swabia, king of the Romans. But hi 
his passage through Italy he heard that the flower of Western chivalry 
was assembled at Venice for the deliverance of the Holy Land; and a 
ray of hope was kindled in his bosom that their invincible swords 
might be employed in his father's restoration. 

About ten or twelve years after the loss of Jerusalem, the nobles of 
France were again summoned to the holy war by the voice of a third 
prophet, less extravagant, perhaps, than Peter the Hermit, but far be- 
low St. Bernard in the merit of an orator and a statesman. An illiterate 
priest of the neighbourhood of Paris, Fulk of Neuilly, 25 forsook his 
parochial duty, to assume the more flattering character of a popular 
and itinerant missionary. The fame of his sanctity and miracles waa 
spread over the land: he declaimed, with severity and vehemence, 
against the vices of the age; and his sermons, which he preached in the 
streets of Paris, converted the robbers, the usurers, the prostitutes, and 
even the doctors and scholars of the university. No sooner did Inno- 
cent the Third ascend the chair of St. Peter than he proclaimed in 
Italy, Germany, and France, the obligation of a new crusade. 26 The 
eloquent pontiff described the ruin of Jerusalem, the triumph of the 
Pagans, and the shame of Christendom: his liberality proposed the re- 
demption of sins, a plenary indulgence to all who should serve in Pal- 
estine, either a year in person, or two years by a substitute: 27 and 
among his legates and orators who blew the sacred trumpet, Fulk of 
Neuiily was the loudest and most successful. The situation of the 
principal monarchs was averse to the pious summons. The emperor

Frederic the Second was a child; and his kingdom of Germany was 
disputed by the rival houses of Brunswick and Swabia, the memorable 
factions of the Guelphs and Ghibelines. Philip Augustus of France 
had performed, and could not be persuaded to renew, the perilous vow; 
but as he was not less ambitious of praise than of power, he cheerfully 
instituted a perpetual fund for the defence of the Holy Land. Richard 
of England was satiated with the glory and misfortunes of his first 
adventure, and he presumed to deride the exhortations of Fulk of 
Neuilly, who was not abashed in the presence of kings. " You advise 
me," said Plantagenet, " to dismiss my three daughters, pride, avarice, 
and incontinence: I bequeath them to the most deserving; my pride to 
the knights-templars, my avarice to the monks of Cisteaux, and my in- 
continence to the prelates." But the preacher was heard and obeyed 
by the great vassals, the princes of the second order; and Theobald, 
or Thibaut, count of Champagne, was the foremost in the holy race. 
The valiant youth, at the age of twenty-two years, was encouraged by 
the domestic examples of his father, who marched in the second cru- 
sade, and of his elder brother, who had ended his days in Palestine 
with the title of King of Jerusalem: two thousand two hundred knights 
owed service and homage to his peerage: 28 the nobles of Champagne 
excelled in all the exercises of war; 29 and, by his marriage with the 
heiress of Navarre, TMbaut could draw a band of hardy Gascons from 
either side of the Pyrenaean mountains. His companion in arms was 
Louis count of Blois and Chartres; like himself of regal lineage, for 
both the princes were nephews, at the same time, of the kings of France 
and England. In a crowd of prelates and barons, who imitated their 
zeal, I distinguish the birth and merit of Matthew of Montmorency; 
the famous Simon of Montfort, the scourge of the Albigeois; and a 
valiant noble, Jeffrey of Villehardouin, 30 marshal of Champagne, 81 who 
has condescended, in the rude idiom of his age and country, 32 to write 

* This number of fiefs (of which 1800 owed liege homage) was enrolled in 
the church of St. Stephen at Troyes, and attested, A.D. 1213, by the marshal 
and butler of Champagne (Ducange, Observ. p. 254).

30 The name of Villehardouin was taken from a village and castle in the 
diocese of Troyes, near the river Aube, between Bar and Arcis. The family 
was ancient and noble: the elder branch of our historian existed after the 
year 1400; the younger, which acquired the principality of Achaia, merged 
in the house of Savoy (Ducange, p. 235-245). 

"This office was held by his father and his descendants; but Ducange 
has not hunted it with his usual sagacity. I find that, in the year 1356, it 
was in the family of Conflans; but these provincial have been long since 
eclipsed by the national marshals of France. 

"This language, of which I shall produce some specimens, is explained 
by Vigenere and Ducange, in a version and glossary. The President Des 
Brosses (Mechanisme des Langues, torn. ii. p. 83) gives it as the example of 
a language which has ceased to be French, and is understood only by 
grammarians.

or dictate 53 an original narrative of the councils and actions in which 
he bore a memorable part At the same time, Baldwin count oi 
Flanders, who had married the sister of Thibaut, assumed the cross 
at Bruges, with his brother Henry and the principal knights and citi- 
zens of that rich and industrious province. 8 * The vow which the chiefs 
had pronounced in churches, they ratified in tournaments: the opera- 
tions of the war were debated in full and frequent assemblies: and it 
was resolved to seek the deliverance of Palestine in Egypt, a country, 
since Saladin's death, which was almost ruined by famine and civil 
war. But the fate of so many royal armies displayed the toils and 
perils of a land expedition; and if the Flemings dwelt along the ocean, 
the French barons were destitute of ships and ignorant of navigation. 
They embraced the wise resolution of choosing six deputies or repre- 
sentatives, of whom Villehardouin was one, with a discretionary trust 
to direct the motions, and to pledge the faith, of the whole confederacy. 
The maritime states of Italy were alone possessed of the means of 
transporting the holy warriors with their arms and horses; and the sis 
deputies proceeded to Venice to solicit, on motives of piety or interest, 
the aid of that powerful republic. 

In the invasion of Italy by Attila, I have mentioned a5 the flight of 
the Venetians from the fallen cities of the continent, and their obscure 
shelter in the chain of islands that line the extremity of the Adriatic 
Gulf. In the midst of the waters, free, indigent, laborious, and inac- 
cessible, they gradually coalesced into a republic: the first foundations 
of Venice were laid in the island of Rialto; and the annual election of 
the twelve tribunes was superseded by the permanent office of a (Juke 
or doge. On the verge of the two empires, the Venetians exult in the 
belief of primitive and perpetual independence. 56 Against the Latins 
their antique freedom has been asserted by the sword, and may b&amp; 
justified by the pen. Charlemagne himself resigned all claims of sover- 
eignty to the islands of the Adriatic Gulf: his son Pepin was repulsed 
in the attacks of the lagunas or canals, too deep for the cavalry, and 
too shallow for the vessels; and in every age, under the German 
Caesars, the lands of the republic have been dearly distinguished from

that he could neither read nor write. Yet Champagne may boast of the 
two first historians* the noble authors of French prose, Villehardouin and 
Joinville. 

"The crusade and reigns of the counts of Flanders, Baldwin and Jus 
brother Henry, are the subject of a particular history by the Jesuit Doutre- 
mens (Constantinopolis Belgica; Turnaci, 1638, in 4to), which I have only 
seen with the eyes of Ducange.

Chorograph. Italiae medii JEvi, in Muratori, Script, torn. x. p. 153). Th*

the kingdom of Italy. But the inhabitants of Venice were considered 
by themselves, by strangers, and by their sovereigns, as an inalienable 
portion of the Greek empire: 87 in the ninth and tenth centuries the 
proofs of their subjection are numerous and unquestionable; and the 
vain titles, the servile honours, of the Byzantine court, so ambitiously 
solicited by their dukes, would have degraded the magistrates of a 
free people. But the bands of this dependence, which was never abso- 
lute or rigid, were imperceptibly relaxed by the ambition of Venice 
and the weakness of Constantinople. Obedience was softened into re- 
spect, privilege ripened into prerogative, and the freedom of domestic 
government was fortified by the independence of foreign dominion. 
The maritime cities of Istria and Dalmatia bowed to the sovereigns of 
the Adriatic; and when they armed against the Normans in the cause 
of Alexius, the emperor applied, not to the duty of his subjects, but to 
the gratitude and generosity of his faithful allies. The sea was their 
patrimony: 88 the western parts of the Mediterranean, from Tuscany 
to Gibraltar, were indeed abandoned to their rivals of Pisa and Genoa; 
but the Venetians acquired an early and lucrative share of the com- 
merce of Greece and Egypt. Their riches increased with the increasing 
demand of Europe: their manufactures of silk and glass, perhaps the 
institution of their bank, are of high antiquity; and they enjoyed the 
fruits of their industry in the magnificence of public and private life. 
To assert her flag, to avenge her injuries, to protect the freedom of 
navigation, the republic could launch and man a fleet of a hundred 
galleys; and the Greeks, the Saracens, and the Normans were encoun-

annual tribute, which the emperor allows them tc pay to the king of Italy, 
alleviates, by doubling, their servitude; but the hateful word Sov\ol must 
be translated, as in the charter of 827 (Laugier, Hist, de Venise, torn. i. p. 67,

[Venice was dependent upon Constantinople until about 836, about which 
time the weakness of the Eastern empire permitted her to throw off the 
yoke. Under the Doge Peter Tradonicus, by military expeditions against 
the Slavonic pirates that invested the Adriatic, and the Saracens who 
carried their depredations to Dalmatia and the northern section of the 
Eastern Riviera, and by entering into independent compacts with the neigh- 
bouring cities of Italy, Venice changed her condition from that of a prov- 
ince to that of a responsible power, and when the Eastern empire regained! 
strength under Basil it was impossible to recall her to her former sub- 
ordinate position. From the eleventh century onward, Venice slowly but 
surely grew in influence and power. Cf. The Venetian Republic, by Horatio- 
Brown (Dent's Cyclopaedic Primers, 1903). O. S.]

eignty of a city, the first seat of the commerce of the world. The pol- 
icy of Venice was marked by the avarice of a trading, and the insolence 
of a maritime power; yet her ambition was prudent: nor did she often 
forget that, if 'armed galleys were the effect and safeguard, merchant 
vessels were the cause and supply, of her greatness. In her religion 
she avoided the schism of the Greeks, without yielding a servile obedi- 
ence to the Roman pontiff; and a free intercourse with the infidels of 
every dime appears to have allayed betimes the fever of superstition. 
Her primitive government was a loose mixture of democracy and mon- 
archy: the doge was elected by the votes of the general assembly; as 
long as he was popular and successful, he reigned with the pomp and 
authority of a prince; but in the frequent revolutions of the state, he 
was deposed, or banished, or slain, by the justice or injustice of the 
multitude. The twelfth century produced the first rudiments of the 
wise and jealous aristocracy, which has reduced the doge to a pageant, 
and the people to a cipher. 89 

When the six ambassadors of the French pilgrims arrived at Venice, 
they were hospitably entertained in the palace of St. Mark, by the 
reigning duke: his name was Henry Dandolo;* and he shone in the 
last period of human life as one of the most illustrious characters of 
the times. Under the weight of years, and after the loss of his eyes,* 1 
Dandolo retained a sound understanding and a manly courage; the 
spirit of a hero, ambitious to signalise his reign by some memorable 
exploits; and the wisdom of a patriot, anxious to build his fame on 
the glory and advantage of his country. He praised the bold enthusi- 
asm and liberal confidence of the barons and their deputies: in such 
a cause, and with such associates, he should aspire, were he a private

constitutional part. 

40 Henry Dandolo was eighty- four at his election (A.D. 1192), and ninety* 
seven at his death (A.D. 1205). See the Observations of Ducange sur Ville- 
"hardouin, No. 204. But this extraordinary longevity is not observed by 
the original writers, nor does there exist another example of a hero near 
.a hundred years of age. Theophrastus might afford an instance of a 

writer of ninety-nine; but instead of hvej^Kovra (Procem. ad Character.), 
I am much inclined to read epSo/jtfKovra, with his last editor Fischer, and 
the first thoughts of Casaubon. It is scarcely possible that the powers of 
the mind and body should support themselves till such a period of life. 

41 The modern Venetians (Laugier, torn. ii. p. 119) accuse the emperor 
Manuel; but the calumny is refuted by Villehardouin and the older writers, 

-who suppose that Dandolo lost his eyes by a wound (No. 34, and Ducange).

man, to terminate his life; but he was the servant of the republic, and 
some delay was requisite to consult, on this arduous business, the 
judgment of his colleagues. The proposal of the French was first de- 
bated by the six sages who had been recently appointed to control 
the administration of the doge: it was next disclosed to the forty 
members of the council of state; and finally communicated to the leg- 
islative assembly of four hundred and fifty representatives, who were 
annually chosen in the six quarters of the city. In peace and war the 
doge was still the chief of the republic; his legal authority was sup- 
ported by the personal reputation of Dandolo; his arguments of public 
interest were balanced and approved; and he was authorised to inform 
the ambassadors of the following conditions of the treaty. 42 It was 
proposed that the crusaders should assemble at Venice on the feast 
of St. John of the ensuing year; that flat-bottomed vessels should be 
prepared for four thousand five hundred horses and nine thousand 
squires, with a number of ships sufficient for the embarkation of four 
thousand five hundred knights and twenty thousand foot: that during 
a term of nine months they should be supplied with provisions, and 
transported to whatsoever coast the service of God and Christendom 
should require; and that the republic should join the armament with 
a squadron of fifty galleys. It was required that the pilgrims should 
pay, before their departure, a sum of eighty-five thousand marks of 
silver; and that all conquests, by sea and land, should be equally di- 
vided between the confederates. The terms were hard; but the emer- 
gency was pressing, and the French .barons were not less profuse of 
money than of blood. A general assembly was convened to ratify the 
treaty: the stately chapel and place of St. Mark were filled with ten 
thousand citizens; and the noble deputies were taught a new lesson 
of humbling themselves before the majesty of the people. " Illustrious 
Venetians," said the marshal of Champagne, "we are sent by the 
greatest and most powerful barons of France to implore the aid of the 
master of the sea for the deliverance of Jerusalem. They have en- 
joined us to fall prostrate at your feet; nor will we rise from the 
ground till you have promised to avenge with us the injuries of Christ." 
The eloquence of their words and tears,* 8 their martial aspect and sup- 
pliant attitude, were applauded by a universal shout; as it were, says 
Jeffrey, by the sound of an earthquake. The venerable doge ascended 
the pulpit to urge their request by those motives of honour and virtue 
which alone can be offered to a popular assembly: the treaty was tran- 
scribed on parchment, attested with oaths and seals, mutually accepted 

48 See the original treaty in the Chronicle of Andrew Dandolo, p. 323-326

by the weeping and joyful representatives of France and Venice, and 
despatched to Rome for the approbation of pope Innocent the Third. 
Two thousand marks were borrowed of the merchants for the first ex- 
penses of the armament. Of the six deputies, two repassed the Alps 
to announce their success, while their four companions made a fruitless 
trial of the zeal and emulation of the republics of Genoa and Pisa. 

The execution of the treaty was still opposed by unforeseen diffi- 
culties and delays. The marshal, on his return to Troyes, was em- 
braced and approved by Thibaut count of Champagne, who had been 
unanimously chosen general of the confederates. But the health of 
that valiant youth already declined, and soon became hopeless; and he 
deplored the untimely fate which condemned him to expire, not in a 
field of battle, but on a bed of sickness. To his brave and numerous 
vassals the dying prince distributed his treasures: they swore in his 
presence to accomplish his vow and their own; but some there were, 
says the marshal, who accepted his gifts and forfeited their word. The 
more resolute champions of the cross held a parliament at Soissons for 
the election of a new general; but such was the incapacity, or jeal- 
ousy, or reluctance, of the princes of France, that none could be found 
both able and willing to assume the conduct of the enterprise. They 
acquiesced in the choice of a stranger, of Boniface marquis of Mont- 
ferrat, descended of a race of heroes, and himself of conspicuous fame 
in the wars and negotiations of the times; 4 * nor could the piety or am- 
bition of the Italian chief decline this honourable invitation. After 
visiting the French court, where he was received as a friend and kins- 
man, die marquis, in the church of Soissons, was invested with the 
cross of a pilgrim and the staff of a general; and immediately repassed 
the Alps, to prepare for the distant expedition of the East. About the 
festival of the Pentecost he displayed his banner, and marched towards 
Venice at the head of the Italians: he was preceded or followed by the 
counts of Flanders and Blois and the most respectable barons of 
France; and their numbers were swelled by the pilgrims of Germany, 45 
whose object and motives were similar to their own. The Venetians 
had fulfilled, and even surpassed, their engagements: stables were con- 
structed for the horses, and barracks for the troops; the magazines 
were abundantly replenished with forage and provisions; and the fleet 
of transports, ships, and galleys, was ready to hoist sail as soon as the 
republic had received the price of the freight and armament. But that 
price far exceeded the wealth of the crusaders who were assembled at 
Venice. The Flemings, whose obedience to their count was voluntary 
and precarious, had embarked in their vessels for the long navigation

of the ocean and Mediterranean; and many of the French and Italians 
had preferred a cheaper and more convenient passage from Marseilles 
and Apulia to the Holy Land. Each pilgrim might complain that, 
after he had furnished his own contribution, he was made responsible 
for the deficiency of his absent brethren: the gold and silver plate of 
the chiefs, which they freely delivered to the treasury of St. Mark, was 
a generous but inadequate sacrifice; and after all their efforts, thirty- 
four thousand marks were still wanting to complete the stipulated 
sum. The obstacle was removed by the policy and patriotism of the 
doge, who proposed to the barons that, if they would join their arms 
in reducing some revolted cities of Dalmatia, he would expose his per- 
son in the holy war, and obtain from the republic a long indulgence, 
till some wealthy conquest should afford the means of satisfying the 
debt. After much scruple and hesitation, they chose rather to accept 
the offer than to relinquish the enterprise; and the first hostilities of 
the fleet and army were directed against Zara, 46 a strong city of the 
Sdavonian coast, which had renounced its allegiance to Venice, and 
implored the protection of the king of Hungary. 47 The crusaders burst 
the chain or boom of the harbour; landed their horses, troops, and 
military engines; and compelled the inhabitants, after a defence of five 
days, to surrender at discretion: their lives were spared, but the revolt 
was punished by the pillage of their houses and the demolition of their 
walls. The season was far advanced; the French and Venetians re- 
solved to pass the winter in a secure harbour and plentiful country; 
but their repose was disturbed by national and tumultuous quarrels 
of the soldiers and mariners. The conquest of Zara had scattered the 
seeds of discord and scandal: the arms of the allies had been stained 
in their outset with the blood, not of infidels, but of Christians: the 
king of Hungary and his new subjects were themselves enlisted under 
the banner of the cross; and the scruples of the devout were magnified 
by the fear or lassitude of the reluctant pilgrims. The pope had ex- 
communicated the false crusaders who had pillaged and massacred 
their brethren, 48 and only the marquis Boniface and Simon of Mont- 
fort escaped these spiritual thunders; the one by his absence from the 
siege, the other by his final departure from the camp. Innocent might 
absolve the simple and submissive penitents of France; but he was

provoked by the stubborn reason of the Venetians, who refused to con- 
fess their guilt, to accept their pardon, or to allow, in their temporal 
concerns, the interposition of a priest. 

The assembly of such formidable powers by sea and land had re- 
vived the hopes of young 40 Alexius, and both at Venice and Zara he 
solicited the arms of the crusaders for his own restoration and his 
father's co deliverance. The royal youth was recommended by Philip 
king of Germany; his prayers and presence excited the compassion of 
the camp, and his cause was embraced and pleaded by the marquis of 
Montferrat and the doge of Venice. A double alliance, and the dignity 
of Caesar, had connected with the Imperial family the two elder 
brothers of Boniface; 81 he expected to derive a kingdom from the im- 
portant service; and the more generous ambition of Dandolo was eager 
to secure the inestimable benefits of trade and dominion that might 
accrue to his country. 52 Their influence procured a favourable audi- 
ence for the ambassadors of Alexius; and if the magnitude of his offers 
excited some suspicion, the motives and rewards which he displayed 
might justify the delay and diversion of those forces which had been 
consecrated to the deliverance of Jerusalem. He promised, in his own 
and his father's name, that, as soon as they should be seated on the 
throne of Constantinople, they would terminate the long schism of the 
Greeks, and submit themselves and their people to the lawful suprem- 
acy of the Roman church. He engaged to recompense the labours and 
merits of the crusaders by the immediate payment of two hundred thou- 
sand "marks of silver; to accompany them in person to Egypt; or, if 
it should be judged more advantageous, to maintain, during a year, ten 
thousand men, and, during his life, five hundred knights, for the 
service of the Holy Land. These tempting conditions were accepted 
by the republic of Venice, and the eloquence of the doge and marquis 
persuaded the counts of Flanders, Blois, and St. Pol, with eight barons 
of France, to join in the glorious enterprise. A treaty of offensive and 

*A modern reader is surprised to hear of the valet de Constantinople, 
as applied to young Alexius, on account of his youth, like the infants of 
Spain, and the nobilissimus puer of the Romans. The pages and valets of 
the knights were as noble as themselves (Villehardouin and Ducange, 
No. 36).

a Reinier and Conrad : the former married Maria, daughter of the emperor 
Manuel Comnenus; the latter was the husband of Theodora Angela, sister 
of the emperors Isaac and Alexius. Conrad abandoned the Greek court 
and princess for the glory of defending Tyre against Saladin (Ducange, 
Fam. Byzant. p. 187, 203). 

"Nicetas (in Alexio Comneno, 1. iii. c. 9 [p. 715, ed. Bonn]) accuses the

522 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

defensive alliance was confirmed by their oaths and seals; and each in- 
dividual, according to his situation and character, was swayed by the 
hope of public or private advantage; by the honour of restoring an 
exiled monarch; or by the sincere and probable opinion that their 
efforts in Palestine would be fruitless and unavailing, and that the ac- 
quisition of Constantinople must precede and prepare the recovery of 
Jerusalem. But they were the chiefs or equals of a valiant band of 
freemen and volunteers, who thought and acted for themselves: the 
soldiers and clergy were divided; and, if a large majority subscribed 
to the alliance, the numbers and arguments of the dissidents were 
strong and respectable. 53 The boldest hearts were appalled by the re- 
port of the naval power and impregnable strength of Constantinople, 
and their apprehensions were disguised to the world, and perhaps to 
themselves, by the more decent objections of religion and duty. They 
alleged the sanctity of a vow which had drawn them from their families 
and homes to the rescue of the holy sepulchre; nor should the dark 
and crooked counsels of human policy divert them from a pursuit, the 
event of which was in the hands of the Almighty. Their first offence, 
the attack of Zara, had been severely punished by the reproach .of 
their conscience and the censures of the pope, nor would they again 
imbrue their hands in the blood of their fellow Christians. The apostle 
of Rome had pronounced; nor would they usurp the right of avenging 
with the sword- the schism of the Greeks and the doubtful usurpation 
of the Byzantine monarch. On these principles or pretences many pil- 
grims, the most distinguished for their valour and piety, withdrew from 
the camp; and their retreat was less pernicious than the open or secret 
opposition of a discontented party that laboured, on every occasion, to 
separate the army and disappoint the enterprise. 

Notwithstanding this defection, the departure of the fleet and army 
was vigorously pressed by the Venetians, whose zeal for the service of 
the royal youth concealed a just resentment to his nation and family. 
They were mortified by the recent preference which had been given to 
Pisa, the rival of their trade; they had a long arrear of debt and injury 
to liquidate with the Byzantine court; and Dandolo might not discour- 
age the popular tale that he had been deprived of his eyes by the emperor 
Manuel, who perfidiously violated the sanctity of an ambassador. A 
similar armament, for ages, had not rode the Adriatic: it was composed 
of one hundred and twenty flat-bottomed vessels or palanders for the 
horses, two hundred and forty transports filled with men and arms, 
seventy store-ships laden with provisions, and fifty stout galleys well 
prepared for the encounter of an enemy. 5 * While the wind was f avour-

able, the sky serene, and the water smooth, every eye was fixed with 
wonder and delight on the scene of military and naval pomp which over- 
spread the sea. The shields of the knights and squires, at once an orna- 
ment and a defence, were arranged on either side of the ships; the ban- 
ners of the nations and families were displayed from the stern; our mod- 
ern artillery was supplied by three hundred engines for casting stones 
and darts; the fatigues of the way were cheered with the sound of music; 
and the spirits of the adventurers were raised by the mutual assurance 
that forty thousand Christian heroes were equal to the conquest of the 
world. 05 In the navigation co from Venice and Zara the fleet was suc- 
cessfully steered by lie skill and experience of the Venetian pilots: at 
Durazzo the confederates first landed on the territories of the Greek 
empire; the isle of Corfu afforded a station and repose; they doubled, 
without accident, the perilous cape of Malea, the southern point of 
Peloponnesus or the Morea; made a descent in the islands of Negropont 
and Andros; and cast anchor at Abydus on the Asiatic side of the Hel- 
lespont. These preludes of conquest were easy and bloodless; the 
Greeks of the provinces, without patriotism or courage, were crushed 
"by an irresistible force; the presence of the lawful heir might justify 
their obedience, and it was rewarded by the modesty and discipline of 
the Latins. As they penetrated through the Hellespont, the magnitude 
of their navy was compressed in a narrow charniel, and the face of the 
^waters was darkened with innumerable sails. They again expanded in 
the basin of the Propontis, and traversed that placid sea, till they ap- 
proached the European shore at the abbey of St. Stephen, three leagues 
to the west of Constantinople. The prudent doge dissuaded them from 
dispersing themselves in a populous and hostile land; and, as their 
stock of provisions was reduced, it was resolved, in the season of har- 
vest, to replenish their storeships in the fertile islands of the Propontis. 
With this resolution they directed their course; but a strong gale and 
their own impatience drove them to the eastward, and so near did they 
run to the shore and the city, that some volleys of stones and darts 
were exchanged between the ships and the rampart. As they passed 
3long, they gazed with admiration on the capital of the East, or, as it 
should seem, of the earth, rising from her seven hills, and towering over 
the continents of Europe and Asia. The swelling domes and lofty 
spires of five hundred palaces and churches were gilded by the sun and 
reflected in the waters; the walls were crowded with soldiers and spec- 
tators, whose number they beheld, of whose temper they were ignor-

ant; and each heart was chilled by the reflection that, since the begin- 
ning of the world, such an enterprise had never been undertaken by 
such a handful of warriors. But the momentary apprehension was dis- 
pelled by hope and valour; and every man, says the marshal of Cham- 
pagne, glanced his eye on the sword or lance which he must speedily use 
in the glorious conflict. 57 The Latins cast anchor before Chalcedon; 
the mariners only were left in the vessels; the soldiers, horses, and arms 
were safely landed; and, in the luxury of an Imperial palace, the barons 
tasted the first fruits of their success. On the third day the fleet and 
army moved towards Scutari, the Asiatic suburb of Constantinople: a 
detachment of five hundred Greek horse was surprised and defeated by 
fourscore French knights; and in a halt of nine days the camp was 
plentifully supplied with forage and provisions. 

In relating the invasion of a great empire, it may seem strange that 
I have not described the obstacles which should have checked the prog- 
ress of the strangers. The Greeks, in truth, were an unwarlike people; 
but they were rich, industrious, and subject to the will of a single man; 
had that man been capable of fear when his enemies were at a distance, 
or of courage when they approached his person. The first rumour of 
his nephew's alliance with the French and Venetians was despised by the 
usurper Alexius: his flatterers persuaded him that in this contempt he 
was bold and sincere; and each evening, in the close of the banquet, he 
thrice discomfited the barbarians of the West. These barbarians had 
been justly terrified by the report of his naval power; and the sixteen 
hundred fishing-boats of Constantinople 5S could have manned a fleet 
to sink them in the Adriatic, or stop their entrance in the mouth of the 
Hellespont. But all force may be annihilated by the negligence of the 
prince and the venality of his ministers. The great duke or admiral 
made a scandalous, almost a public, auction of the sails, the masts, and 
the rigging; the royal forests were reserved for the more important' pur- 
pose of the chase; and the trees, says Nicetas, were guarded by the eu- 
nuchs like the groves of religious worship. 69 From his dream of pride 
Alexius was awakened by the siege of Zara and the rapid advances of 
the Latins; as soon as he saw the danger was real, he thought it inevi- 
table, and his vain presumption was lost in abject despondency and 
despair. He suffered these contemptible barbarians to pitch their camp 
in the sight of the palace, and his apprehensions were thinly disguised 
by the pomp and menace of a suppliant embassy. The sovereign of the 
Romans was astonished (his ambassadors were instructed to say) at the

hostile appearance of the strangers. If these pilgrims were sincere in 
their vow for the deliverance of Jerusalem, his voice must applaud, and 
treasures should assist, their pious design; but should they dare to 
invade the sanctuary of empire, their numbers, were they ten times 
more considerable, should not protect them from his just resentment. 
The answer of the doge and barons was simple and magnanimous. " In 
the cause of honour and justice," they said, " we despise the usurper 
of Greece, his threats, and his offers. Our friendship and his allegiance 
are due to the lawful heir, to the young prince who is seated among us, 
and to his father the emperor Isaac, who has been deprived of his scep- 
tre, his freedom, and his eyes by the crime of an ungratef til brother. Let 
that brother confess his guilt and implore forgiveness, and we ourselves 
will intercede that he may be permitted to live in affluence and security. 
But let him not insult us by a second message: our reply will be made 
in arms, in the palace of Constantinople." 

On the tenth day of their encampment at Scutari the crusaders pre- 
pared themselves, as soldiers and as Catholics, for the passage of the 
Bosphorus. Perilous indeed was the adventure: the stream was broad 
and rapid; in a calm the current of the Euxine might drive down the 
liquid and unextinguishable fire of the Greeks, and the opposite shores 
of Europe were defended by seventy thousand horse and foot in for- 
midable array. On this memorable day, which happened to be bright 
and pleasant, the Latins were distributed in six battles or divisions; 
the first, or vanguard, was led by the count of Flanders, one of the most 
powerful of the Christian princes in the skill and number of his cross- 
bows. The four successive battles of the French were commanded by 
his brother Henry, the counts of St. Pol and Blois, and Matthew of 
Montmorency, the last of whom was honoured by the voluntary service 
of the marshal and nobles of Champagne. The sixth division, the rear- 
guard and reserve of the army, was conducted by the marquis of Mont- 
ferrat, at the head of the Germans and Lombards. The chargers, sad- 
dled, with their long caparisons dragging on the ground, were embarked 
in the flat palanders, 00 and the knights stood by the side of their horses, 
in complete armour, the helmets laced, and their lances in their hands. 
Their numerous train of Serjeants fll and archers occupied the transports, 
and each transport was towed by the strength and swiftness of a galley. 
The six divisions traversed the Bosphorus without encountering an 

00 From the version of Vigenere I adopt the well-sounding word palander, 
which is stell used, I believe, in the Mediterranean. But had I written in 
French, I should have preferred the original and expressive denomination 
of vessiers or huissiers, from the huis t or door, which was let down as a 
drawbridge; but which, at sea, was closed into the side of the ship. (See 
Ducange au Villehardouin, No. 14, and Joinville, p. 27, 28, edit, du Louvre.) 

81 To avoid the vague expressions of followers, etc., I use, after Ville-

enemy or an obstacle; to land the foremost was the wish, to conquer or 
die was the resolution, of every division and of every soldier. Jealous 
of the pre-eminence of danger, the knights in their heavy armour leaped 
into the sea when it rose as high as their girdle; the Serjeants and arch- 
ers were animated by their valour; and the squires, letting down the 
drawbridges of the palanders, led the horses to the shore. Before the 
squadrons could mount, and form, and couch their lances, the seventy 
thousand Greeks had vanished from their sight; tike timid Alexius gave 
the example to his troops, and it was only by the plunder of his rich 
pavilions that the Latins were informed that they had fought against an 
emperor. In the first consternation of the flying enemy, they resolved, 
by a double attack, to open the entrance of the harbour. The tower of 
Galata, 62 in the suburb of Pera, was attacked and stormed by the 
French, while the Venetians assumed the more difficult task of forcing 
the boom or chain that was stretched from that tower to the Byzantine 
shore. After some fruitless attempts their intrepid perseverance pre- 
vailed; twenty ships of war, the relics of the Grecian navy, were either 
sunk or taken; the enormous and massy links of iron were cut asunder 
by the shears or broken by the weight of the galleys; 68 and the Venetian 
fleet, safe and triumphant, rode at anchor in the port of Constantinople. 
By these daring achievements a remnant of twenty thousand Latins 
solicited the licence of besieging a capital which contained above four 
hundred thousand inhabitants, 6 * able, though not willing, to bear arms 
in the defence of their country. Such an account would indeed suppose 
a population of near two millions: but whatever abatement may be 
required in the numbers of the Greeks, the belief of those numbers will 
equally exalt the fearless spirit of their assailants. 

In the choice of the attack the French and Venetians were divided 
by their habits of life and warfare. The former affirmed with truth 
that Constantinople was most accessible on the side of the sea and the 
harbour. The latter might assert with honour that they had long 

"It is needless to observe that on the subject of Galata, the chain, etc, 
Ducange is accurate and full. Consult likewise the proper chapters of the 
C P. Christiana of the same author. The inhabitants of Galata were so 
vain and ^ ignorant, that they applied to themselves St. Paul's Epistle to 
the Galatians. 

88 The vessel that broke the chain was named the Eagle, Aquila (DandoL 
Chronicon, p. 322), which Blondus (de Gestis Venet) has changed into 
Aquilo, the north-wind. Ducange, Observations, No. 83, maintains the 
latter reading; but he had not seen the respectable text of Dandolo, nor 
did he enough consider the topography of the harbour. The south-east 
would have been a more effectual wind. [Note to Wilken, voL v. p. 215.] 

M Quatre cens mil homes ou plus ( Villehardouin, No. 133) must be under- 
stood of men of a military age. Le Beau (Hist du Bas Empire, torn. xx. 
p. 417) allows Constantinople a million of inhabitants, of whom 60,000 
horse, and an infinite number of foot soldiers. In its present decay, the 
capital of the Ottoman empire may contain 400,000 souls (Bell's Travels, 
vol. ii. p. 401, 402); but as the Turks keep no registers, and as circum- 
stances are fallacious, it is impossible to ascertain (Niebuhr, Voyage en 
Arabic, torn. i. p. 18, 19) the real populousness of their cities. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 527 

enough trusted their lives and fortunes to a frail bark and a pre- 
carious element, and loudly demanded a trial of knighthood, a firm 
ground, and a close onset, either on foot or horseback. After a pru- 
dent compromise of employing the two nations by sea and land in the 
service best suited to their character, the fleet covering the army, they 
both proceeded from the entrance to the extremity of the harbour: the 
stone bridge of the river was hastily repaired; and the six battles of 
the French formed their encampment against the front of the capital, 
the basis of the triangle which runs about four miles from the port to 
the Propontis. 65 On the edge of a broad ditch, at the foot of a lofty 
rampart, they had leisure to contemplate the difficulties of their enter- 
prise. The gates to the right and left of their narrow camp poured forth 
frequent sallies of cavalry and light infantry, which cut off their strag- 
glers, swept the country of provisions, sounded the alarm five or six 
times in the course of each day, and compelled them to plant a palisade 
and sink an entrenchment for their immediate safety. In the supplies 
and convoys the Venetians had been too sparing, or the Franks too vora- 
cious: the usual complaints of hunger and scarcity were heard, and per- 
haps felt: their stock of flour would be exhausted in three weeks; and 
their disgust of salt meat tempted them to taste the flesh of their horses. 
The trembling usurper was supported by Theodore Lascaris, his son- 
in-law, a valiant youth, who aspired to save and to rule his country; the 
Greeks, regardless of that country, were awakened to the defence of 
their religion; but their firmest hope was in the strength and spirit of 
the Varangian guards, of the Danes and English, as they are named 
in the writers of the times.* 6 After ten days' incessant labour the 
ground was levelled, the ditch filled, the approaches of the besiegers 
were regularly made, and two hundred and fifty engines of assault 
exercised their various powers to dear the rampart, to batter the walls, 
and to sap the foundations. On the first appearance of a breach the 
scaling-ladders were applied: the numbers that defended the vantage- 
ground repulsed and oppressed the adventurous Latins: but they ad- 
mired the resolution of fifteen knights and serjeants, who had gained the 
ascent, and maintained their: perilous station till they were precipitated 
or made prisoners by the Imperial guards. On the side of the harbour 
the naval attack was more successfully conducted by the Venetians; 
and that industrious people employed every resource that was known 
and practised before the invention of gunpowder. A double line, three 
bow-shots in front, was formed by the galleys and ships; and the swift 
motion of the former was supported by the weight and loftiness of the 

* On the most correct plans of Constantinople, I know not how to measure 
more than 4000 paces. Yet Villehardouin computes the space at three 
leagues (No. 86). If his eye were not deceived, he must reckon by the 
old Gallic league of 1500 paces, which might still be used in Champagne. 

"The guards, the Varangi, are styled by Villehardouin (No. 89, 95, etc.)

French pilgrim could not be mistaken in the nations of which they were at 
that time composed. 



528 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

latter, whose decks, and poops, and turret, was the platforms of mili- 
tary engines, that discharged their shot over the heads of the first line. 
The soldiers, who leaped from the galleys on shore, immediately planted 
and ascended their scaling-ladders, while the large ships, advancing 
more slowly into the intervals, and lowering a draw-bridge, opened a 
way through the air from their masts to the rampart. In the midst of 
the conflict the doge, a venerable and conspicuous form, stood aloft in 
complete armour on the prow of his galley. The great standard of St. 
Mark was displayed before him; his threats, promises, and exhortations 
urged the diligence of the rowers; his vessel was the first that struck; 
and Dandolo was the first warrior on the shore. The nations admired the 
magnanimity of the blind old man, without reflecting that his age and 
infirmities diminished the price of life and enhanced the value of im- 
mortal glory. On a sudden, by an invisible hand (for the standard- 
bearer was probably slain), the banner of the republic was fixed on the 
rampart: twenty-five towers were rapidly occupied; and, by the cruel 
expedient of fire, the Greeks were driven from the adjacent quarter. 
The doge had despatched the intelligence of his success, when he was 
checked by the danger of his confederates. Nobly declaring that he 
would rather die with the pilgrims than gain a victory by their destruc- 
tion, Dandolo relinquished his advantage, recalled his troops, and has- 
tened to the scene of action. He found the six weary diminutive battles 
of the French encompassed by sixty squadrons of the Greek cavalry, 
the least of which was more numerous than the largest of their divi- 
sions. Shame and despair had provoked Alexius to the last effort of a 
general sally; but he was awed by the firm order and manly aspect of 
the Latins; and, after skirmishing at a distance, withdrew his troops in 
the close of the evening. The silence or tumult of the night exasperated 
his fears; and the timid usurper, collecting a treasure of ten thousand 
pounds of gold, basely deserted his wife, his people, and his fortune; 
threw himself into a bark; stole through the Bosphorus; and landed in 
shameful safety in an obscure harbour of Thrace. As soon as they were 
apprised of his flight, the Greek nobles sought pardon and peace in the 
dungeon where the blind Isaac expected. each hour the visit of the 
executioner. Again saved and exalted by the vicissitudes of fortune, 
the captive in his Imperial robes was replaced on the throne, and sur- 
rounded with prostrate slaves, whose real terror and affected joy he was 
incapable of discerning. At the dawn of day hostilities were suspended 
and the Latin chiefs were surprised by a message from the lawful and 
reigning emperor, who was impatient to embrace his son and to reward 
his generous deliverers. 67 

" For the first siege and conquest of Constantinople, we may read the 
original letter of the crusaders to Innocent III., Gesta, c. 91, p. 533, 534; 
Villehardouin, No. 75-99; Nicetas, in Alexio Comnen. 1. iii. c. 10, p. 349-352 
[p. 718-725, ed. Bonn] ; Dandolo, in Chron. p. 322. Gunther and his abbot 
Martin were not yet returned from their obstinate pilgrimage to Jerusalem, 
or St. John d'Acre, where the greatest part of the company had died of 
the plague. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE Sag 

But these generous deliverers were unwilling to release their hostage 
till they had obtained from his father the payment, or at least the prom- 
ise, of their recompense. They chose four ambassadors, Matthew of 
Montmorency, our historian the marshal of Champagne, and two Vene- 
tians, to congratulate the emperor. The gates were thrown open on 
their approach, the streets on both sides were lined with the battle-axes 
of the Danish and English guard: the presence-chamber glittered with 
gold and jewels, the false substitutes of virtue and power: by the side 
of the blind Isaac his wife was seated, the sister of the king of Hungary: 
and by her appearance, the noble matrons of Greece were drawn from 
their domestic retirement and mingled with the circle of senators and 
soldiers. The Latins, by the mouth of the marshal, spoke like men 
conscious of their merits, but who respected the work of their own 
hands; and the emperor dearly understood that his son's engagements 
with Venice and the pilgrims must be ratified without hesitation or 
delay. Withdrawing into a private chamber with the empress, a cham- 
berlain, an interpreter, and the four ambassadors, the father of young 
Alexius inquired with some anxiety into the nature of his stipulations. 
The submission of the Eastern empire to the pope, the succour of the 
Holy Land, and a present contribution of two hundred thousand marks 
of silver. " These conditions are weighty," was his prudent reply: 
" they are hard to accept, and difficult to perform. But no conditions 
can exceed the measure of your services and deserts." After this satis- 
factory assurance, the barons mounted on horseback and introduced 
the heir of Constantinople to the city and palace: his youth and mar- 
vellous adventures engaged every heart in his favour, and Alexius was 
solemnly crowned with his father in the dome of St. Sophia. In the 
first days of his reign, the people, already blessed with the restoration 
of plenty and peace, was delighted by the joyful catastrophe of the 
tragedy; and the discontent of the nobles, their regret, and their fears, 
were covered by the polished surface of pleasure and loyalty. The mix- 
ture of two discordant nations in the same capital might have been preg- 
nant with mischief and danger; and the suburb of Galata, or Pera, was 
assigned for the quarters of the French and Venetians. But the liberty 
of trade and familiar intercourse was allowed between the friendly 
nations; and each day the pilgrims were tempted by devotion or 
curiosity to visit the churches and palaces of Constantinople. Their 
rude minds, insensible perhaps of the finer arts, were astonished by the 
magnificent scenery: and the poverty of their native towns enhanced 
the populousness and riches of the first metropolis of Christendom. 68 
Descending from his state, young Alexius was prompted by interest and 
gratitude to repeat his frequent and familiar visits to his Latin allies; 

"Compare, in the rude energy of Villehardoum (No. 66, 100), the inside 
and outside views of Constantinople, and their impression on the minds ot" 
the pilgrims: cette ville (says he) que de totes les autres ere souveraine.

530 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

and in the freedom of the table the gay petulance of the French some* 
times forgot the emperor of the East. 69 In their more serious confer- 
ences it was agreed that the re-union of the two churches must be the 
result of patience and time; but avarice was less tractable than zeal; 
and a large sum was instantly disbursed to appease the wants, and 
silence the importunity, of the crusaders. 70 Alexius was alarmed by 
the approaching hour of their departure: their absence might have re- 
lieved him from the engagement which he was yet incapable of perform- 
ing; but his friends would have left him, naked and alone, to the 
caprice and prejudice of a perfidious nation. He wished to bribe their 
stay, the delay of a year, by undertaking to defray their expense, and 
to satisfy, in their name, the freight of the Venetian vessels. The offer 
was agitated in the council of the barons; and, after a repetition of 
their debates and scruples, a majority of votes again acquiesced in lie 
advice of the doge and the prayer of the young emperor. At the price 
of sixteen hundred pounds of gold, he prevailed on the marquis of 
Montferrat to lead him with an army round the provinces of Europe; 
to establish his authority, and pursue his uncle, while Constantinople 
was awed by the presence of Baldwin and his confederates of France 
and Flanders. The expedition was successful: the blind emperor ex- 
ulted in the success of his arms, and listened to the predictions of his 
flatterers, that the same Providence which had raised him from the 
dungeon to the throne would heal his gout, restore his sight, and watch 
over the long prosperity of his reign. Yet the mind of the suspicious 
old man was tormented by the rising glories of his son; nor could his 
pride conceal from his envy, that, while his own name was pronounced 
in faint and reluctant acclamations, the royal youth was the theme of 
spontaneous and universal praise. 71 

By the recent invasion the Greeks were awakened from a dream of 
nine centuries; from the vain presumption that the capital of the Roman 
empire was impregnable to foreign arms. The strangers of the West 
had violated the city, and bestowed the sceptre, of Constantine: their 
Imperial clients soon became as unpopular as themselves: the well- 
known vices of Isaac were rendered still more contemptible by his in- 
firmities, and the young Alexius was hated as an apostate who had re- 
nounced the manners and religion of his country. His secret covenant

with the Latins was divulged or suspected; the people, and especially 
the clergy, were devoutly attached to their faith and superstition; and 
every convent, and every shop, resounded with the danger of the church 
and the tyranny of the pope. 72 An empty treasury could ill supply 
the demands of regal luxury and foreign extortion: the Greeks refused 
to avert, by a general tax, the impending evils of servitude and pillage; 
the oppression of the rich excited a more dangerous and personal re- 
sentment; and if the emperor melted the plate and despoiled the images 



Constantinople was visited with a calamity which might be justly im- 
puted to the zeal and indiscretion of the Flemish pilgrims. 73 In one of 
their visits to the city they were scandalised by tlie aspect of a mosque 
or synagogue, in which one God was worshipped, without a partner or 
a^son, .Their effectual mode of controversy was to attack the infidels 
with the sword, and their habitation with fire: but the infidels, and some 
Christian neighbours, presumed to defend their lives and properties; 
and the flames which bigotry had kindled consumed the most orthodox 
and innocent structures. During eight days and nights the conflagration 
spread above a league in fronf, from the harbour to the Propontis, 
over the thickest and most populous regions of the city. It is not easy 
to count the stately churches and palaces that were reduced to a smok- 
ing ruin, to value the merchandise that perished in the trading streets, 
or to number the families that were involved in the common destruc- 
tion^ By this outrage, which the doge and the barons in vain affected 
to disclaim, the name of the Latins became still more unpopular; and 
the colony of that nation, above fifteen thousand persons, consulted 
their safety in a hasty retreat from the city to the protection of their 
standard in the suburb of Pera. The emperor returned in triumph; 
but the firmest and most dexterous policy would have been insufficient 
to steer him through the tempest which overwhelmed the person and 
government of that unhappy youth. His own inclination, and his 
father's advice, attached him to his benefactors; but Alexius hesitated 
between gratitude and patriotism, between the fear of his subjects and 
of his allies. 7 * By his feeble and fluctuating conduct he lost the esteem

533 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

and confidence of both; and, while he invited the marquis of Montferrat 
to occupy the palace, he suffered the nobles to conspire, and the people 
to arm, for the deliverance of their country. Regardless of his painful 
situation, the Latin chiefs repeated their demands, resented his delays, 
suspected his intentions, and exacted a decisive answer of peace or war. 
The haughty summons was delivered by three French knights and three 
Venetian deputies, who girded their swords, mounted their horses, 
pierced through the angry multitude, and entered, with a fearless coun- 
tenance, the palace and presence of the Greek emperor. In a peremp- 
tory tone they recapitulated their services and his engagements; and 
boldly declared that, unless their just claims were fully and immediately 
satisfied, they should no longer hold him either as a sovereign or a 
friend. After this defiance, the first that had ever wounded an Imperial 
ear, they departed without betraying any symptoms of fear; but their 
escape from a servile palace and a furious city astonished the ambassa- 
dors themselves: and their return to the camp was the signal of mutual 
hostility. 

Among the Greeks all authority and wisdom were overborne by the 
impetuous multitude, who mistook their rage for valour, their numbers 
for strength,- and their fanaticism for the support and inspiration of 
Heaven. In the eyes of both nations Alexius was false and contempt- 
ible: the base and spurious race of the Angeli was rejected with clam- 
orous disdain; and the people of Constantinople encompassed the senate 
to demand at their hands a more worthy emperor. To every sen- 
ator, conspicuous by his birth or dignity, they- successively presented 
the purple: by each senator the deadly garment was repulsed: the con- 
test lasted three days; and we may learn from the historian Nicetas, 
one of the members of the assembly, that fear and weakness were the 
guardians of their loyalty. A phantom, who vanished in oblivion, was 
forcibly proclaimed by the crowd: 75 but the author of the tumult, and 
the leader of the war, was a prince of the house of Ducas; and his com- 
mon appellation of Alexius must be discriminated by the epithet of 
Mourzoufle, 70 which in the vulgar idiom expressed the close junction 
of his black and shaggy eyebrows. At once a patriot and a courtier, the 
perfidious Mourzoufle, who was not destitute of cunning and courage, 
opposed the Latins both in speech and action, inflamed the passions 
and prejudices of the Greeks, and insinuated himself into the favour 
and confidence of Alexius, who trusted him with the office of great 
chamberlain, and tinged his buskins with the colours of royalty. At 
the dead of night he rushed into the bed-chamber with an affrighted 
aspect, exclaiming that the palace was attacked by the people and be- 

75 His name was Nicholas Canabus: he deserved the praise of Nicetas and 
the vengeance of Mourzoufle (p. 362 [p. 744 ed. Bonn]). 

"Villehardouin (No. 116) speaks of him as a favourite, without knowing 
that he was a prince of the blood, Angelas and Ducas. Ducange, who pries 
into every corner, believes him to be the son of Isaac Ducas Sebastocrator, 
and second cousin of young Alexius. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 533 

trayed by the guards. Starting from his couch, the unsuspecting prince 
threw himself into the arms of his enemy, who had contrived his escape 
by a private staircase. But that staircase terminated in a prison: 
Alexius was seized, stripped, and loaded with chains; and, after tasting 
some days the bitterness of death, he was poisoned, or strangled, or 
beaten with clubs, at the command, and in the presence, of the tyrant. 
The emperor Isaac Angelus soon followed his son to the grave; and 
Mourzoufle, perhaps, might spare the superfluous crime of hastening 
the extinction of impotence and blindness. 

The death of the emperors, and the usurpation of Mourzoufle, had 
changed the nature of the quarrel. It was no longer the disagreement 
of allies who overvalued their services, or neglected their obligations: 
the French and Venetians forgot their complaints against Alexius, 
dropped a tear on the untimely fate of their companion, and swore re- 
venge against the perfidious nation who had crowned his assassin. Yet 
the prudent doge was still inclined to negotiate: he asked as a debt, a 
subsidy, or a fine, fifty thousand pounds of gold, about two millions 
sterling; nor would the conference have been abruptly broken if the 
zeal, or policy, of Mourzoufle had not refused to sacrifice the Greek 
church to the safety of the state." Amidst the invectives of his foreign 
and domestic enemies, we may discern that he was not unworthy of the 
character which he had assumed, of the public champion: the second 
siege of Constantinople was far more laborious than the first; the treas- 
ury was replenished, and discipline was restored, by a severe inquisition 
into the abuses of the former reign; and Mourzoufle, an iron mace in 
his hand, visiting the posts, and affecting the port and aspect of a war- 
rior, was an object of terror to his soldiers, at least, and to his kins- 
men. Before and after the death of Alexius, the Greeks made two vig- 
orous and well-conducted attempts to burn the navy hi the harbour; 
but the skill and courage of the Venetians repulsed the fire-ships; and 
the vagrant flames wasted themselves without injury in the sea. 78 In 
a nocturnal sally the Greek emperor was vanquished by Henry, brother 
of the count of Flanders: the advantages of number and surprise ag- 
gravated the shame of his defeat: his buckler was found on the field 
of battle; and the Imperial standard, 79 a divine image of the Virgin, 
was presented, as a trophy and a relic, to the Cistercian monks, the 
disciples of St. Bernard. Near three months, without excepting the 
holy season of Lent, were consumed in skirmishes and preparations, 

"This negotiation, probable in itself, and attested by Nicetas (p. 365 
[p. 751, ed Bonn]), is omitted as scandalous by the delicacy of Dandolo 
and Villehardouin. 

"Baldwin mentions both attempts to fire the fleet (Gest. c. 92, p. 534, 535) ; 
Villehardouin (No. 113-115) only describes the first. It is remarkable that 
neither of these warriors observe any peculiar properties in the Greek fire. 

"Ducange (No. 119) pours forth a torrent of learning on the Gonfanon 
Imperial. This banner of the Virgin is shown at Venice as a trophy and 
relic: if it be genuine, the pious doge must have cheated the monks of 
Citeaux. 



534 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

before the Latins were ready or resolved for a general assault. The 
land fortifications had been found impregnable; and the Venetian 
pilots represented, that, on the shore of the Propontis, the anchorage 
was unsafe, and the ships must be driven by the current far away to the 
straits of the Hellespont; a prospect not unpleasing to the reluctant 
pilgrims, who sought every opportunity of breaking the army. From 
the harbour, therefore, the assault was determined by the assailants 
and expected by the besieged; and the emperor had placed his scarlet 
pavilions on a neighbouring height, to direct and animate the efforts of 
his troops. A fearless spectator, whose mind could entertain the ideas 
of pomp and pleasure, might have admired the long array of two em- 
battled armies, which extended above half a league, the one on the ships 
and galleys, the other on the walls and towers raised above the ordinary 
level by several stages of wooden turrets. Their first fury was spent 
in the discharge of darts, stones, and fire, from the engines; but the 
water was deep; the French were bold; the Venetians were skilful; 
they approached the walls; and a desperate conflict of swords, spears, 
and battle-axes, was fought on the trembling bridges that grappled the 
floating to the stable batteries. In more than a hundred places the 
assault was urged and the defence was sustained; till the superiority 
of ground and numbers finally prevailed, and the Latin trumpets sounded 
a retreat. On the ensuing days the attack was renewed with equal vigour 
and ^similar event; and, in the night, the doge and the barons held a 
council, apprehensive only for the public danger: not a voice pronounced 
the words of escape or treaty; and each warrior, according to his tem- 
per, embraced the hope of victory or the assurance of a glorious death. 80 
By the experience of the former siege the Greeks were instructed, but 
the Latins were animated; and the knowledge that Constantinople might 
be taken was of more avail than the local precautions which that knowl- 
edge had inspired for its defence. In the third assault two ships were 
linked together to double their strength; a strong north wind drove them 
on the shore; the bishops of Troyes and Soissons led the van; and the 
auspicious names of the Pilgrim and the Paradise resounded along the 
line. 81 The episcopal banners were displayed on the walls; a hundred 
marks of silver had been promised to the first adventurers; and if their 
reward was intercepted by death, their names have been immortalised 
by fame. Four towers were scaled; three gates were burst open; and 
the French knights, who might tremble on the waves, felt themselves 
invincible on horseback on the solid ground. Shall I relate that the 
thousands who guarded the emperor's person fled on the approach, and 
before the lance, of a single warrior? Their ignominious flight is at- 
tested by their countryman Nicetas: an army of phantoms marched with

the French hero, and he was magnified to a giant in the eyes of the 
Greeks. 82 While the fugitives deserted their posts and cast away their 
arms, the Latins entered the city under the banners of their leaders: the 
streets and gates opened for their passage; and either design or accident 
kindled a third conflagration, which consumed in a few hours the meas- 
ure of three of the largest cities of France. 83 In the close of evening 
the barons checked their troops and fortified their stations: they were 
awed by the extent and populousness of the capital, which might yet 
require the labour of a month, if the churches and palaces were con- 
scious of their internal strength. But in the morning a suppliant pro- 
cession, with crosses and images, announced the submission of the 
Greeks and deprecated the wrath of the conquerors: the usurper es- 
caped through the golden gate: the palaces of Blachernse and Bouco- 
leon were occupied by the count of Flanders and the marquis of Mont- 
ferrat; and the empire, which still bore the name of Constantine and 
the title of Roman, was subverted by the arms of the Latin pilgrims. 84 

Constantinople had been taken by storm; and no restraints except 
those of religion and humanity were imposed on the conquerors by the 
laws of war. Boniface, marquis of Montferrat, still acted as their gen- 
eral; and the Greeks, who revered his name as that of their future SOY* 
ereign, were heard to exdaim in a lamentable tone, u Holy marquis- 
king, have mercy upon us! " His prudence or compassion opened the 
gates of the city to the fugitives, and he exhorted the soldiers of the 
cross to spare the lives of their fellow-Christians. The streams of blood 
that flow down the pages of Nicetas may be reduced to the slaughter of 
two thousand of his unresisting countrymen; 83 and the greater part was 
massacred, not by the strangers, but by the Latins who had been driven 
from the city, and who exercised the revenge of a triumphant faction, 
Yet of these exiles, some were less mindful of injuries th^n of benefits; 
and Nicetas himself was indebted for Lis safety to the generosity of a 

88 With an allusion to Homer, Nicetas calls him &amp;ve6pyvu&gt;s, nine orgyae, or 
eighteen yards, high a stature which would, indeed, have excused the 
terror of the Greek. On this occasion the historian seems fonder of the 
marvellous than of his country, or perhaps of truth. Baldwin exclaims, in 
the words of the psalmist, persequitur unus ex nobis centum alienos. 

"Villehardouin (No. 130) is again ignorant of the authors of this more

Venetian merchant. Pope Innocent the Third accuses the pilgrims of re- 
specting, in their lust, neither age, nor sex, nor religious profession; and 
bitterly laments that the deeds of darkness, fornication, adultery, and 
incest, were perpetrated in open day; and that noble matrons and holy 
nuns were polluted by the grooms and peasants of the Catholic camp. 80 
Tt is indeed probable that the licence of victory prompted and covered 
a multitude of sins: but it is certain that the capital of the East con- 
tained a stock of venal or willing beauty sufficient to satiate the desires 
of twenty thousand pilgrims, and female prisoners were no longer sub- 
ject to tibe right or abuse of domestic slavery. The marquis of Mont- 
ferrat was the patron of discipline and decency: the count of Flanders 
was the mirror of chastity: they had forbidden, under pain of death, 
the rape of married women, or virgins, or nuns; and the proclamation 
was sometimes invoked by the vanquished 8T and respected by the vic- 
tors. Their cruelty and lust were moderated by the authority of the 
chiefs and feelings of the soldiers; for we are no longer describing an 
irruption of the northern savages; and however ferocious they might 
still appear, time, policy, and religion had civilised the manners of the 
French, and still more of the Italians. But a free scope was allowed to 
their avarice, which was glutted, even in the holy week, by the pillage 
of Constantinople. The right of victory, unshackled by any promise or 
treaty, had confiscated the public and private wealth of the Greeks; 
and every hand, according to its size and strength, might lawfully exe- 
cute the sentence and seize the forfeiture. A portable and universal 
standard of exchange was found in the coined and uncoined metals of 
gold and silver, which each captor, at home or abroad, might convert 
into the possessions most suitable to his temper and situation. Of the 
treasures which trade and luxury had accumulated, the silks, velvets, 
furs, the gems, spices, and rich movables, were the most precious, as they 
could not be procured for money in the ruder countries of Europe. An 
order of rapine was instituted; nor was the share of each individual 
abandoned to industry or chance. Under the tremendous penalties of 
perjury excommunication and death the Latins were bound to de- 
liver their plunder into the common stock; three churches were selected 
for the deposit and distribution of the spoil: a single share was allotted 
to a foot soldier, two for a Serjeant on horseback, four to a knight, and 
larger proportions according to the rank and merit of the barons and 
princes. For violating this sacred engagement, a knight belonging to the 
count of St. Paul was hanged with his shield and coat of arms around 
his neck: his example might render similar offenders more artful and 

"Quidam (says Innocent III., Gesta, c. 94, p. 538) nee religion!, nee

et virgines Deoque dicatas, exposuerunt spurcitiis garcionum. Villenardouin 
takes no notice of these common incidents.

discreet, but avarice was more powerful than fear, and it is generally 
believed that the secret far exceeded the acknowledged plunder. Yet 
the magnitude of the prize surpassed the largest scale of experience 
or expectation. 88 After the whole had been equally divided between 
the French and Venetians, fifty thousand marks were deducted to sat- 
isfy the debts of the former and the demands of the latter. The 
residue of the French amounted to four hundred thousand marks of sil- 
ver, 89 about eight hundred thousand pounds sterling; nor can I better 
appreciate the value of that sum in the public and private transactions 
of the age than by defining it as seven times the animal revenue of the 
kingdom of England. 90 

In this great revolution we enjoy the singular felicity of comparing 
the narratives of Villehardouin and Nicetas, the opposite feelings of the 
marshal of Champagne and the Byzantine senator. 91 At the first view 
it should seem that the wealth of Constantinople was only transferred 
from one nation to another, and that the loss and sorrow of the Greeks 
is exactly balanced by the joy and advantage of the Latins. But in the 
miserable account of war the gain is never equivalent to the loss, the 
pleasure to the pain; the smiles of the Latins were transient and falla- 
cious; the Greeks for ever wept over the ruins of their country, and 
their real calamities were aggravated by sacrilege and mockery. What 
benefits accrued to the conquerors from the three fires which annihilated 
so vast a portion of the buildings and riches of the city? What a stock 
of such things as could neither be used nor transported was maliciously 
or wantonly destroyed! How much treasure was idly wasted in gaming, 
debauchery, and riot! And what precious objects were bartered for a 
vile price by the impatience or ignorance of the soldiers, whose reward 
was stolen by the base industry of the last of the Greeks! These alone 
who had nothing to lose might derive some profit from the revolution; 
but the misery of the upper ranks of society is strongly painted in the 
personal adventures of Nicetas himself. His stately palace had been 
reduced to ashes in the second conflagration; and the senator, with his 

"Of the general mass of wealth, Gunther observes, ut de pauperibus et 
advenis cives ditissimi redderentur (Hist. C. P. c. 18) ; Villehardouin (No, 
132), that since the creation, ne fu tant gaaignie en une ville; Baldwin (Gesta, 
c. 92), ut tantum tota non videatur possidere Latinitas [p. 535]. 

88 Villehardouin, No. 133-135. Instead of 400,000, there is a various reading 
of 500,000. The Venetians had offered to take the whole booty, and to give 
400 marks to each knight, 200 to each priest and horseman, and 100 to each 
foot soldier: they would have been great losers (Le Beau, Hist, du Bas- 
Empire, torn. xx. p. 506: I know not from whence). 

90 At the council of Lyons (AJX 1245) the English ambassadors stated the 
revenue of the crown as below that of the foreign clergy, which amounted 
to 60,000 marks a-year (Matthew Paris, p. 451 ; Hume's History of England, 
vol. ii. p. 170). 

"The disorders of the sack of Constantinople, and his own adventures, 
are feelingly described by Nicetas, p. 367-369 [p. 757-761, ed. Bonn], and in

of sacrilege, are justified by Innocent III. (Gesta, c. 92) ; but Villehardouin

family and friends, found an obscure shelter in another house which he 
possessed near the church of St. Sophia, It was the door of this mean 
habitation that his friend the Venetian merchant guarded^ in the dis- 
guise of a soldier, till Nicetas could save by a precipitate flight the 
relics of his fortune and the chastity of his- daughter. In a cold wintry 
season these fugitives, nursed in the lap of prosperity, departed on foot; 
his- wife was with child; the desertion of their slaves compelled them 
to carry their baggage on their own shoulders;' and their women, whom 
they placed in the centre, were exhorted to conceal their beauty with 
dirt, instead of adorning it with paint and jewels. Every step was ex- 
posed to insult and danger: the threats of the strangers were less pain- 
ful than the taunts of the plebeians, with whom they were now levelled; 
nor did the exiles breathe in safety till their mournful pilgrimage was 
concluded at Selymbria, above forty miles from the capital. On the 
way they overtook the patriarch, without attendance and almost with- 
out apparel, riding on afc ass, and reduced to- a State of apostolical pov- 
erty, which, had it been voluntary, might perhaps have been meritori- 
ous. In the meanwhile his desolate churches were profaned by the 
licentiousness and party zeal of the Latins* After stripping the gems 
and pearls, they converted the chalkes into diinking-cups; their tables, 
on which they j;anied and- feasted, were covered with the pictures of 
Christ and the saints; and they ttarupled under foot the most vener- 
able objects* of the Christian, worship. In the cathedral of St. Sophia 
the ample veil df the sanctuary was rent asunder for the sake of the 
golden fringe; and the altar, a monument of art and riches, was broken 
in pieces and shared among the captors^ Their mules and horses were 
laden with the wrought silver and gilt carvings which they tore down 
from the doors and pulpit; and if the beasts stumbled under the bur- 
den, they were stabbed by their impatient drivers, and the holy pave- 
ment streamed with their impure blood. A prostitute was seated on the 
throne of the patriarch; and that daughter of. Belial, as she is styled, 
sung and danced in the church to ridicule the hymns and processions of 
the Orientals. Nor were the repositories of the royal dead secure from 
violation: in the church of the Apostles the tombs of the emperors were 
rifled;, and it is said that after six centuries the Corpse of Justinian was 
found without any signs of decay or putrefaction. In the streets the 
French and Flemings clothed themselves and their' horses in painted 
robes and flowing head-dresses of linen;, and the coarse intemperance of 
their feasts w insulted the splendid sobriety of the East. To expose 
the arms of a people of scribes and scholars, they affected to 1 display a 
pen, an inkhorn, and a sheet of paper, without discerning- 1 that the in- 
struments of science afid valour were dike feeble and useless in the 
hands of the modern Greeks. 
Their reputation and their language encouraged them, however, to

dishes were" boiled buttocks of beef, salt pork and peas-, and soup- made of 
garlic and sharp or sour herbs (p. 382- [p. 786. ed. Bonn]), 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 539 

despise the ignorance and to overlook the progress of the Latins. 93 Irt 
the love of the arts the national difference was still more obvious and 
real; the Greeks preserved with reverence the works of their ancestors, 
which they could not imitate; and, in the destruction of the statues of 
Constantinople, we are provoked to join in the complaints and invec- 
tives of the Byzantine historian. 84 We have seen how the rising city 
was adorned by the vanity and despotism of the Imperial founder: in 
the ruins of paganism some gods and heroes were saved from the axe of 
superstition; and the forum and hippodrome were dignified with the 
relics of a better age. Several of these are described by Nicetas * 5 in a 
florid and affected style; and from his descriptions I shall select some- 
interesting particulars, i. The victorious charioteers were cast to 
bronze, at their own, or the public, charge, and fitly placed in the hippo- 
drome: they stood aloft in their chariots wheeling round the goal: thfc 
spectators could admire their attitude and judge of the resemblance; 
and of these figures, the most perfect might have been transported from 
the Olympic stadium. 2. The sphinx, river-horse, and crocodile, ^de- 
note the climate and manufacture of Egypt and the spoils of that ancient 
province. 3. The she-wolf suckling Romujus and Remus, a subject 
alike pleasing to the old and ihenew Romans, but which could rarely 
be treated before lie decline of the Greek sculpture. 4. An eagle hold- 
ing and tearing a serpent in his talons a domestic monument of the 
Byzantines, which they ascribed, not to a human artist, but to the magic 
power of the philosopher Apollonius, who, by this talisman, delivered 
the city from such venomous reptiles. 5. An ass and his driver, which 
were erected by Augustus in his colony of Nicopolis, to commemorate 
a verbal omen of the victory of Actium. 6. An equestrian statue, which 
passed in the vulgar opinion for Joshua, the Jewish conqueror, stretch- 
ing out his hand to stop the course of the descending sun. A more 
classical tradition recognised the figures of Bellerophon and Pegasus; 
,and the free attitude of the steed seemed to mark that he trod on air 
rather than on the earth. 7. A square and lofty obelisk of brass; the 
sides were embossed with a variety of picturesque and rural $cenes: 



* Nicetas uses very harsh expressions, Trap' dypafi/jidrois Bap/3dpow, teat 
r&amp;eov dvaX^ajSijrow (Fragment apud Fabric. Biblioth. Graec. torn. vi. p. 
414), This reproach, it is true, applies most strongly to their ignorance of 
Greek and of Homer. In their own language, the Latins of the twelfth and 
thirteenth centuries were not destitute of literature. See Harris's Philo- 
logical Inquiries, p. iii. c. 9, ID, n. 

* Nicetas was of Chonae in Phrygia (the old Colossae^of St. Paul): he 
raised himself to the honours of senator, judge of the veil, and great logo-. 
thete; beheld the fall of the empire, retired to Nice, and composed an 
elaborate history from the death of Alexius Comnenus to the reign of 
Henry. 

* B A manuscript of Nicetas in the Bodleian library contains this curious* 
fragment on the statues of Constantinople, which fraud, or shame, or rather 
carelessness, has dropped in the common editions. It is published by Fabricius- 
(Biblioth. Graec. torn. vi. p. 405-416), and immoderately praised by the late 
ingenious Mr. Hands of Salisbury (Philological Inquiries, p. iii. c. 5, p. 301* 
312).

birds singing, rustics labouring or playing on their pipes, sheep bleat- 
ing, lambs skipping, the sea, and a scene of fish and fishing, little naked 
Cupids laughing, playing, and pelting each other with apples, and 
on the summit a female figure turning with the slightest breath, and 
thence denominated the wind's attendant. 8. The Phrygian shepherd 
presenting to Venus the prize of beauty, the apple of discord. 9. The 
incomparable statue of Helen, which is delineated by Nicetas in the 
words of admiration and love: her well-turned feet, snowy arms, rosy 
lips, bewitching smiles, swimming eyes, arched eyebrows, the harmony 
of her shape, the lightness of her drapery, and her flowing locks that 
waved in the wind a beauty that might have moved her barbarian de- 
stroyers to pity and remorse. 10. The manly, or divine, form of Her- 
cules, 95 as he was restored to life by the master-hand of Lysippus, of 
such magnitude that his thumb was equal to the waist, his leg to the 
stature, of a common man: 9T his chest ample, his shoulders broad, his 
limbs strong and muscular, his hair curled, his aspect commanding. 
Without his bow, or quiver, or club, his lion's skin carelessly thrown 
over him, he was seated on an osier basket, his right leg and arm 
stretched to the utmost, his left knee bent and supporting his elbow, 
his head reclining on his left hand, his countenance indignant and pen- 
sive, n. A colossal statue of Juno, which had once adorned her temple 
of Samos; the enormous head by four yoke of oxen was kboriously 
drawn to the palace. 12. Another colossus, of Pallas or Minerva, thirty 
feet in height, and representing with admirable spirit the attributes and 
character of the martial maid. Before we accuse the Latins, it is just 
to remark that this Pallas was destroyed after the first siege by the 
fear and superstition of the Greeks themselves. 98 The other statues of 
brass which I have enumerated were broken and melted by the un- 
feeling avarice of the crusaders: the cost and labour were consumed 
in a moment; the soul of genius evaporated in smoke, and the rem- 
nant of base metal was coined into money for the payment of the troops. 
Bronze is not the most durable of monuments: from the marble forms 
of Phidias and Praxiteles the Latins might turn aside with stupid con- 
lempt; 99 but unless they were crushed by some accidental injury, those 

"To illustrate the statue of Hercules, Mr. Harris quotes a Greek epigram, 
and engraves a beautiful gem, which does not, however, copy the attitude 
of the statue: in the latter, Hercules had not his club, and his right leg 
and arm were extended. 

W I transcribe these proportions, which appear to me inconsistent with each 
other, and may possibly show that the boasted taste of Nicetas was no more 
than affectation and vanity. 

* Nicetas in Isaaco Angelo et Alexio, c, 3, p. 359 [p. 738, ed. Bonn]. The 
Latin editor very properly observes that the historian, in his bombast style, 
produces ex pulice elephantem.

Latins are branded with the lively reproach of ol roO icoXofl Avlpcurrot p&amp;p-

the merit of removing four bronze horses from Constantinople to the place of

useless stones stood secure on their pedestals. 100 The most enlightened 
of the strangers, above the gross and sensual pursuits of their country- 
men, more piously exercised the right of conquest in the search and 
seizure of the relics of the saints. 101 Immense was the supply of heads 
and bones, crosses and images, that were scattered by this revolution 
over the churches of Europe; and such was the increase of pilgrimage 
and oblation, that no branch, perhaps, of more lucrative plunder was 
imported from the East. 102 Of the writings of antiquity many that 
still existed in the twelfth century are now lost. But the pilgrims were 
not solicitous to save or transport the volumes of an unknown tongue: 
the perishable substance of paper or parchment can only be preserved 
by the multiplicity of copies; the literature of the Greeks had almost 
centered in the metropolis; and, without computing the extent of our 
loss, we may drop a tear over the libraries that have perished in the 
triple fire of Constantinople. 108

**I shall conclude this chapter with the notice of a modern history, which 
illustrates the taking of Constantinople by the Latins, but which has t fallen 
somewhat late into my hands. Paolo Ramusio, the son of the compiler of 
Voyages, was directed by the senate of Venice to write the history of ^ the 
conquest; and this order, which he received in his youth, he executed in a 
mature age, by an elegant Latin work, de Bello Constantmopolitano et Impera- 
toribus Comnenis per Gallos et Venetos restitutis (Venet. 1635, in folio). 
Ramusio, or Rhamnusus, transcribes and translates, sequitur ad unguem, B a 
MS. of Villehardouin, which he possessed; but he enriches his narrative with 
Greek and Latin materials, and we are indebted to him for a correct state of 
the fleet, the names of the fifty Venetian nobles who commanded the galleys 
of the republic, and the patriot opposition of Pantaleon Barbus to the choice 
of the doge for empero,r. rr . _ . , . .

emperor of the East; and that, if the votes were equal, the decision of 
chance should ascertain the successful candidate. To him, with all the 
titles and prerogatives of the Byzantine throne, they assigned the two 
palaces of Boucoleon and Blachernse, with a fourth part of the Greek 
monarchy. It was denned that the three remaining portions should be 
equally shared between the republic of Venice and the barons of France; 
that each feudatory, with an honourable exception for the doge, should 
acknowledge and perform the duties of homage and military service 
to the supreme head of the empire; that the nation which gave an em- 
peror should resign to their brethren the choice of a patriarch; and 
that the pilgrims, whatever might be their impatience to visit the Holy 
Land, should devote another year to the conquest and defence of the 
Greek provinces. After the conquest of Constantinople by the Latins, 
the treaty was confirmed and executed; and the first and most impor- 
tant step was the creation of an emperor. The six electors of the French 
nation were all ecclesiastics, the abbot of Loces, the archbishop elect of 
Acre in Palestine, and the bishops of Troyes, Soissons, Halberstadt, 
and Bethlehem, the last of whom exercised in the camp the office of 
pope's legate: their profession and knowledge were respectable; and as 
they could not be the objects, they were best qualified to be the authors, 
of the choice. The six Venetians were the principal servants of the state, 
and in this list the noble families of Querini and Contarini are still proud 
to discover their ancestors. The twelve assembled in tKe chapel of the 
palace; and after the solemn invocation of the Holy Ghost, they pro- 
ceeded to deliberate and vote. A just impulse of respect and gratitude 
prompted them to crown the virtues of the doge: his wisdom had in- 
spired their enterprise; and the most youthful knights might envy and 
applaud the exploits of blindness and age. But the patriot Dandolo was 
devoid of all personal ambition, and fully satisfied that he had been 
judged worthy to reign. His nomination was overruled by the Venetians 
themselves: his countrymen, and perhaps his friends, 2 represented, with 
the eloquence of truth, the mischiefs that might arise to national free- 
dom and the common cause from the union of two incompatible char- 
acters, of the first magistrate of a republic and the emperor of the East. 
The exclusion of the doge left room for the more equal merits of Boni- 
face and Baldwin; and at their names all meaner candidates respectfully 
withdrew. ^ The marquis of Montf errat was recommended by his mature 
age and fair reputation, by the choice of the adventurers, and the wishes 
of the Greeks; nor can I believe that Venice, the mistress of the sea, 
&lt;:ould be seriously apprehensive of a petty lord at the foot of the Alps. 8 

After mentioning the nomination of the doge by a French elector, his 
Icinsman Andrew Dandolo approves his exclusion, quidam Venetorum fidelis 
et nobilw senex, usus oratione satis probabili, etc. [p. 330], which has been 
embroidered by modern writers from Blondus to Le Beau.

But the count of Flanders was the chief of a wealthy and warlike 
people; he was valiant, pious, and chaste; in the prime of life, since he 
was only thirty-two years of age; a descendant of Charlemagne, a 
cousin of the king of France, and a compeer of the prelates and barons 
who had yielded with reluctance to the command of a foreigner^ With- 
out the chapel, these barons, with the doge and marquis at their head, 
expected the decision of the twelve electors. It was announced by the 
bishop of Soissons, in the name of his colleagues: " Ye have sworn to 
obey the prince whom we should choose: by our unanimous suffrage, 
Baldwin count of Flanders and Hainault is now your sovereign, and the 
emperor of the East." He was saluted with loud applause, and the proc- 
lamation was re-echoed through the city by the joy of the Latins and the 
trembling adulation of the Greeks. Boniface was the first to kiss the 
hand of his rival, and to raise him on the buckler; and Baldwin was 
transported to the cathedral, and solemnly invested with the purple 
buskins. At the end of three weeks he was crowned by the legate, in the 
vacancy of a patriarch; but the Venetian clergy soon filled the chapter 
of St. Sophia, seated Thomas Morosini on the ecclesiastical throne, and 
employed every art to perpetuate in their own nation the honours and 
benefices of the Greek church. 4 Without delay the successor of Con- 
stantine instructed Palestine, France, and Rome, of this memorable 
revolution. To Palestine he sent, as a trophy, the gates of Constanti- 
nople, and the chain of the harbour; 5 and adopted, from the Assise of 
Jerusalem, fche laws or customs best adapted to a French colony and con* 
quest in the East. In his epistles the natives of France are encouraged 
to swell that colony, and to secure that conquest, to people a magnificent 
city and a fertile land, which will reward the labours both of the priest 
and the soldier. He congratulates the Roman pontiff on the restora- 
tion of his authority in the East; invites him to extinguish the Greek 
schism by his presence in a general council; and implores his blessing 
and forgiveness for the disobedient pilgrims. Prudence and dignity are 
blended in the answer of Innocent. 6 In the subversion of the Byzantine 
empire, he arraigns the vices of man, and adores the providence of God: 
the conquerors will be absolved or condemned by their future conduct ^ 
the validity of their treaty depends on the .judgment of St. Peter; but 
he inculcates their most sacred duty of establishing a just subordination 
of obedience and tribute, from the Greeks to the Latins, from the mag- 
istrates to the clergy, and from the clergy to the pope. 

4 They exacted an oath from Thomas Morosini to appoint no canons of 
St Sophia the lawful electors, except Venetians who had lived ten years at 
Venice, etc. But the foreign clergy was envious, the pope disapproved this, 
national monopoly, and of the six Latin patriarchs of Constantinople only 
the first and the last were Venetians.

'The Epistles of Innocent III. are a rich fund for the ecclesiastical and 
civil institution of the Latin empire of Constantinople; and the most impor-

544 THE DECLINE AND FALI/OF 

In the division of the Greek provinces 7 the share of the Venetians 
was more ample than that of the Latin emperor. No more than one 
fourth was appropriated to his domain; a clear moiety of the remainder 
was reserved for Venice; and the other moiety was distributed among 
the adventurers of France and Lombardy. The venerable Dandolo was 
proclaimed despot of Romania, and invested after the Greek fashion 
with the purple buskins. He ended at Constantinople his long and glo- 
rious life; and if the prerogative was personal, the title was used by his 
successors till the middle of the fourteenth century, with the singular, 
though true, addition of lords of one fourth and a half of the Roman 
empire. 8 The doge, a slave of state, was seldom permitted to depart 
from the helm of the republic; but his place was supplied by the bail,. 
or regent, who exercised a supreme jurisdiction over the colony of Vene- 
tians: they possessed three of the eight quarters of the city; and his 
independent tribunal was composed of six judges, four counsellors, two 
chamberlains, two fiscal advocates, and a constable. The long experi- 
ence of the Eastern trade enabled them to select their portion with dis- 
cernment: they had rashly accepted the dominion and defence of Adrian- 
ople; but it was the more reasonable aim of their policy to form a 
"iain of factories, and cities, and islands, along the maritime coast, from 
the neighbourhood of Ragusa to the Hellespont and the Bosphorus. 
The labour and cost of such extensive conquests exhausted their treas- 
ury: they abandoned the maxims of government, adopted a feudal 
system, and contented themselves with the homage of their nobles 9 for 
the possessions which these private vassals undertook to reduce and 
maintain. And thus it was that the family of Sanut acquired the duchy 
of Naxos, which involved the greatest part of the archipelago. For the 
price of ten thousand marks the republic purchased of the marquis of 
Montferrat the fertile island uf Crete or Candia with the ruins of a hun- 
dred cities; 10 but its improvement was stinted by the proud and narrow 
spirit of an aristocracy; 11 and the wisest senators would confess that

cange, Histoire de C. P. i. 37- 

'Ducange (Hist de C. P. ii. 6) has marked the conquests made by the 
state or nobles of Venice of the islands of Candia, Corfu, Cephalonia, Zante, 
Naxos, Paros, Melos, Andros, Mycone, Scyro, Cea, and Lemnos. 

10 Boniface sold the isle of Candia, August 12, A.D. 1204. See the act in 
Sanuto, p. 533 : but I cannot understand how it could be his mother's portion, 
or how she could be the daughter of an emperor Alexius. 

n ln the year 1212 the doge Peter Zani sent a colony to Candia, drawn 
from every quarter of Venice. But in their savage manners and frequent 
rebellions the Candiots may be compared to the Corsicans under the yoke 
of Genoa; aotf when I compare the accounts of Belon and Tournefort, I 
cannot discern itiacb difference between the Venetian and the Turkish island.

the sea, not the land, was the treasury of St. Mark. In the moiety of 
the adventurers the marquis Boniface might claim the most liberal re- 
ward; and, besides the isle of Crete, his exclusion from the throne was 
compensated by the royal title and the provinces beyond the Hellespont. 
But he prudently exchanged that distant and difficult conquest for the 
kingdom of Thessalonica or Macedonia, twelve days' journey from the 
capital, where he might be supported by the neighbouring powers of his 
brother-in-law the king of Hungary. His progress was hailed by the 
voluntary or reluctant acclamations of the natives; and Greece, the 
proper and ancient Greece, again received a Latin conqueror, 12 who 
trod with indifference that classic ground. He viewed with a careless 
eye the beauties of the valley of Tempe; traversed with a cautious step 
the straits of Thermopylae; occupied the unknown cities of Thebes, 
Athens, and Argos; and assaulted the fortifications of Corinth and 
Napoli, 13 which resisted his arms. The lots of the Latin pilgrims were 
regulated by chance, or choice, or subsequent exchange; and they 
abused, with intemperate joy, their triumph over the lives and fortunes 
of a great people. After a minute survey of the provinces, they weighed 
in the scales of avarice the revenue of each district, the advantage of 
the situation, and the ample or scanty supplies for the maintenance of 
soldiers and horses. Their presumption claimed and divided the long- 
lost dependencies of the Roman sceptre: the Nile and Euphrates rolled 
through their imaginary realms; and happy was the warrior who drew 
for his prize the palace of the Turkish sultan of Iconium. 14 I shaE not 
descend to the pedigree of families and the rent-roll of estates, but I 
wish to specify that the counts of Blois and St. Pol were invested with 
the duchy of Nice and the lordship of Demotica: 15 the principal fiefs 
were held by the service of constable, chamberlain, cup-bearer, butler, 
and chief cook; and our historian, Jeffrey of Vfllehardouin, obtained a 
fair establishment on the banks of the Hebrus, and united the double 
office of marshal of Champagne and Romania. At the head of his 
knights and archers each baron mounted on horseback to secure the pos- 
session of his share, and their first efforts were generally successful. 

M Villehardouin (No. 159, 160, 173-177) and Nicetas (p. 387-394) describe 
the expedition into Greece of the marquis Boniface. The Choniate might 
derive his information from his brother Michael, archbishop of Athens, 
whom he paints as an orator, a statesman, and a saint His encomium of 
Athens, and the description of Tempe, should be published from the Bodleian 
MS. of Nicetas (Fabric. Biblioth. Grace, torn. vi. p. 405), and would have 
deserved Mr. Harris's inquiries. 

"Napoli di Romania, or Nauplia, the ancient seaport of Argos, is still a 
place of strength and consideration, situate on a rocky peninsula, with a 
good harbour (Chandler's Travels into Greece, p. 227). 

"I have softened the expression of Nicetas, who strives to expose the 
presumption of the Franks. See de Rebus C. P. expugnatam, p. 375-384. 

"A city surrounded by the river Hebrus, and six leagues to the south of 
Adrianople, received from its double wall the Greek name of Didymoteichos, 
insensibly corrupted into Demotica and Dimot. I have preferred the more 
convenient and modern appellation of Demotica. This place was the last 
Turkish residence of Charles XII. 



546 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

But the public force was weakened by their dispersion; and a thousand 
quarrels must arise under a law, and among men, whose sole umpire was 
the sword. Within three months after the conquest of Constantinople, 
the emperor and the king of Thessalonica drew their hostile followers 
into the field: they were reconciled by the authority of the doge, the 
advice of the marshal, and the firm freedom of their peers. 16 

Tro fugitives, who had reigned at Constantinople, still asserted the 
title of emperor; and the subjects of their fallen throne might be moved 
to pity by the misfortunes of the elder Alexius, or excited to revenge 
by the spirit of Mourzoufle. A domestic alliance, a common interest, 
a similar guilt, and the merit of extinguishing his enemies, a brother 
and a nephew, induced the more recent usurper to unite with the former 
the relics of his power. Mourzoufle was received with smiles and hon- 
ours in the camp of his father Alexius; but the wicked can never love, 
and should rarely trust, their fellow criminals: he was seized in the bath, 
deprived of his eyes, stripped of his troops and treasures, and turned 
out to wander an object of horror and contempt to those who with more 
propriety could hate, and with more justice could punish, the assassin 
of the emperor Isaac and his son. As the tyrant, pursued by fear or 
remorse, was stealing over to Asia, he was seized by the Latins of Con- 
stantinople, and condemned, after an open trial, to an ignominious 
death. His judges debated the mode of his execution,- the axe, the 
wheel, or the stake; and it was resolved that Mourzoufle 17 should as- 
cend the Theodosian column, a pillar of white marble of one hundred 
and forty-seven feet in height. 18 From the summit he was cast down 
headlong and dashed in pieces on the pavement, in the presence of in- 
uumerable spectators, who filled the forum of Taurus, and admired the 
accomplishment of an old prediction, which was explained by this sin- 

"Their quarrel is told by Villehardouin (No. 146-158) with the spirit of 
freedom. The merit and reputation of the marshal are acknowledged by

[William de Champlite, brother of the Count of Dijon, assumed the title 
of Prince of Achaia: on the death of his brother he returned with regret to 
France, to assume his paternal inheritance, and left Villehardouin his "bailli" 
on condition that, if he did not return within a year, Villehardouin was to 
retain the investiture. By an unknightly trick (as Milman says), Villehardouin 
disembarrassed himself from the troublesome claim of Robert, the cousin of 
the a count of Dijon, to the succession. He contrived that Robert should 
arrive just fifteen days too late; and with the general concurrence of the 
assembled knights was himself invested with the principality Q S 'r

Villehardouin (No. 141-145, 163), and Guntherus (c. 20, 21). Neither the 
marshal nor the monk afford a grain of pity for a tyrant or rebel, whose 
punishment, however, was more unexampled than his crime. 

The column of Arcadius, which represents in basso relievo his victories 
or those of his father Theodosius, is still extant at Constantinople. , It is

gular event. 19 The fate of Alexius is less tragical: he was sent by the 
marquis a captive to Italy, and a gift to the king of the Romans; but he 
had not much to applaud his fortune if the sentence of imprisonment 
and exile were changed from a fortress in the Alps to a monastery ii; 
Asia. But his daughter, before the national calamity, had been given 
in marriage to a young hero, who continued the succession, and restored 
the throne, of the Greek princes. 20 The valour of Theodore Lascaris 
was signalised in the two sieges of Constantinople. After the flight ,of 
Mourzoufle, when the Latins were already in the city, he offered him- 
self as their emperor to the soldiers and people; and his ambition, which 
might be virtuous, was undoubtedly brave. Could he have infused a 
soul into the multitude, they might have crushed the strangers under 
their feet: their abject despair refused his aid; and Theodore retired to 
breathe the air of freedom in Anatolia, beyond the immediate view and 
pursuit of the conquerors. Under the title, at first of despot, and after- 
wards of emperor, he drew to his standard the bolder spirits, who were 
fortified against slavery by the contempt of life; and, as every meam 
was lawful for the public safety, implored without scruple the alliance 
of the Turkish sultan. Nice, where Theodore established his residence, 
Prusa and Philadelphia, Smyrna and Ephesus, opened their gates^ to 
their deliverer: he derived strength and reputation from his victories, 
and even from his defeats; and the successor of Constantine preserved 
a fragment of the empire from the banks of the Maeander to the suburbs 
of Nicomedia, and at length of Constantinople. Another portion, dis- 
tant and obscure, was possessed by the lineal heir of the Comneni, a son 
of the virtuous Manuel, a grandson of the tyrant Andronicus. His name 
was Alexius; and the epithet of great was applied perhaps to his stature, 
rather than to his exploits. By the indulgence of the Angeli, he wa? 
appointed governor or duke of Trebizond: 21 his birth gave him ambi 

*&gt;The nonsense of Gunther and the modern Greeks concerning this column* 
fatidica is unworthy of notice ;' but it is singular enough, that, fifty years 
before the Latin conquest, the poet Tzetzes (Chiliad, ix. 277) relates th* 
dream of a matron, who saw an army in the forum, and a man sitting 
on the column, clapping his hands and uttering a loud exclamation. 

^The dynasties of Nice, Trebizond, and Epirus (of which Nicetas saw 
the origin without much pleasure or hope), are learnedly explored, and 
clearly represented, in the Familiae Byzantinae of Ducange. 

a Except some facts in Pachymer and Nicephorus Gregoras, which wjll 
hereafter be used, the Byzantine writers disdain to speak of the empire of! 
Trebizond, or principality of the Lasi; and among the Latins it is con* 
spicuous only in the romances of the fourteenth or fifteenth centuries. 
Yet the indefatigable Ducange has dug out (Fam. Byz. p. 192) two authentic 
passages in Vincent of Beauvais (1. xxxi. c. 144), and the protonotary 
Ogerius (apud Wading, A.D. 1270, No. 4). ' . . ' , . . 1 . 

[Alexius was not appointed governor of Trebizond by the indulgence of 
the Angeli: it was rather through the help of his aunt, queen Thamar of 
Iberia. When Andronicus died in 1185, his two grandsons, Alexius and 
David, succeeded in escaping to Iberia. Thamar helped Alexius to found, 
in 1204, the independent principality of Trapezus, where he assumed Ihe 
title of Grand Komnenos. At the same time his brother seized Paph- 
lagonia, Theodore Lascaris went against David, defeated him (1212), .and

tion, the revolution independence; and without changing his title, he 
reigned in peace from Sinope to the Phasis, along the coast of the Black 
Sea. His nameless son and successor is described as the vassal of the 
sultan, whom he served with two hundred lances: that Comnenian prince 
was no more than duke of Trebizond, and the title of emperor was first 
assumed by the pride and envy of the grandson of Alexius. In the West 
a third fragment was saved from the common shipweck by Michael, a 
bastard of the house of Angeli, who, before the revolution, had been 
known as an hostage, a soldier, and a rebel. His flight from the camp 
of the marquis Boniface secured his freedom; by his marriage with the 
governor's daughter he commanded the important place of Durazzo, 
assumed the title of despot, and founded a strong and conspicuous prin- 
cipality in Epirus, Jftolia, and Thessaly, which have ever been peopled 
by a warlike race. The Greeks, who had offered their service to their 
new sovereigns, were excluded by the haughty Latins 22 from all civil 
and military honours, as a nation born to tremble and obey. Their 
resentment prompted them to show that they might have been useful 
friends, since they could be dangerous enemies: their nerves were braced 
by adversity: whatever was learned or holy, whatever was noble or 
valiant, rolled away into the independent states of Trebizond, Epirus, 
and Nice; and a single patrician is marked by the ambiguous praise 
of attachment and loyalty to the Franks. The vulgar herd of the cities 
and the country would have gladly submitted to a mild and regular 
servitude; and the transient disorders of war would have been obliter- 
ated by some years of industry and peace. But peace was banished, 
and industry was crushed, in the disorders of the feudal system. The 
Roman emperors of Constantinople, if they were endowed with abilities, 
were armed with power for the protection of their subjects: their laws 
were wise, and their administration was simple. The Latin throne was 
filled by a titular prince, the chief, and often the servant, of his licen- 
tious confederates: the fiefs of the empire, from a kingdom to a castle, 
were held and ruled by the sword of the barons; and their discord, pov- 
erty, and ignorance extended the ramifications of tyranny to the most 
sequestered villages. The Greeks were oppressed by the double weight 
of the priest, who was invested with temporal power, and of the soldier, 
who was inflamed by fanatic hatred; and the insuperable bar of religion 
and language for ever separated the stranger and the native. As long 

took his kingdom from him, all but a little bit round Sinope, which they 
left him. But in 1214 the Turks attacked him, and he fell in battle. 
Alexius, on the other hand, maintained himself at Trebizond, and the 
empire of Trebizond survived the Turkish conquest of Constantinople by 
eight years.- O. S.]

as the crusaders were united at Constantinople, the memory of their 
conquest, and the terror of their arms, imposed silence on the captive 
land: their dispersion betrayed the smallness of their numbers and the 
defects of their discipline; and some failures and mischances revealed 
the secret that they were not invincible. As the fear of the Greeks 
abated, their hatred increased. They murmured; they conspired; and 
before a year of slavery had elapsed, they implored, or accepted, the 
succour of a barbarian, whose power they had felt, and whose gratitude 
they trusted. 28 

The Latin conquerors had been saluted with a solemn and early em- 
bassy from John, or Joannice, or Calo-John, the revolted chief of the 
Bulgarians and Wallachians. He deemed himself their brother, as the 
votary of the Roman pontiff, from whom he had received the regal 
title and a holy banner; and in the subversion of the Greek monarchy 
he might aspire to the name of their friend and accomplice. But Calo- 
John was astonished to find that the count of Flanders has assumed the 
pomp and pride of the successors of Constantine; and his ambassadors 
were dismissed with a haughty message, that the rebel must deserve a 
pardon by touching with his forehead the footstool of the Imperial 
throne. His resentment 2 * would have exhaled in acts of violence and 
blood; his cooler policy watched the rising discontent of the Greeks, 
affected a tender concern for their sufferings, and promised that their 
first struggles for freedom should be supported by his person and king- 
dom. The conspiracy was propagated by national hatred, the firmest 
band of association and secrecy; the Greeks were impatient to sheathe 
their daggers in the breast of the victorious strangers; but the execution 
was prudently delayed till Henry, the emperor's brother, had transported 
the flower of his troops beyond the Hellespont. Most of the towns and 
villages of Thrace were true to the moment and the signal; and the 
Latins, without arms or suspicion, were slaughtered by the vile and 
merciless revenge of their slaves. From Demotica, the first scene of 
the massacre, the surviving vassals of the count of St. Pol escaped to 
Adrianople, but the French and Venetians, who occupied that city, were 
slain or expelled by the furious multitude; the garrisons that could 
effect their retreat fell back on each other towards the metropolis; and 
the fortresses, that separately stood against the rebels, were ignorant 
of each other's and of their sovereign's fate. The voice of fame and 
fear announced the revolt of the Greeks and the rapid approach of their 
Bulgarian ally; and Calo-John, not depending on the forces of his own 
kingdom, had drawn from the Scythian wilderness a body of fourteen. 

13 1 here begin to use, with freedom and confidence, the eight books of 
the Histoire de C. P. sous T Empire des Frangois, which Ducange has given 
as a supplement to Villehardouin ; and which, in a barbarous style, deserves 
the praise of an original and classic work. 

**In Calo- John's answer to the pope we may find his claims and com- 
plaints (Gesta Innocent. III. c. 108, 109) : he was cherished at Rome as the 
prodigal son.

thousand Comans, who drank, as it was said, the blood of their cap- 
tives, and sacrificed the Christians on the altars of their gods. 25 

Alarmed by this sudden and growing danger, the emperor despatched 
a swift messenger to recall Count Henry and his troops; and had Bald- 
win expected the return of his gallant brother, with a supply of twenty 
thousand Armenians, he might have encountered the invader with equal 
numbers and a decisive superiority of arms and discipline. But the 
spirit of chivalry could seldom discriminate caution from cowardice, 
and the emperor took the field with a hundred and forty knights, and 
their train of archers and Serjeants. The marshal, who dissuaded and 
obeyed, led the vanguard in their march to Adrianople; the main body 
was commanded by the count of Blois; the aged doge of Venice fol- 
lowed with the rear; and their scanty numbers were increased from all 
sides by the fugitive Latins. They undertook to besiege the rebels of 
Adrianople; and such was the pious tendency of the crusades, that they 
employed the holy week in pillaging the country for their subsistence, 
and in framing engines for the destruction of their fellow-Christians. 
But the Latins were soon interrupted and alarmed by the light cavalry 
of the Comans, who boldly skirmished to the edge of their imperfect 
lines; and a proclamation was issued by the marshal of Romania, that, 
on the trumpet's sound, the .cavalry should mount and form; but that 
none, under pain of death, should abandon themselves to a desultory 
and dangerous pursuit. This wise injunction was first disobeyed by the 
count of Blois, who involved the emperor in his rashness and ruin. The 
Comans, of the Parthian or Tartar school, fled before their first charge; 
but after a career of two leagues, when the knights and their horses 
were almost breathless, they suddenly turned, rallied, and encompassed 
the heavy squadrons of the Franks. The count was slain on the field, 
the emperor was made prisoner; and if the one disdained to fly, if the 
other refused to yield, their personal bravery made a poor atonement 
for their ignorance or neglect of the duties of a general. 28 

Proud of his victory and his royal prize, the Bulgarian advanced to 
relieve Adrianople and achieve the destruction of the Latins. They 
must inevitably have been destroyed if the marshal of Romania had 
not displayed a cool courage and consummate skill, uncommon in all 
ages, but most uncommon in those times, when war was a passion 
-rather than a science. His grief and fears were poured into the 
firm and faithful bosom of the doge; but in the camp he diffused an 
assurance of safety, which could only be realised by the general belief. 
All day he maintained his perilous station between the city and the bar- 

28 The Comans were a Tartar or Turkman horde, which encamped in the 
twelfth and thirteenth centuries on the verge of Moldavia. The greater 
part were pagans, but some were Mohammedans, and the whole horde was 
converted to Christianity (A.D. 1370) by Lewis, king of Hungary.

barians; Villehardouin decamped in silence at the dead of night, and his 
masterly retreat of three days would have deserved the praise of Xeno- 
phon and the ten thousand. In the rear, the marshal supported the 
weight of the pursuit; in the front, he moderated the impatience of the 
fugitives, and wherever the Comans approached they were repelled by 
a line of impenetrable spears. On the third day the weary troops beheld 
the sea, the solitary town of Rodosto, 27 and their friends, who had landed 
from the Asiatic shore. They embraced, they wept; but they united 
their arms and counsels; and, in his brother's absence, Count Henry 
assumed the regency of the empire, at once in a state of childhood and 
caducity. 28 If the Comans withdrew from the summer heats, seven 
thousand Latins, in the hour of danger, deserted Constantinople, their 
brethren, and their vows. Some partial success was overbalanced by 
the loss of one hundred and twenty knights in the field of Rusium; and 
of the Imperial domain no more was left than the capital, with two or 
three adjacent fortresses on the shores of Europe and Asia. The king 
of Bulgaria was resistless and inexorable; and Calo-John respectfully 
eluded the demands of the pope, who conjured his new proselyte to 
restore peace and the emperor to the afflicted Latins. The deliverance 
of Baldwin was no longer, he said, in the power of man: that prince 
had died in prison, and the manner of his death is variously related by 
ignorance and credulity. The lovers of a tragic legend will be pleased 
to hear that the royal captive was tempted by the amorous queen of the 
Bulgarians; that his chaste refusal exposed him to the falsehood of a 
woman and the jealousy of a savage; that his hands and feet were sev- 
ered from his body; that his bleeding trunk was cast among the carcases 
of dogs and horses; and that he breathed three days before he was de- 
voured by the birds of prey. 29 About twenty years afterwards, in a 
wood of the Netherlands, a hermit announced himself as the true Bald- 
win, the emperor of Constantinople, and lawful sovereign of Flanders. 
He related the wonders of his escape, his adventures, and his penance, 
among a people prone to believe and to rebel; and, in the first transport, 
Flanders acknowledged her long-lost sovereign. A short examination 
before the French court detected the impostor, who was punished with 
an : ignominious death; but the Flemings still adhered to the pleasing

but Vigenerei in his version, has most absurdly substituted trois heures

several moderns, whose names I shall spare.

(p. 386-416 [p. 7P/I-853, ed. Bonn] ) ; and their omissions are supplied by

may^ prove the death of Baldwin i. By the firm belief of the French barons 
(Villehardouin, No. 230) ; 2. By the declaration of Calo-John himself, who 
excuses his not releasing the captive emperor, quia debitum carnis

error, and the countess Jane is accused by the gravest historians of sac- 
rificing to her ambition the life of an unfortunate father. 80 

In all civilised hostility a treaty is established for the exchange or 
ransom of prisoners; and if their captivity be prolonged, their condition 
is known, and they are treated according to their rank with humanity or 
honour. But the savage Bulgarian was a stranger to the laws of war; 
his prisons were involved in darkness and silence; and above a year 
elapsed before the Latins could be assured of the death of Baldwin, be- 
fore his brother, the regent Henry, would consent to assume the title 
of emperor. His moderation was applauded by the Greeks as an act 
of rare and inimitable virtue. Their light and perfidious ambition was 
eager to seize or anticipate the moment of a vacancy, while a law of 
succession, the guardian both of the prince and people, was gradually 
defined and confirmed in the hereditary monarchies of Europe. In the 
support of the Eastern empire Henry was gradually left without an as- 
sociate, as the heroes of the crusade retired from the world or from the 
war. The doge of Venice, the venerable Dandolo, in the fulness of 
years and glory sunk into the grave. The marquis of Montferrat was 
slowly recalled from the Peloponnesian war to the revenge of Baldwin 
and the defence of Thessalonica. Some nice disputes of feudal homage 
and service were reconciled in a personal interview between the emperor 
and the king; they were firmly united by mutual esteem and the com- 
mon danger; and their alliance was sealed by the nuptials of Henry with 
the daughter of the Italian prince. He soon deplored the loss of his 
friend and father. At the persuasion of some faithful Greeks, Boniface 
made a bold and successful inroad among the hills of Rhodope; the Bul- 
garians fled on his approach; they assembled to harass his retreat. On 
the intelligence that his rear was attacked, without waiting for any de- 
fensive armour, he leaped on horseback, couched his lance, and drove 
the enemies before him; but in the rash pursuit he was pierced -with a 
mortal wound, and the head of the king of Thessalonica was presented 
to Calo-John, who enjoyed the honours, without the merit, of victory. 
It is here, at this melancholy event, that the pen or the voice of Jeffrey 
of Villehardouin seems to drop or to expire; 81 and if he still exercised 
his military office of marshal of Romania, his subsequent exploits are 
buried in oblivion. 82 The character of Henry was not unequal to his 
arduous situation: in the siege of Constantinople, and beyond the Hd-

The marshal was alive in 1212, but he probably died soon afterwards, 
without returning to France (Ducange, Observations sur Villehardouin, 
p. 238}. His fief of Messinople, the gift of Boniface, was the ancient

among the cities of Thrace. (No. 141.)

lespont, he had deserved the fame of a valiant knight and a skilful com- 
mander, and his courage was tempered with a degree of prudence and 
mildness unknown to his impetuous brother. In the double war against 
the Greeks of Asia and the Bulgarians of Europe he was ever the fore- 
most on shipboard or on horseback; and though he cautiously provided 
for the success of his arms, the drooping Latins were often roused by 
his example to save and to second tLeir fearless emperor. But such 
efforts, and some supplies of men and money from France, were of less 
avail than the errors, the cruelty, and death of their most formidable 
adversary. When the despair of the Greek subjects invited Calo-John 
as their deliverer, they hoped that he would protect their liberty and 
adopt their laws; they were soon taught to compare the degrees of na- 
tional ferocity, and to execrate the savage conqueror, who no longer 
dissembled his intention of dispeopling Thrace, of demolishing the cities, 
and of transplanting the inhabitants beyond the Danube. Many towns 
and villages of Thrace were already evacuated; a heap of ruins marked 
the place of Philippopolis, and a similar calamity was expected at De- 
motica and Adrianople by the first authors of the revolt. They raised 
a cry of grief and repentance to the throne of Henry; the emperor alone 
had the magnanimity to forgive and trust them. No more than four 
hundred knights, with their Serjeants and archers, could be assembled 
under his banner; and with this slender force he fought and repulsed 
the Bulgarian, who, besides his infantry, was at the head of forty thou- 
sand horse. 33 In this expedition Henry felt the difference between a 
hostile and a friendly country; the remaining cities were preserved by 
his arms, and the savage, with shame and loss, was compelled to relin- 
quish his prey. The siege of Thessalonica was the last of the evils which 
Calo-John inflicted or suffered; he was stabbed in the night in his tent, 
and the general, perhaps the assassin, who found him weltering in his 
blood, ascribed the blow with general applause to the lance of St. Deme- 
trius." After several victories the prudence of Henry concluded an 
honourable peace with the successor of the tyrant, and with the Greek 
princes of Nice and Epirus. If he ceded some doubtful limits, an ample 
kingdom was reserved for himself and his feudatories; and his reign, 
which lasted only ten years, afforded a short interval of prosperity and 
peace. Far above the narrow policy of Baldwin and Boniface, he freely 
intrusted to the Greeks the most important offices of the state and army; 
and this liberality of sentiment and practice was the more seasonable, as 
the princes of Nice and Epirus had already learned to seduce and em- 

* [There was no battle. On the advance of the Latins, Kalo-John suddenly 
broke up his camp and retreated. The Latins considered this unexpected 
deliverance almost in the light of a miracle. It has been suggested by 
Le Beau that the defection of the Comans, who usually quitted the camp 
during the heat of summer, may have occasioned the defection of the 
Bulgarians. 0. S.]

ploy flie mercenary valour of the Latins. It was the aim of Henry to 
unite and reward his deserving subjects of every nation and language; 
but he appeared less solicitous to accomplish the impracticable union of 
the two churches. Pelagius, the pope's legate, who acted as the sover- 
eign of Constantinople, had interdicted the worship of the Greeks, and 
sternly imposed the payment of tithes, the double procession of the Holy 
Ghost, and a blind obedience to the Roman pontiff. As the weaker 
party, they pleaded the duties of conscience, and implored the rights of 
toleration: " Our bodies," they said, " are Caesar's, but our souls be- 
long only to God." The persecution was checked by the firmness of 
the emperor; 85 and if we can believe that the same prince was poisoned 
by the Greeks themselves, we must entertain a contemptible idea of the 
sense and gratitude of mankind. His valour was a vulgar attribute, 
which he shared with ten thousand knights: but Henry possessed the 
superior courage to oppose, in a superstitious age, the pride and avarice 
of the clergy. In the cathedral- of St. Sophia he presumed to place his 
throne on the right hand of the patriarch; and this presumption excited 
the sharpest censure of pope Innocent the Third. By a salutary edict, 
one of lie first examples of the laws of mortmain, he prohibited the 
alienation of fiefs; many of the Latins, desirous of returning to Europe, 
resigned their estates to the church for a spiritual or temporal reward; 
these holy lands were immediately discharged from military service,, and 
a colony of soldiers would have been gradually transformed into a col- 
lege of priests.** 

The virtuous Henry died at ThessaJonica in the defence of that king- 
dom, and of an" infant, the son of his friend Boniface: In the two first 
emperors of Constantinople the male line of the counts of Flanders was 
extinct. But their sister Yolande was the wife of a French prince, the 
mother of a numerous progeny; and one of her daughters had married 
Andrew kingr of Hungary, a brave and pious champion of the Cross. 
By seating him on the Byzantine throne, the barons of Romania would 
have acquired the forces of a neighbouring and warlike kingdom; but 
the prudent Andrew revered the laws of succession; and the princess 
Yolande, with her husband Peter of Cotirtenay, count of Auxerre, was 
invited by the Latins to assume the empire of the East. The royal 
birth of his father, the noble origin of- his mother, recommended to 
the barons of France the first-cottsm of their king. ESs reputation 
was fair, his possessions were ampte, and, in the bloody crusadfe-^giairist 
the Albigeois y the soldiers and priests- had been abundantly safisfietf 
of his zeal and valour. Vanity might applaud the elevation of a French 
emperor of Constantinople; but prudence must pity r rather than- envy,.

his treacherous and imaginary greatness. To assert and adorn his title, 
he was reduced to sell or mortgage the best of his patrimony. By 
these expedients, the liberality of his royal kinsman Philip Augustus, 
and the national spirit of chivalry, he was enabled to pass the Alps at 
the head of one hundred and forty knights, and five thousand five 
hundred Serjeants and archers. After some hesitation, pope Honorius 
the Third was persuaded to crown the successor of Constantine: but 
he performed the ceremony in a church without the walls, lest he should 
seem to imply or to bestow any right of sovereignty over the ancient 
capital of the empire. The Venetians had engaged to transport Peter 
and his forces beyond the Adriatic, and the empress, with her four 
children, to the Byzantine palace; but they required 3 as the price oi 
their service, that he should recover Durazzo from the despot of Epi- 
rus. Michael Angelus, or Comnenus, the first of his dynasty, had be- 
queathed the succession of his power and ambition to Theodore, his 
legitimate brother, who already threatened and invaded the establish- 
ments of the Latins. After discharging his debt by a fruitless assault, 
the emperor raised the siege to prosecute a long and perilous journey 
over land from Durazzo to Thessalonica. He was soon lost in the 
mountains of Epirus: the passes were fortified; his provisions ex- 
hausted; he was delayed and deceived by a treacherous negotiation; 
and, after Peter of Courtenay and the Roman legate had been ar- 
rested in a banquet, the French troops, without leaders or hopes, were 
eager to exchange their arms for the delusive promise of mercy and 
bread. Tie Vatican thundered; and the impious Theodore was threat- 
ened with the vengeance of earth and heaven; but the captive em- 
peror and his soldiers were forgotten, and the reproaches of the pope 
are confined to the imprisonment of his legate. No sooner was he 
satisfied by the deliverance of the priest and a promise of spiritual 
obedience, than he pardoned and protected the despot of Epirus. His 
peremptory commands suspended the ardour of the Venetians and the 
king of Hungary; and it was only by a natural or untimely death ST 
that Peter of Courtenay was released from his hopeless captivity. 38 

The long ignorance of his fate, and the presence of the lawful sover- 
eign, of Yolande, his wife or widow, delayed the proclamation of a 
new emperor. Before her death, and in the midst of her grief, she was 
delivered of a son, who was named Baldwin, .the last and most un- 
fortunate of the Latin princes of Constantinople. His birth endeared 
him to the barons of Romania; but his childhood would have pro- 
longed the troubles of a minority, and his claims were superseded by

the elder claims of his brethren. The first of these, Philip of Courte- 
nay, who derived from his mother the inheritance of Namur, had the 
wisdom to prefer the substance of a marquisate to the shadow of an 
empire; and on his refusal, Robert, the second of the sons of Peter and 
Yolande, was called to the throne of Constantinople. Warned by his 
father's mischance, he pursued his slow and secure journey through 
Germany and along the Danube: a passage was opened by his sister's 
marriage with the king of Hungary; and the emperor Robert was 
crowned by the patriarch in the cathedral of St. Sophia. But his reign 
was an era of calamity and disgrace; and the colony, as it was styled, 
of NEW FRANCE yielded on all sides to the Greeks of Nice and Epirus. 
After a victory, which he owed to his perfidy rather than his courage, 
Theodore Angelus entered the kingdom of Thessalonica; expelled the 
feeble Demetrius, the son of the marquis Boniface; erected his stand- 
ard on the walls of Adrianople; and added, by his vanity, a third or a 
fourth name to the list of rival emperors. The relics of the Asiatic 
province were swept away by John Vataces, the son-in-law and suc- 
cessor of Theodore Lascaris, and who, in a triumphant reign of thirty- 
three years, displayed the virtues both of peace and war. Under his 
discipline, the swords of the French mercenaries were the most effec- 
tual instrument of his conquests, and their desertion from the service 
of their country was at once a symptom and a cause of the rising 
ascendant of the Greeks. By the construction of a fleet he obtained 
the command of the Hellespont, reduced the islands of Lesbos and 
Rhodes, 80 attacked the Venetians of Candia, and intercepted the rare 
and parsimonious succours of the West. Once, and once only, the 
Latin emperor sent an army against Vataces; and in the defeat of that 
army, the veteran knights, the last of the original conquerors, were left 
on the field of battle. But the success of a foreign enemy was less pain- 
ful to the pusillanimous Robert than the insolence of his Latin sub- 
jects, who confounded the weakness of the emperor and of the empire. 
His personal misfortunes will prove the anarchy of the government and 
the ferociousness of the times. The amorous youth had neglected his 
Greek bride, the daughter of Vataces, to introduce into the palace a 
beautiful maid, of a private, though noble, family of Artois; and her 
mother had been tempted by the lustre of the purple to forfeit her 
engagements with a gentleman of Burgundy. His love was converted 
into rage; he assembled his friends, forced the palace gates, threw the 
mother into the sea, and inhumanly cut off the nose and lips of the 
wife or concubine of the emperor. Instead of punishing the offender, 
the barons avowed and applauded the savage deed, 40 which, as a

the chief power and made himself master of Rhodes. In 1233, John Vatatzes 
defeated Gabalas, and obliged him to own his suzerainty, but left him 
in possession. The island was finally conquered by the knights of St. John 
in 1310. 0. S.] 

^Marinus Sanutus (Secreta Fidelium Crucis, I. ii. p. 4, c. 18, p. 73) is so

prince and as a man, it was impossible that Robert should forgive. H 
escaped from the guilty city to implore the justice or compassion of 
the pope: the emperor was coolly exhorted to return to his station; 
before he could obey, he sunk under the weight of grief, shame, and 
impotent resentment.* 1 

It was only in the age of chivalry that valour could ascend from a 
private station to the thrones of Jerusalem and Constantinople. The 
titular kingdom of Jerusalem had devolved to Mary, the daughter of 
Isabella and Conrad of Montferrat, and the grand-daughter of Al- 
meric or Amaury. She was given to John of Brienne, of a nobk 
family in Champagne, by the public voice, and the judgment of Philip 
Augustus, who named him as the most worthy champion of the Holy 
Land. 42 In the fifth crusade he led a hundred thousand Latins to the 
conquest of Egypt: by him the siege of Damietta was achieved; and 
the subsequent failure was justly ascribed to the pride and avarice of 
the legate. After the marriage of his daughter with Frederic the Sec- 
ond 43 he was provoked by the emperor's ingratitude to accept the 
command of the army of the church; and though advanced in life, and 
despoiled of royalty, the sword and spirit of John of Brienne were still 
ready for the service of Christendom. In the seven years of his 
brother's reign, Baldwin of Courtenay had not emerged from a state 
of childhood, and the barons of Romania felt the strong necessity of 
placing the sceptre in the hands of a man and a hero. The veteran 
king of Jerusalem might have disdained the name and office of regent; 
they agreed to invest him for his life with the title and prerogatives 
of emperor, on the sole condition that Baldwin should marry his sec- 
ond daughter, and succeed at a mature age to the throne of Con- 
stantinople. The expectation, both of the Greeks and Latins, was 
kindled by the renown, the choice, and the presence of John of Brienne; 
and they admired his martial aspect, his green and vigorous age of 
more than fourscore years, and his size and stature, which surpassed 
the common measure of mankind. 44 But avarice, and the love of ease, 
appear to have chilled the ardour of enterprise: his troops were dis- 
banded, and two years rolled away without action or honour, till he 
was awakened by the dangerous alliance of Vataces emperor of Nice,

and land, with an army of one hundred thousand men, and a fleet of 
three hundred ships of war; while the entire force of the Latin em- 
peror was reduced to one hundred and sixty knights, and a small addi- 
tion of Serjeants and archers. I tremble to relate, that, instead of 
defending the city, the hero made a sally at the head of his cavalry; 
and that, of forty-eight squadrons of the enemy, no more than three 
escaped from the edge of his invincible sword. Fired by his example, 
the infantry and the citizens boarded the vessels that anchored close 
to the walls; and twenty-five were dragged in triumph into the har- 
bour of Constantinople. At the summons of the emperor, the vassals 
and allies armed in her defence; broke through every obstacle that 
opposed their passage; and, in the succeeding year, obtained a second 
victory over the same enemies. By the rude poets of the age John of 
Brienne is compared to Hector, Roland, and Judas Maccabseus: 40 but 
their credit, and his glory, receives some abatement from the silence 
of the Greeks. The empire was soon deprived of the last of her cham- 
pions; and the dying monarch was ambitious to enter paradise in the 
habit of a Franciscan friar.* 7 

In the double victory of John of Brienne I cannot discover the name 
or exploits of his pupil Baldwin, who had attained the age of military 
service, and who succeeded to the imperial dignity on the decease of 
his adoptive father. 48 The royal youth was employed on a commission 
more suitable to his temper; he was sent to visit the Western courts, 
of the pope more especially, and of the king of France; to excite their 
pity by the view of his innocence and distress; and to obtain some sup- 
plies of men or money for the relief of the sinking empire. He thrice 
repeated these mendicant visits, in which he seemed to prolong his

and Thessalonica, and subsequently brought under his sway Albania, Mace- 
donia, and the greater part of Thrace. He built the cathedral of Tirnovo in 
commemoration of his successful campaign. With regard to his antagonist, 
John de Brienne, he was elected emperor in 1229, but did not arrive at 
Constantinople until 1231. The siege did not begin until 1234. O. S.]

stay, and postpone Ms return; of the five-and-twenty years of his reign, 
a greater number were spent abroad than at home; and in no place did 
the emperor deem himself less free and secure than in his native coun- 
try and his capital. On some public occasions, his vanity might be 
soothed by the title of Augustus, and by the honours of the purple; 
and at the general council of Lyons, when Frederic the Second was 
excommunicated and deposed, his Oriental colleague was enthroned 
on the right hand of the pope. But how often was the exile, the va- 
grant, the Imperial beggar, humbled with scorn, insulted with pity, 
and degraded in his own eyes and those of the nations 1 In his first 
visit to England he was stopped at Dover by a severe reprimand, that 
he should presume, without leave, to enter an independent kingdom. 
After some delay, Baldwin, however, was permitted to pursue his jour- 
ney, was entertained with cold civility, and thankfully departed with a 
present of seven hundred marks. 40 From the avarice of Rome he could 
only obtain the proclamation of a crusade, and a treasure of indul- 
gences: a coin whose currency was depreciated by too frequent and 
indiscriminate abuse. His birth and misfortunes recommended him to 
the generosity of his cousin Louis the Ninth; but the martial zeal of 
the saint was diverted from Constantinople to Egypt and Palestine; 
and the public and private poverty of Baldwin was alleviated, for a 
moment, by the alienation of the marquisate of Namur and the lord- 
ship of Courtenay, the last remains of his inheritance. 50 By such 
shameful or ruinous expedients he once more returned to Romania, 
with an army of thirty thousand soldiers, whose numbers were doubled 
in the apprehension of the Greeks. His first despatches to France and 
England announced his victories and his hopes: he had reduced the 
country round the capital to the distance of three days' journey; and 
if he succeeded against an important, though nameless, city (most 
probably Chiorli),.the frontier would be safe and the passage acces- 
sible. But these expectations (if Baldwin was sincere) quickly van- 
ished like a dream: the troops and treasures of France melted away in 
his unskilful hands: and the throne of the Latin emperor was pro- 
tected by a dishonourable alliance with the Turks and Comans. To 
secure the former, he consented to bestow his niece on the unbelieving 
sultan of Cogni; to please the latter, he complied with their pagan 
rites; a dog was sacrificed between the two armies; and the contract- 
ing parties tasted each other's blood, as a pledge of their fidelity."

$60 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

In the palace, or prison, of Constantinople, the successor of Augustus 
demolished the vacant houses for winter-fuel, and stripped the lead 
from the churches for the daily expense of his family. Some usurious 
loans were dealt with a scanty hand by the merchants of Italy; and 
Philip, his son and heir, was pawned at Venice as the security for a 
debt. 82 Thirst, hunger, and nakedness are positive evils: but wealth 
is relative; and a prince, who would be rich in a private station, may 
be exposed by the increase of his wants to all the anxiety and bitter- 
ness of poverty. 

But in this abject distress the emperor and empire were still pos- 
sessed of an ideal treasure, which drew its fantastic value from the 
superstition of the Christian world. The merit of the true cross was 
somewhat impaired by its frequent division; and a long captivity 
among the infidels might shed some suspicion on the fragments that 
were produced in the East and West. But another relic of the Passion 
was preserved in the Imperial chapel of Constantinople; and the crown 
of thorns which had been placed on the head of Christ was equally 
precious and authentic. It had formerly been the practice of the 
Egyptian debtors to deposit, as a security, the mummies of their par- 
ents; and both their honour and religion were bound for the redemp- 
tion of the pledge. In the same manner, and in the absence of the 
emperor, the barons of Romania borrowed the sum of thirteen thousand 
one hundred and thirty-four pieces of gold M on the credit of the holy 
crown: they failed in the performance of their contract; and a rich 
Venetian, Nicholas Querini, undertook to satisfy their impatient credi- 
tors, on condition that the relic should be lodged at Venice, to become 
his absolute property if it were not redeemed within a short and defi- 
nite term. The barons apprised their sovereign of the hard treaty and 
impending loss; and as the empire could not afford a ransom of seven 
thousand pounds sterling, Baldwin was anxious to snatch the prize 
from the Venetians, and to vest it with more honour and emolument 
in the hands of the most Christian king. 54 Yet the negotiation was 
attended with some delicacy. In the purchase of relics the saint would 
have started at the guilt of simony; but if the mode of expression were 
changed, he might ^ lawfully repay the debt, accept the gift, and ac- 
knowledge the obligation. His ambassadors, two Dominicans, were 
despatched to Venice to redeem and receive the holy crown, which had 
escaped the dangers of the sea and the galleys of Vataces. On open- 
baptism, was buried at the gates of Constantinople with a live retinue of 
slaves and horses.

ing a wooden box they recognised the seals of the doge and barons, 
which were applied on a shrine of silver; and within this shrine the 
monument of the Passion was enclosed in a golden vase. The reluc- 
tant Venetians yielded to justice and power; the emperor Frederic 
granted a free and honourable passage; the court of France advanced 
as far as Troyes in Champagne to meet with devotion this inestimable 
relic: it was borne in triumph through Paris by the king himself, 
barefoot, and in his shirt; and a free gift of ten thousand marks of 
silver reconciled Baldwin to his loss. The success of this transaction 
tempted the Latin emperor to offer with the same generosity the re- 
maining furniture of his chapel; 53 a large and authentic portion of the 
true cross; the baby-linen of the Son of God; the lance, the sponge, 
and the chain of his Passion; the rod of Moses; and part of the skull 
of St. John the Baptist. For the reception of these spiritual treasures 
twenty thousand marks were expended by St. Louis on a stately founda- 
tion, the holy chapel of Paris, on which the muse of Boileau has be- 
stowed a comic immortality. The truth of such remote and ancient 
relics, which cannot be proved by any human testimony, must be ad- 
mitted by those who believe in the miracles which they have per- 
formed. About the middle of the last age, an inveterate ulcer was 
touched and cured by a holy prickle of the holy crown: 56 the prodigy 
is attested by the most pious and enlightened Christians of France; 
nor will the fact be easily disproved, except by those who are armed 
with a general antidote against religious credulity. 57 

The Latins of Constantinople 58 were on all sides encompassed and 
pressed: their sole hope, the last delay of their ruin, was in the division 
of their Greek and Bulgarian enemies; and of this hope they were de- 
prived by the superior arms and policy of Vataces emperor of Nice.

has dropped many circumstances which may be recovered from the larger 
history of George Acropolita and the three first books of Nicephorus

fortune to meet with learned editors, Leo Allatius at Rome, and John 
Voivin in the Academy of Inscriptions of Paris.

ful and prosperous under his reign; and the events of every campaign 
extended his influence in Europe. The strong cities of the hills of 
Macedonia and Thrace were rescued from the Bulgarians, and their 
kingdom was circumscribed by its present and proper limits along the 
southern banks of the Danube. The sole emperor of the Romans could 
no longer brook that a lord of Epirus, a Comnenian prince of the West, 
should presume to dispute or share the honours of the purple; and the 
humble Demetrius changed the colour of his buskins, and accepted with 
gratitude the appellation of despot. His own subjects were exasper- 
ated by his baseness and incapacity; they implored the protection of 
their supreme lord. After some resistance, the kingdom of Thessa- 
lonica was united to the empire of Nice; and Vataces reigned without 
a competitor from the Turkish borders to the Adriatic gulf. The 
princes of Europe revered his merit and power; and had he subscribed 
an orthodox creed, it should seem that the pope would have abandoned 
without reluctance the Latin throne of Constantinople. But the death 
of Vataces,- the short and busy reign of Theodore his son, and the 
helpless infancy of his grandson John, suspended the restoration of 
the Greeks. In the next chapter I shall explain their domestic revo- 
lutions; in this place it will be sufficient to observe that the young 
prince was oppressed by the ambition of his guardian and colleague 
Michael Palaeologus, who displayed the virtues and vices that belong 
to the founder of a new dynasty. The emperor Baldwin had flattered 
himself that he might recover some provinces or cities by an impotent 
negotiation. His ambassadors were dismissed from Nice with mockery 
and contempt. At every place which they named Palaeologus alleged 
some special reason which rendered it dear and valuable in his eyes: 
in the one he was born; in another he had been first promoted to mili- 
tary command; and in a third he had enjoyed, and hoped long to enjoy, 
the pleasures of the chase. " And what then do you propose to give 
us? " said the astonished deputies. " Nothing/' replied the Greek ^ " not 
a foot of land. If your master be desirous of peace, let him pay me, as 
an annual tribute, the sum which he receives from the trade and cus- 
toms of Constantinople. On these terms I may allow him to reign. If 
he refuses, it is war. I am not ignorant of the art of war, and I trust 
the event to God and my sword." 50 An expedition against the despot 
of Epirus was the first prelude of hfe arms. If a victory was fol- 
lowed by a defeat, if the race of the Comneni or Angeli survived in 
those mountains his efforts and his reign, the captivity of Villehar- 
douin prince of Achaia deprived the Latins of the most active and 
powerful vassal of their expiring monarchy. The republics of Venice 
and Genoa disputed, in the first of their naval wars, the command of 
the sea and the commerce of the East. Pride and interest attached 
the Venetians to the defence of Constantinople; their rivals were 
tempted to promote the desjgns of her enemies, and the -alliance of the

THE ROMAN EMPIRE 56S 

Senoese with the schismatic conqueror provoked the indignation of 
the Latin church. 00 

Intent on his great object, the emperor Michael visited in person and 
strengthened the troops and fortifications of Thrace. The remains of 
the Latins were driven from their kst possessions: he assaulted with- 
out success the suburb of Galata, and corresponded with a perfidious 
baron, who proved unwilling, or unable, to open the gates of the me- 
tropolis. The next spring his favourite general, Alexius Strategopulus, 
whom he had decorated with the tide of Csesar, passed the Hellespont 
with eight hundred horse and some infantry 01 on a secret expedition- 
.His instructions en joined him to approach, to listen, to watch, but not 
to risk any doubtful or dangerous enterprise against the city. The 
adjacent territory between the Propontis and the Black Sea was culti- 
vated by a hardy race of peasants and outlaws, exercised in arms, un- 
certain in their allegiance, but inclined by language, religion, and pres- 
ent advantage, to the party of the Greeks. They were styled the 
volunteers?* and by their free service the army of Alexius, with the 
regulars of Thrace and the Coman auxiliaries, 03 was augmented to the 
number of five-and-twenty thousand men. By the ardour of the vol- 
unteers, and by his own ambition, the Csesar was stimulated to disobey 
the precise orders of his master, in the just confidence that success 
would plead his pardon and reward. The weakness of Constantinople 
and the distress and terror of the Latins were familiar to the observa- 
tion of the volunteers; and they represented the present moment as 
the most propitious to surprise and conquest. A rash youth, the new 
governor of the Venetian colony, had sailed away with thirty galleys 
and the best of the French knights on a wild expedition to Daphnusia, 
d town on the Black Sea, at the distance of forty leagues, and the re- 
maining Latins were without strength or suspicion. They were in- 
formed that Alexius had passed the Hellespont; but their apprehen- 
sions were lulled by the smallness of his original numbers, and their 
imprudence had not watched the subsequent increase of his army. If 
be left his main body to second and support his operations, he might 
advance uaperceived in the night with a chosen detachment. While 

"The Greeks, ashamed of any foreign aid, disguise the alliance and 
succour of the Genoese; but ,the fact is proved by the .testimony of J. 
- Villani (Chron. 1. yi. c. 71, in Muratori, Script. Rerum Italicarum, torn, 
xiii. p. 202, 203) and William de Nangis (Annales de St. Louis, p. 248, in 
the Louvre Joinville), two impartial foreigners; and Urban IV. threatened 
to deprive Genoa of her archbishop. 

81 Some precautions must be used in reconciling the discordant numbers r 
the 800 soldiers of Nicetas, the 25,000 of Spandugino ,(apud Ducange, L v. 
c. 24) ; the Greeks and 'Scythians of Acropolita; and the numerous army 
of Michael, in the Epistles of pope Urban IV. (i. 129.)

Moldavia. A part of the horde had submitted to John Vataces, and was 
i&gt;robably settled as a nursery of soldiers on some waste lands of Thrace

some applied scaling-ladders to the lowest part of the walls, they wer&amp; 
secure of an old Greek who would introduce their companions through 
a subterraneous passage into his house; they could soon on the inside 
break an entrance through the golden gate, which had been long ob- 
structed; and the conqueror would be in the heart of the city before 
the Latins were conscious of their danger. After some debate, the 
Caesar resigned himself to the faith of the volunteers; they were trusty, 
bold, and successful; and, in describing the plan, I have already related 
the execution and success. 64 But no sooner had Alexius passed the 
threshold of the golden gate than he trembled at his own rashness; he 
paused, he deliberated, till the desperate volunteers urged him for- 
wards by the assurance that in retreat lay the greatest and most in- 
evitable danger. Whilst the Caesar kept his regulars in firm array, 
the Comans dispersed themselves on all sides; an alarm was sounded, 
and the threats of fire and pillage compelled the citizens to a decisive 
resolution. The Greeks of Constantinople remembered their native 
sovereigns; the Genoese merchants their recent alliance and Venetian 
foes; every quarter was in arms; and the air resounded with a general 
acclamation of " Long life and victory to Michael and John, the au- 
gust emperors of the Romans 1 " Their rival, Baldwin, was awakened 
by the sound; but the most pressing danger could not prompt him to 
draw his sword in the defence of a city which he deserted perhaps 
with more pleasure than regret: he fled from the palace to the sea- 
shore, where he descried the welcome sails of the fleet returning from the 
vain and fruitless attempt on Daphnusia. Constantinople was irre- 
coverably lost; but the Latin emperor and the principal families em- 
barked on board the Venetian galleys, and steered for the isle of Eubcea, 
and afterwards for Italy, where the royal fugitive was entertained by the 
pope and Sicilian king with a mixture of contempt and pity. From the 
loss of Constantinople to his death he consumed thirteen years solicit- 
ing the Catholic powers to join in his restoration: the lesson had been 
familiar to his youth; nor was his last exile more indigent or shame- 
ful than his three former pilgrimages to the courts of Europe. His 
son Philip was the heir of an ideal empire; and the pretensions of his 
daughter Catherine were transported by her marriage, to Charles of 
Valois, the brother of Philip the Fair, king of France. The house of 
Courtenay was represented in the female line by successive alliances, 
till the title of emperor of Constantinople, too bulky and sonorous for 
a private name, modesty expired in silence and oblivion. 65 

**The loss of Constantinople is briefly told by the Latins: the conquest 
is described with more satisfaction by the Greeks; by Acropolita (c. 85), 
Pachymer (L ii. a 26, 27), Nicephorus Gregoras (1. iv. c. i, 2). See Ducange, 
Hist de C. P. 1. v. c. 19-27. 

"See the three last books (1. v.-viii.) and the genealogical tables of

James de Baux, duke of Andria in the kingdom of Naples, the son of 
Margaret, daughter of Catherine de Valois, daughter of Catherine, daughter 
of Philip, son of Baldwin II. (Ducange, L viiL c. 37, 38). It is uncertain 
whether he left any posterity 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 5*/ 

After this narrative of the expeditions of the Latins to Palestine an&lt; 
Constantinople, I cannot dismiss the subject without revolving the 
general consequences on the countries that were the scene, and on the 
nations that were the actors, of these memorable crusades. 66 As soon 
as the arms of the Franks were withdrawn, the impression, though 
not the memory, was erased in the Mohammedan realms of Egypt and 
Syria. The faithful disciples of the prophet were never tempted by a 
profane desire to study the laws and languages of the idolaters; noi 
did the simplicity of their primitive manners receive the slightest al- 
teration from their intercourse in peace and war with the unknown 
strangers of the West. The Greeks, who thought themselves proud, 
but who were only vain, showed a disposition somewhat less inflexible. 
In the efforts for the recovery of their empire they emulated the 
valour, discipline, and tactics of their antagonists. The modern litera- 
ture of the West they might justly despise; but its free spirit would in- 
struct them in the rights of man; and some institutions of public and 
private life were adopted from the French. The correspondence of 
Constantinople and Italy diffused the knowledge of the Latin tongue; 
and several of the fathers and classics were at length honoured with a 
Greek version. 67 But the national and religious prejudices of the 
Orientals were inflamed by persecution; and the reign of the Latins 
confirmed the separation of the two churches. 

If we compare the era of the crusades, the Latins of Europe with 
the Greeks and Arabians, their respective degrees of knowledge, in- 
dustry, and art, our rude ancestors must be content with the third 
rank in the scale of nations. Their successive improvement and pres- 
ent superiority may be ascribed to a peculiar energy of character, to 
an active and imitative spirit, unknown to their more polished rivals, 
who at that time were in a stationary or retrograde state. With such 
a disposition the Latins should have derived the most early and essen- 
tial benefits from a series of events which opened to their eyes the 
prospect of the world, and introduced them to a long and frequent in- 
tercourse with the more cultivated regions of the East. The first 
and most obvious progress was in trade and manufactures, in the arts 
which are strongly prompted by the thirst of wealth, the calls of ne- 
cessity, and the gratification of the sense or vanity. Among the crowd 
of unthinking fanatics a captive or a pilgrim might sometimes observe 
the superior refinements of Cairo and Constantinople: the first im- 

w Abulf eda, who saw the conclusion of the crusades, speaks of the king- 
doms of the Franks and those of the Negroes as equally unknown (Prolegpm. 
ad Geograph.). Had he not disdained the Latin language, how easily might 
the Syrian prince have found books and interpreters 1 

07 A short and superficial account of these versions from Latin into Greek 
is given by Huet (de Interpretatione et de Claris Interpretibus, p. 131-135). 
Maximus Planudes, a monk of Constantinople (A.D. 1327-1353), has trans- 
lated Caesar's Commentaries, the Somnium Stipionis, the Metamorphoses 
and Heroides of Ovid, etc, (Fabric. Bib. Grsec. torn. x. p. 533). 



566 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

porter of windmills 8 was the benefactor of nations; and if such bless- 
ings are enjoyed without any grateful remembrance, history has con- 
descended to notice the more apparent luxuries of silk and sugar, 
which were transported into Italy from Greece and Egypt. But the in- 
tellectual wants of the Latins were more slowly felt and supplied; the 
ardour of studious curiosity was awakened in Europe By different 
causes and more recent events; and, in the age of the crusaders, they 
viewed with careless indifference the literature of the Greeks and Ara- 
bians. , Some rudiments of mathematical and medicinal knowledge 
might be imparted in practice and in figures; necessity might produce 
some interpreters for the grosser business of merchants and soldiers; 
but the commerce of the Orientals had not diffused the study and 
knowledge of their languages in the schools of Europe. 00 If a similar 
principle of religion repulsed the idiom of the Koran, it should have 
excited their patience and curiosity to understand the original text of 
the Gospel; and the same grammar would have unfolded the sense of 
Plato and the beauties of Homer. Yet, in a reign of sixty years, the 
Latins of Constantinople disdained the speech and learning of their 
subjects; and the manuscripts were the only treasures which the na- 
tives might enjoy without rapine or envy. Aristotle was indeed the 
oracle of the Western universities, but it was a barbarous Aristotle; 
and, instead of ascending to .the fountain head, his Latin votaries 
humbly accepted a corrupt and remote version from the Jews and 
Moors of Andalusia. The principle of the crusades was a savage fa- 
naticism; and the most important effects were analogous to the cause. 
Each pilgrim was ambitious to return with his sacred spoils, the relics 
of Greece and Palestine; 70 and each relic was preceded and followed by 
a train of miracles and visions. The belief of the Catholics was cor- 
rupted by new legends, their practice by new superstitions; and the 
establishment of the inquisition, the mendicant orders of monks and 
friars, the last abuse of indulgences, and the final progress of idolatry, 
flowed from the baleful fountain of the holy war. The active spirit of 
the Latins preyed on the vitals of their reason and religion; and if the 
ninth and tenth centuries were the times of darkness, the thirteenth 
and fourteenth were the age of absurdity and fable. 

In the profession of Christianity, in the cultivation of a fertile land, 
the northern conquerors of the Roman empire insensibly mingled with 
the provincials and rekindled the embers of the arts of antiquity. Their 

08 Windmills, first invented in the dry country of Asia Minor, were used 
in Normandy as early as the year 1105 (Vie privee des Francois, torn. L 
p. 42, 43; Ducange, Gloss. Latin, torn. iv. p. 474). 

See the Complaints of Roger Bacon (Biographia Britannica, vol. i. p. 418, 
Kippiss edition). If Bacon himself, or Gerbert, understood some Greek, 
they were prodigies, and owed nothing to the commerce of the East. 

Such was the opinion of the great Leibnitz (CEuvres de Fontenelle, 
torn. v. p. 458), a master of the history of the middle ages. I shall only 
instance the pedigree of the Carmelites and the flight of the house of 
.Loretto, which were both derived from Palestine. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 5*7 

settlements about the age of Charlemagne had acquired some degree 
of order and stability, when they were overwhelmed by new swarms of 
invaders, the Normans, Saracens, 71 and Hungarians, who replunged the 
western countries of Europe into their former state of anarchy and 
barbarism. About the eleventh century the second tempest had sub- 
sided by the expulsion or conversion of the enemies of Christendom: 
the tide of civilisation, which had so long ebbed, began to flow with a 
steady and accelerated course; and a fairer prospect was opened to the 
hopes and efforts of the rising generations. Great was the increase, and 
rapid the progress, during the two hundred years of the crusades; and 
some philosophers have applauded the propitious influence of these 
holy wars, which appear to me to have checked rather than forwarded 
the maturity of Europe. 72 The lives and labours of millions which 
were buried in the East would have been more profitably employed in 
the improvement of their native country: the accumulated stock of 
industry and wealth would have overflowed in navigation and trade; 
and the Latins would have been enriched and enlightened by a pure 
and friendly correspondence with the climates of the East. In one re- 
spect I can indeed perceive the accidental operation of the crusades, 
not so much in producing a benefit as in removing an evil. The larger 
portion of the inhabitants of Europe was chained to the soil, without 
freedom, or property, or knowledge; and the two orders of ecclesiastics 
and nobles, whose numbers were comparatively small, alone deserved 
the name of citizens and men. This oppressive system was supported 
by the arts of the dergy and the swords of the barons. The authority 
of the priests operated in the darker ages as a salutary antidote: they 
prevented the total extinction of letters, mitigated the fierceness of the 
times, sheltered the poor and defenceless, and preserved or revived the 
peace and order of civil society. But the independence, rapine, and 
discord of the feudal lords were unmixed with any semblance of good; 
and every hope of industry and improvement was crushed by the iron 
weight of the martial aristocracy. Among the causes that undermined 
that Gothic edifice, a conspicuous place must be allowed to the cru- 
sades. The estates of the barons were dissipated, and their race was 
often extinguished in these costly and perilous expeditions. Their pov- 
erty extorted from their pride those charters of freedom which unlocked 
the fetters of the slave, secured the farm of the peasant and the shop 
of the artificer, and gradually restored a substance and a soul to the 
most numerous and useful part of the community. The conflagration 
which destroyed the tall and barren trees of the forest gave air and 
scope to the vegetation of the smaller and nutritive plants of the soil. 

71 If I rank the Saracens with the barbarians, it is only relative to their 
wars, or rather inroads, in Italy and France, where their sole purpose was 
to plunder and destroy. 

"On this interesting subject, the progress of society in Europe, a strong 
ray of philosophic light has broke from Scotland in our own times; and 
it is with private,, as well as public regard, that I repeat the names of 
Hume, Robertson, and Adam Smith. 



568 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

Digression on the Family of Courtenay 

THE purple of three emperors who have reigned at Constantinople will 
authorise or excuse a digression on the origin and singular fortunes of 
the house of CouRTENAY, 73 in the three principal branches, I. Of 
Edessa; II. Of France; and III. Of England; of which the last only 
has survived the revolutions of eight hundred years. 

I. Before the introduction of trade, which scatters riches, and of 
knowledge, which dispels prejudice, the prerogative of birth is most 
strongly felt and most humbly acknowledged. In every age the laws 
and manners of the Germans have discriminated the ranks of society: 
the dukes and counts who shared the empire of Charlemagne converted 
their office to an inheritance; and to his children each feudal lord be- 
queathed his honour and his sword. The proudest families are content 
to lose, in the darkness of the middle ages, the tree of their pedigree, 
irhich, however deep and lofty, must ultimately rise from a plebeian 
root; and their historians must descend ten centuries below the Chris- 
tian era, before they can ascertain any lineal succession by the evi- 
dence of surnames, of arms, and of authentic records. With the first 
rays of light 7 * we discern the nobility and opulence of Atho, a French 
knight: his nobility, in the rank and title of a nameless father; his 
opulence, in the foundation of the castle of Courtenay in the district 
of Gatinois, about fifty-six miles to the south of Paris. From the reign 
of Robert, the son of Hugh Capet, the barons of Courtenay are con- 
spicuous among the immediate vassals of the crown; and Joscelin, the 
grandson of Atho and a noble dame, is enrolled among the heroes of 
the first crusade. A domestic alliance (their mothers were sisters) at- 
tached him to the standard of Baldwin of Bruges, the second count of 
Edessa; 'a princely fief, which he was worthy to receive and able to 
maintain, announces the number of his martial followers; and after the 
departure of his cousin, Joscelin himself was invested with the county 
of Edessa on both sides of the Euphrates. By economy in peace his 
territories were replenished with Latin and Syrian subjects; his maga- 
zines with corn, wine, and oil; his castles with gold and silver, with 
arms and horses. In a holy warfare of thirty years he was alternately 
a conqueror and a captive: but he died like a soldier, in a horse litter 
at the head of his troops; and his last glance beheld the flight of the 
Turkish invaders who had presumed on his age and infirmities. His 

ra I have applied but not confined myself to A Genealogical History of the 
noble and illustrious Family of Courtenay, by Esra Cleaveland, Tutor to Sir 
William Courtenay t and Rector of Honiton: Oxon. 1735, in folio. The 
first part is extracted from William of Tyre; the second from Bouchet's 
French history; and the third from various memorials, public, provincial, 
and private, of the Courtenays of Devonshire. The rector of Honiton has 
more gratitude than industry, and more industry than criticism. 

M The primitive record of the family is a passage of the continuator of 
AJmoin, a monk of Fleury, who wrote in the twelfth century. See his 
Chronicle, in the Historians of France (torn, xi, p. 276).

son and successor, of the same name, was less deficient in valour than 
in vigilance; but he sometimes forgot that dominion is acquired and 
maintained by the same arts. He challenged the hostility of the Turks 
without securing the friendship of the prince of Antioch; and, amidst 
the peaceful luxury of Turbessel, in Syria, 73 Joscelin neglected the de- 
fence of the Christian frontier beyond" the Euphrates. In his absence, 
Zenghi, the first of the Atabeks, besieged and stormed his capital, 
Edessa, which was feebly defended by a timorous and disloyal crowd 
of Orientals: the Franks were oppressed in a bold attempt for its re- 
covery, and Courtenay ended his days in the prison of Aleppo. He stfll 
left a fair and ample patrimony. But the victorious Turks oppressed 
on all sides the weakness of a widow and orphan; and, for the equiva- 
lent of an annual pension, they resigned to the Greek emperor the 
charge of defending, and the shame of losing, the last relics of the Latin 
conquest. The countess-dowager of Edessa retired to Jerusalem with 
her two children: the daughter, Agnes, became the wife and mother 
of a king; the son, Joscelin the Third, accepted the office of seneschal, 
the first of the kingdom, and held his new estates in Palestine by the 
service of fifty knights. His name appears with honour in aH the 
transactions of peace and war; but he finally vanishes in the fall of 
Jerusalem; and the name of Courtenay, in this branch of Edessa, was 
lost by the marriage of his two daughters with a French and a German 
baron. 76 

II. While Joscelin reigned beyond the Euphrates, his elder brother 
Milo, the son of Joscelin, the son of Atho, continued, near the Seine, to 
possess the castle of their fathers, which was at length inherited by 
Rainaud, or Reginald, the youngest of his three sons. Examples of 
genius or virtue must be rare in the annals of the oldest families; and, 
in a remote age, their pride will embrace a deed of rapine and violence; 
such, however, as could not be perpetrated without some superiority of 
courage, or, at least, of power. A descendant of Reginald of Courte- 
nay may blush for the public robber who stripped and imprisoned sev- 
eral merchants after they had satisfied the king's duties at Sens and 
Orleans. He will glory in the offence, since the bold offender could not 
be compelled to obedience and restitution till the regent and the cotihf 
of Champagne prepared to march against him at the head of an army. 77 
Reginald bestowed his estates on his eldest daughter, and his daugh- 
ter on the seventh son of king Louis the Fat; and their marriage was 

"Turbessel, or, as it is now styled, Telbesher, is fixed by D'Anville four- 
and-twenty miles from the great passage over the Euphrates at Zeugma. 

76 His possessions are distinguished in the Assises of Jerusalem (c. 326) 
among the feudal tenures of the kingdom, which must therefore have been 
collected between the years 1153 and 1187. His pedigree may be found 
in the Lignages d'Outremer, c. 16.

ously arranged in the Epistles of the abbot and regent Suger (cxiv. cxvi.).

THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

with a numerous offspring. We might expect that a private 
ave merged in a royal name; and that the descendants of Peter 
of France and Elizabeth of Courtenay would have enjoyed the title and 
honours of princes of the blood. But this legitimate claim was long 
neglected, and finally denied; and the causes of their disgrace will rep- 
resent the story of this second branch, i. Of all the families now ex- 
tant, the most ancient, doubtless, and the most illustrious, is the house 
of France, which has occupied the same throne above eight hundred 
years, and descends, in a dear and lineal series of males, from the middle 
of the ninth century. 78 In the age of the crusades it was already revered 
both in the East and West. But from Hugh Capet to the marriage of 
Peter no more than five reigns or generations had elapsed; and so pre- 
carious was their title, that .the eldest sons, as a necessary precaution, 
.were previously crowned during the lifetime of their fathers. The peers 
af France have long maintained their precedency before the younger 
branches pf the royal line, nor had the princes of the blood, in the twelfth 
century, acquired that hereditary lustre which is now diffused over the 
jnost remote candidates for the succession. 2. The barons of Courte- 
nay must have stood high in their own estimation, and in that of the 
world, since they could impose on the son of a king the obligation of 
adopting for himself and all his descendants the name and arms of 
their daughter and his wife. In the marriage of an heiress with her 
inferior or her equal, such exchange was often required and allowed: 
but as they continued to diverge from the regal stem, the sons of Louis 
the Fat were insensibly confounded with their maternal ancestors; and 
the new Courtenays might deserve to forfeit the honours of their birth, 
'Which a motive of interest had tempted them to renounce. 3. The 
shame was Jar more permanent than the reward, and a momentary 
blaze was followed by a long darkness. The eldest son of these nup- 
tials, Peter .of Courtenay, had married, as I have already mentioned, 
.the sister of the counts of Flanders, the two first emperors of Constan- 
tinople; he rashly accepted the invitation of the barons of Romania; 
his two sons, Robert and Baldwin, successively held and lost the re- 
mains of the Latin empire in the East, and the grand-daughter of Bald-

win the Second again mingled her blood with the blood of France and 
of Valois. To support the expenses of a troubled and transitory reignj 
their patrimonial estates were mortgaged or sold; and the last emperors 
of Constantinople depended on the annual charity of Rome and Naples, 
While the elder brothers dissipated their wealth in romantic adven- 
tures, and the castle of Courtenay was profaned by a plebeian owner, 
the younger branches of that adopted name were propagated and multi- 
plied. But their splendour was clouded by poverty and time: after the 
decease of Robert, great butler of France, they descended from princes 
to barons; the next generations were confounded with the simple gentry j 
the descendants of Hugh Capet could no longer be visible in the rural 
lords of Tanlay and of Champignelles. The more adventurous embraced 
without dishonour the profession of a soldier: the least active and opu- 
lent might sink, like their cousins of the branch of Dreux, into the con- 
dition of peasants. Their royal descent in a dark period, of four hun- 
dred years became each day more obsolete and ambiguous; and their 
pedigree, instead of being enrolled in the annals of the kingdom, must 
be painfully searched by the minute diligence of heralds and genealo- 
gists. It was not till the end of the sixteenth century, on the accession 
of a family almost as remote as their own, that the princely spirit of 
the Courtenays again revived; and the question of the nobility provoked 
them to assert the royalty of their blood. They appealed to the jus- 
tice and compassion of Henry the Fourth; obtained a favourable opin- 
ion from twenty lawyers of Italy and Germany, and modestly compared 
themselves to the descendants of king David, whose prerogatives were 
not impaired by the lapse of ages or the trade of a carpenter. Bui 
every ear was deaf, and every circumstance was adverse, to their law- 
ful claims. The Bourbon kings were justified by the neglect of the 
Valois; the princes of the blood, more recent and lofty, disdained the 
alliance of this humble kindred: the parliament, without denying their 
proofs, eluded a dangerous precedent by an arbitrary distinction, and 
established St. Louis as the first father of the royal line. 80 A repetition 

TO Of the various petitions, apologies, etc., published by the princes of 
Courtenay, I have seen the three following, all in octavo : i. De Stirpe et

to be pardoned, or tried, as princes of the blood.

justice. The sanctity of Louis IX. could not invest him with any special 
prerogative, and all the descendants of Hugh Capet inust be included in his 
original compact with the -French nation.

of complaints and protests was repeatedly disregarded; and the hope- 
less pursuit was terminated in the present century by the death of the 
last male of the family. 81 Their painful and anxious situation was 
alleviated by the pride of conscious virtue: they sternly rejected the 
temptations of fortune and favour; and a dying Courtenay would have 
sacrificed his son if the youth could have renounced, for any temporal 
interest, the right and title of a legitimate prince of the blood of 
France. 82 

III. According to the old register of Ford Abbey, the Courtenays of 
Devonshire are descended from prince Florus, the second son of Peter, 
and the grandson of Louis the Fat. 83 This fable of the grateful or venal 
monks was too respectfully entertained by our antiquaries, Camden 84 
and Dugdale: 85 but it is so clearly repugnant to truth and time, that the 
rational pride of the family now refuses to accept this imaginary 
founder. Their most faithful historians believe that, after giving his 
daughter to the king's son, Reginald of Courtenay abandoned his pos- 
sessions in France, and obtained from the English monarch a second 
wife and a new inheritance. It is certain, at least, that Henry the 
Second distinguished in his camps and councils a Reginald, of the name 
and arms, and, as it may be fairly presumed, of the genuine race, of 
the Courtenays of France. The right of wardship enabled a feudal 
lord to reward his vassal with the marriage and estate of a noble heiress; 
and Reginald of Courtenay acquired a fair establishment in Devonshire, 
where his posterity has been seated above six hundred years. 86 From 
a Norman baron, Baldwin de Brioniis, who had been invested by the 
Conqueror, Hawise, the wife of Reginald, derived the honour of Oke- 




a The last male of the Courtenays was Charles Roger, who died in the 
year 1730, without leaving any sons. The last female was Helene de Courte- 
nay, who married Louis de Beaufremont. Her title of Princess du Sang 
Royal de France was suppressed (February 7th, 1737) by an arret of the 
parliament of Paris. 

**The singular anecdote to which I allude is related in the Recueil des 
Pieces interessantes et peu connues (Maestricht, 1786, in 4 vols. I2mo) ; 
and the unknown editor quotes his author, who had received it from Helene de 
Courtenay, marquise de Beaufremont. 

"Dugdale, Monasticon Anglicanum, vol. i. p. 786. Yet this fable must 
have been invented before the reign of Edward III. The profuse devotion 
of the three first generations to Ford Abbey was followed by oppression on 
one side and ingratitude on the other; and in the sixth generation the 
monks ceased to register the births, actions, and deaths of their patrons

the sister of the earl of -Devon: at the end of a century, on the failure 
of the family of Rivers, 87 his great-grandson, Hugh the Second, suc- 
ceeded to a title which was still considered as a territorial dignity; and 
twelve earls of Devonshire, of the name of Courtenay, have flourished 
in a period of two hundred and twenty years. They were ranked among 
the chief of the barons of the realm; nor was it till after a strenuous 
dispute that they yielded to the fief of Arundd the first place in the 
parliament of England: their alliances were contracted with the noblest 
families, the Veres, Despensers, St. Johns, Talbots, Bohuns, and even 
the Plantagenets themselves; and in a contest with John of Lancaster, a 
Courtenay, bishop of London, and afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, 
might be accused of profane confidence in the strength and number 
of his kindred. In peace the earls of Devon resided in their numerous 
castles and manors of the west: their ample revenue was appropriated 
to devotion and hospitality: and the epitaph of Edward, surnamed, 
from his misfortune, the blind, from his virtues, the good, earl, incul- 
cates with much ingenuity a moral sentence, which may however be, 
abused by thoughtless generosity. After a grateful commemoration 
of the fifty-five years of union and happiness which he enjoyed with 
Mabel his wife, the good earl thus speaks from the tomb: 

What we gave, we have; 
What we spent, we had; 
What we left, we lost. 88 

But their losses, in this sense, were far superior to their gifts and ex* 
penses; and their heirs, not less than the poor, were the objects of their 
paternal care. The sums which they paid for livery and seisin attest 
the greatness of their possessions; and several estates have remained 
in their family since the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. In war 
the Courtenays of England fulfilled the duties, and deserved the hon- 
ours of chivalry. They were often intrusted to levy and command the 
militia of Devonshire and Cornwall; they often attended their supreme 
lord to the borders of Scotland; and in foreign service, for a stipulated 
price, they sometimes maintained fourscore men-at-arms and as many 
archers. By sea and land they fought under the standard of the Ed- 
wards and Henries: their names are conspicuous in battles, in tourna- 
ments, and in the original list of the Order of the Garter; three brothers 
shared the Spanish victory of the Black Prince; and in the lapse of six 
generations the English Courtenays had learned to despise the nation 
and country from which they derived their origin. In the quarrel of 
the two Roses the earls of Devon adhered to the house of Lancaster, 

"This great family, de Ripuariis, de Redvers, de Rivers, ended, in Edward 
the First's time, in Isabella de Fortibus, a famous and potent dowager, 
who long survived her brother and husband (Dugdale, Baronage, P. i. p. 

254-257).

and three brothers successively died either in the field or on the scaf- 
fold. Their honours and estates were restored by Henry the Seventh: 
a daughter of Edward the Fourth was not disgraced by the nuptials of 
a Courtenay; their son, who was created marquis of Exeter, enjoyed the 
favour of his cousin Henry the Eighth; and in the camp of Cloth of 
Gold he broke a lance against the French monarch. But the favour of 
Henry was the prelude of disgrace; his disgrace was the signal of death; 
and of the victims of the jealous tyrant the marquis of Exeter is one 
of the most noble and guiltless. His son Edward lived a prisoner in 
the Tower, and died an exile at Padua; and the secret love of queen 
Mary, whom he slighted, perhaps for the princess Elizabeth, has shed 
a romantic colour on the story of this beautiful youth. The relics of 
his patrimony were conveyed into strange families by the marriages of 
his four aunts; and his personal honours, as if they had been legally 
extinct, were revived by the patents of succeeding princes. But there 
still survived a lineal descendant of Hugh the first earl of Devon, a 
younger branch of the Courtenays, who had been seated at Powder- 
ham Castle above four hundred years, from the reign of Edward the 
Third to the present hour. Their estates have been increased by the 
grant and improvement of lands in Ireland, and they have been recently 
restored to the honours of the peerage. Yet the Courtenays still retain 
the plaintive motto which asserts the innocence and deplores the fall of 
their ancient house, 89 While they sigh for past greatness, they are 
doubtless sensible of present blessings: in the long series of the Courte- 
nay annals the most splendid era is likewise the most unfortunate; nor 
can an opulent peer of Britain be inclined to envy the emperors of Con- 
stantinople who wandered over Europe to solicit alms for the support 
of their dignity and the defence of their capital.

pages of the Byzantine annals I it would not be an easy task to equal 
the two characters of Theodore Lascaris and John Ducas Vataces, 
who replanted and upheld the Roman standard at Nice in Bithynia. 
The difference of their virtues was happily suited to the diversity of 
their situation. In his first efforts the fugitive Lascaris commanded 
only three cities and two thousand soldiers: his reign was the season of 
generous and active despair; in every military operation he staked his 
life and crown; and his enemies of the Hellespont and the Maeander 
were surprised by his celerity and subdued by his boldness. A victorious 
reign of eighteen years expanded the principality of Nice to the magni- 
tude of an empire. The throne of his successor and son-in-law Vataces 
was founded on a more solid basis, a larger scope, and more plentiful 
resources; and it was the temper, as well as the interest, of Vataces to 
calculate the risk, to expect the moment, and to insure the success, of his 
ambitious designs. In the decline of the Latins I have briefly exposed 
the progress of the Greeks; the prudent and gradual advances of a con- 
queror who, in a reign of thirty-three years, rescued the provinces from 
national and foreign usurpers, till he pressed on all sides the Imperial 
city, a leafless and sapless trunk, which must fall at the first stroke of 
the axe. But his interior and peaceful administration is still more de- 
serving of notice and praise. 8 The calamities of the times had wasted 
the numbers and the substance of the Greeks: the motives and the 
means of agriculture were extirpated; and the most fertile lands were 
left without cultivation or inhabitants. A portion of this vacant prop- 
erty was occupied and improved by the command, and for the benefit, 
of the emperor: a powerful hand and a vigilant eye supplied and^ sur- 
passed, by a skilful management, the minute diligence of a^private 
farmer: the royal domain became the garden and granary of Asia; and. 
without impoverishing the people, the sovereign acquired a fund of 
innocent and productive wealth. According to the nature of the soil, 
his lands were sown with corn or planted with vines; the pastures were 
filled with horses and oxen, with sheep and hogs; and when_ Vataces 
presented to the empress a crown of diamonds and pearls, he informed 
her, with a smile, that this precious ornament arose from the sale of the 
eggs of his innumerable poultry. The produce of his domain was ap- 
plied to the maintenance of his palace and hospitals, the calls of dignity 

*For the reigns of the Nicene emperors, more especially of John Vataces 
and his son, their minister, George Acropolita, is the only ^ genuine con-

at the age of nineteen (Hanckius de Script. Byzant. c. 33, 34, P-. 564-578; 
Fabric. Biblioth. Graec. torn, vi. p. 448-460). Yet the history of Nicephorus 
Gregoras, though of the fourteenth century, is a valuable narrative from 
the taking of Constantinople by the Latins.

good style. ^

and benevolence: the lesson was still more useful than the revenue: the 
plough was restored to its ancient security and honour; and the nobles 
were taught to seek a sure and independent revenue from their estates, 
instead of adorning their splendid beggary by the oppression of the 
people, or (what is almost the same) by the favours of the court. The 
superfluous stock of corn and cattle was eagerly purchased by the 
Turks, with whom Vataces preserved a strict and sincere alliance; but 
he discouraged the importation of foreign manufactures, the costly silks 
of the East and the curious labours of the Italian looms. " The de- 
mands of nature and necessity/ 7 was he accustomed to say, " are indis- 
pensable; but the influence of fashion may rise and sink at the breath 
of a monarch;" and both his precept and example recommended sim- 
plicity of manners and the use of domestic industry. The education of 
youth and the revival of learning were the most serious objects of his 
care; and, without deciding the precedency, he pronounced with truth 
that a prince and a philosopher 4 are the two most eminent characters 
of human society. His first wife was Irene, the daughter of Theodore 
Lascaris, a woman more illustrious by her personal merit, the milder 
virtues of her sex, than by the blood of the Angeli and Comneni that 
flowed in her veins, and transmitted the inheritance of the empire. 
After her death he was contracted to Anne or Constance, a natural 
daughter of the emperor Frederic the Second; but as the bride had not 
attained the years of puberty, Vataces placed in his solitary bed an 
Italian damsel of her train; 5 and his amorous weakness bestowed on the 
concubine the honours, though not the title, of lawful empress. His 
frailty was censured as a flagitious and damnable sin by the monks; and 
their rude invectives exercised and displayed the patience of the royal 
lover. A philosophic age may excuse a single vice, which was redeemed 
by a crowd of virtues; and in the review of his faults, and the more 
intemperate passions of Lascaris, the judgment of their contemporaries 
was softened by gratitude to the second founders of the empire. 6 The 
slaves of the Latins, without law or peace, applauded the happiness of 
their brethren who had resumed their national freedom; and Vataces 
employed the laudable policy of convincing the Greeks of every domin- 
ion that it was their interest to be enrolled in the number of his subjects. 
A strong shade of degeneracy is visible between John Vataces and his 
son Theodore; between the founder who sustained the weight, and the 
heir who enjoyed the splendour, of the Imperial crown. 7 Yet the char-

acter of Theodore was not devoid of energy; he had been educated in 
the school of his father, in the exercise of war and hunting: Constanti- 
nople was yet spared; but in the three years of a short reign he thrice 
led his armies into the heart of Bulgaria. His virtues were sullied by 
a choleric and suspicious temper: the first of these may be ascribed to 
the ignorance of control; and the second might naturally arise from a 
dark and imperfect view of the corruption of mankind. On a march in 
Bulgaria he consulted on a question of policy his principal ministers; 
and the Greek logothete, George Acropolita, presumed to offend him by 
the declaration of a free and honest opinion. The emperor half un- 
sheathed his scimitar; but his more deliberate rage reserved Acropolita 
for a baser punishment. One of the first officers of the empire was 
ordered to dismount, stripped of his robes, and extended on the ground 
in the presence of the prince and army. In this posture he was chas- 
tised with so many and such heavy blows from the dubs of two guards 
or executioners, that, when Theodore commanded them to cease, the 
great logothete was scarcely able to arise and crawl away to his tent. 
After a seclusion of some days he was recalled by a peremptory man- 
date to his seat in council; and so dead were the Greeks to the sense of 
honour and shame, that it is from the narrative of the sufferer himself 
that we acquire the knowledge of his disgrace. 8 The cruelty of the 
emperor was exasperated by the pangs of sickness, the approach of a 
premature end, and the suspicion of poison and magic. The lives and 
fortunes, the eyes and limbs, of his kinsmen and nobles, were sacrificed 
to each sally of passion; and before he died, the son of Vataces might 
deserve from the people, or at least from the court, the appellation of 
tyrant. A matron of the family of tie Palseologi had provoked his 
anger by refusing to bestow her beauteous daughter on the vile plebeian 
who was recommended by his caprice. Without regard to her birth or 
age, her body, as high as the neck was enclosed in a sack with several 
cats, who were pricked with pins to irritate their fury against their un- 
fortunate fellow-captive. In his last hours the emperor testified a wish 
to forgive and be forgiven, a just anxiety for the fate of John his son 
and successor, who, at the age of eight years, was condemned to the dan- 
gers of a long minority. His last choice instructed the office of guardian 
to the sanctity of the patriarch Arsenius, and to the courage of George 
Muzalon, the great domestic, who was equally distinguished by the 
royal favour and the public hatred. Since their connection with the 
Latins, the names and privileges of hereditary rank had insinuated 

his subjects, was applied to yataces and his son. But Pachymer (I. L c. 23) 
has mistaken the mild Darius for the cruel Cambyses, despot or tyrant 
of his people. By the institution of taxes, Darius had incurred the less 
odious, but more contemptible, name of K&lt;mjXos, merchant or broker 
(Herodotus, iii. 89). 

"Acropolita (c. 63) seems to admire his own firmness in sustaining a 
beating, and not returning to council till he was called. He relates the

imputed the errors and calamities of the late reign. In the first council

jof the altar; and the absent patriarch was associated with a new col-

French mercenaries: the private expense of a day never exceeded threes 
pieces of gold; but his ambition was rapacious and profuse, and his, 
gifts were doubled by the graces of his conversation and manners. The

Michael thrice escaped from the dangers in which he was involved by 
his own imprudence or that of his friends. I. Under the reign of Jus- 
tice and Vataces, a dispute arose lff between two officers, one of whom 
acciised the other of maintaining the hereditary right of the Palaeolog:. 
The cause was decided, according to the new jurisprudence of the Lat- 
ins, by single combat; the defendant was overthrown; but he persisted 
in declaring that himself alone was guilty, and that he had uttered 
these rash or treasonable speeches without the approbation or knowl- 
edge of his patron. Yet a cloud of suspicion hung over the ninocerice 
of the constable; he was still pursued by the whispers of malevolence; 
and .a subtle courtier, the archbishop of Philadelphia, urged him to 
accept the judgment of God in the fiery proof of the ordeal. 1 - Three 
days before the trial the patient's arm was enclosed in a bag, and secured 
by the royal signet; and it was incumbent on him to bear a red-hot 
ball of iron three times from the altar to the rails of the sanctuary, with- 
out artifice and without injury. Palaeologus eluded the dangerous ex- 
periment with sense and pleasantry. " I am a soldier," said he, " and 
will boldly enter the lists with my accusers; but a layman, a sinner like 
myself, is not endowed with the gif t of mirades. Your piety, most holy 
prelate, may deserve the interposition of Heaven, and from your hands 
I will receive the fiery globe, the pledge of. my innocence." The arch- 
bishop started; the emperor smiled; and the absolution or pardon of 
Michael was approved by new rewards and new services. It In the 
succeeding reign, as he held the government of Nice, he was secretly 
informed that the mind of - the absent prince was poisoned with jeal- 
ousy, and that death or blindness would be his final reward. Instead 
of awaiting the return and sentence of Theodore, tSe constable, witi' 
some followers,- escaped from the city and the empire, and,- though he 
was plundered by the Turkmans of the desert,, he found an hospitable 
refuge in the court of the sultan. In the ambiguous state of an exile,. 
Michael reconciled' the duties of gratitude and loyalty: drawing his 
sword against the Tartars; admonishing the* garrisons of the Roman 
limit; and promoting, by his influence, the restoration of peace, in 
which his pardon and recall were honourably included, in. While he 
guarded the West against the despot of Epirus, Michael was again sus- 
pected and condemned in the palace; and such was his loyalty or weak- 
ness, that he submitted to be led in chains above sk hundred miles 
from Durazzo to Nice. The civility of the messenger alleviated his 
disgrace, the emperor's sickness dispelled his danger; and the last breaft

of Theodore, which recommended his infant son, at once acknowledged 
the innocence and the power of Palaeologus. 

But his innocence had been too unworthily treated, and his power 
was too strongly felt, to curb an aspiring subject in the fair field that 
was opened to his ambition. 15 In the council after the death of Theo- 
dore, he was the first to pronounce, and the first to violate, the oath 
of allegiance to Muzalon; and so dexterous was his conduct that he 
reaped the benefit, without incurring the guilt, or at least the reproach, 
of the subsequent massacre. In the choice of a regent he balanced the 
interests and passions of the candidates, turned their envy and hatred 
from himself against each other, and forced every competitor to own 
that, after his own claims, those of Palaeologus were best entitled to the 
preference. Under the title of great duke, he accepted or assumed, 
during a long minority, the active powers of government; the patriarch 
was a venerable name, and the factious nobles were seduced or oppressed 
by the ascendant of his genius. The fruits of the economy of Vataces 
were deposited ha a strong castle on the banks of the Hermus, in the 
custody of the faithful Varangians; the constable retained his command 
or influence over the foreign troops; he employed the guards to possess 
the treasure, and the treasure to corrupt the guards; and whatsoever 
might be the abuse of the public money, his character was above the sus- 
picion of private avarice. 3y himself, or by his emissaries, he strove to 
persuade every rank of subjects that their own prosperity would rise in 
just proportion to the establishment of his authority. The weight of taxes 
was suspended, the perpetual theme of popular complaint; and he pro- 
hibited the trials by the ordeal and judicial combat. These barbaric in- 
stitutions were already abolished or undermined in France 16 and Eng- 
land; 17 and the appeal to the sword offended the sense of a civilised, 18 
and the temper of an unwarlike, people. For the future maintenance 

"Without comparing Pachymer to Thucydides or Tacitus, I will praise 
his narrative (1. i. c. 13-32, 1. ii. c. 1-9), which pursues the ascent of Palaeo- 
logus with eloquence, perspicuity, and tolerable freedom. Acropolita is 
more cautious, and Gregoras more concise. 

M The judicial combat was abolished by St Louis in his own territories; 
and his example and authority were at length prevalent in France (Esprit 
des Loix, 1. xxviii. c. 29). 

17 In civil cases Henry II. gave an option to the defendant: GlanviJe 
prefers the proof by evidence; and that by judicial combat is reprobated 
in the Fleta. Yet the trail by battle has never been abrogated in the English 
law, and it was ordered by the judges as late as the beginning of the last 
century. 

"Yet an ingenious friend has urged to me in mitigation of this practice, 
i. That in nations emerging from barbarism it moderates the licence of 
private war and arbitrary revenge. 2. That it is less absurd than the trials 
by the ordeal, or boiling water, or the cross, which it has contributed to 
abolish- 3. That it served at least as a test of personal courage; a quality 
so seldom, united with a base disposition, that the danger of a trial might 
be some check to a malicious prosecutor, and a useful barrier against 
injustice supported by power. The gallant and unfortunate earl of Surrey 
might probably have escaped his unmerited fate, had not his demand of 
the combat against his accuser been overruled.

of their wives and children the veterans were grateful; the priest and 
the philosopher applauded his ardent zeal for the advancement of re- 
ligion and learning; and his vague promise of. rewarding merit was ap- 
plied by every candidate to his own hopes. Conscious of the influence 
of the clergy, Michael successfully laboured to secure the suffrage of 
that powerful order. Their expensive journey from Nice to Magnesia 
afforded a decent and ample pretence: the leading prelates were tempted 
by the liberality of his nocturnal visits; and the incorruptible patriarch 
was flattered by the homage of his new colleague, who led his mule by 
the bridle into the town, and removed to a respectful distance the im- 
portunity of the crowd. Without renouncing his title by royal descent, 
Palaeologus encouraged a free discussion into the advantages of elective 
monarchy; and his adherents asked, with the insolence of triumph, what 
patient would trust his health, or what merchant would abandon his 
vessel, to the hereditary skill of a physician or a pilot? The youth of 
the emperor, and the impending dangers of a minority, required the 
support of a mature and experienced guardian; of an associate raised 
above the envy of his equals, and invested with the name and preroga- 
tives of royalty. For the interest of the prince and people, without any 
selfish views for himself or his family, the great duke consented to 
guard and instruct the son of Theodore: but he sighed for the happy 
moment when he might restore to his firmer hands the administration 
of his patrimony, and enjoy the blessings of a private station. He was 
first invested with the title and prerogatives of despot, which bestowed 
the purple ornaments and the second place in the Roman monarchy. 
It was afterwards agreed that John and Michael should be proclaimed 
as joint emperors, and raised on die buckler, but that the pre-eminence 
should be reserved for the birthright of the former. A mutual league 
of amity was pledged between the royal partners; and in case of a rup- 
ture, the subjects were bound, by their oath of allegiance, to declare 
themselves against the aggressor: an ambiguous name, the seed of dis- 
cord and civil war. Palaeologus was content; but on the day of the 
coronation, and in the cathedral of Nice, his zealous adherents most 
vehemently urged the just priority of his age and merit. The unsea- 
sonable dispute was eluded by postponing to a more convenient oppor- 
tunity the coronation of John Lascaris; and he walked with a slight dia- 
dem in the train of his guardian, who alone received the Imperial crown 
from the hands of the patriarch. It was not without extreme reluctance 
that Arsenius abandoned the cause of his pupil; but the Varangians 
brandished their battle-axes; a sign of assent was extorted from the 
trembling youth; and some voices were heard, that the life of a child 
should no longer impede the settlement of the nation. A full harvest of 
honours and employments was distributed among his friends by the 
grateful Palaeologus. In his own family he created a despot and two 
sebastocrators; Alexius Strategopulus was decorated with the title of 
Caesar; and that veteran commander soon repaid the obligation by re- 
storing Constantinople to the Greek emperor. 



52 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

It was in the second year of his reign, while he resided in the palace 
and gardens of Nymphaeum, 19 near Smyrna, that the first messenger 
arrived at the dead of night; and the stupendous intelligence was im- 
parted to Michael, after he had been gently waked by the tender pre- 
caution of his sister Eulogia. The man was unknown or obscure; he 
produced no letters from the victorious Csesar; nor could it easily be 
credited, after the defeat of Vataces and the recent failure of Palseologus 
himself, that the capital had been surprised by a detachment of eight 
hundred soldiers. As a hostage, the doubtful author was confined, with 
the assurance of death or an ample recompense; and the court was left 
some hours in the anxiety of hope and fear, till the messengers of Alexius 
arrived with the authentic intelligence, and displayed the trophies of 
the conquest, the sword and sceptre, 20 the buskins and bonnet, 21 of the 
usurper Baldwin, which he had dropped in his precipitate flight. A gen- 
eral assembly of the bishops, senators, and nobles was immediately con- 
vened, and never perhaps was an event received with more heartfelt and 
universal joy. In a studied oration the new sovereign of Constantinople 
congratulated his own and the public fortune. " There was a time," 
said he, " a far distant time, when the Roman empire extended to the 
Adriatic, the Tigris, and the confines of ^Ethiopia.. After the loss of the 
provinces, our capital itself, in these last and calamitous days, has been 
wrested from our hands by the barbarians of the West. From the low- 
est ebb the tide of prosperity has again returned in our favour; but our 
prosperity was that of fugitives and exiles; and when we were asked 
which was the country of the Romans, we indicated with a blush the 
dimate of the globe, and the quarter of the heavens. The divine Provi- 
dence has now restored to our arms the city of Constantine, the sacred 
seat of religion and empire; and it will depend on our valour and con- 
duct to render this important acquisition the pledge and omen of future 
victories/* So eager was the impatience of the prince and people, that 
Michael made his triumphal entry into Constantinople only twenty days 
after the expulsion of the Latins. The golden gate was thrown open at 
bis approach; the devout conqueror dismounted from his horse; and a 
miraculous image of Mary the Conductress was borne before him, that 
the divine Virgin in person might appear to conduct him to the temple 
of her Son, the cathedral of St. Sophia. But after the first transport 

* The site of Nymphseum is not clearly defined in ancient or modern 
geography. But from the last hours of Vataces (Acropolita, c. 52), it is 
evident the palace and gardens of his favourite residence were in tihe neigh- 
bourhood of Smyrna. Nymphseum , might be loosely placed in Lydis (Greg- 
oras, 1. vi. 6 [torn. i. p. 190, ed. Bonn]). 

**This sceptre,, the emblem of justice and power, was a long staff, such 
as was used by the "heroes in Homer. By the- latter Greeks it was named 
Dicanice, and" the Imperial sceptre was distinguished as usual by the red or 
purple colour. 

81 Acropolita affirms (c. 87) that this bonnet was after the French fashion; 
but from the ruby at the point or summit, Ducange (Hist, de C. P. 1. v. 
&lt;c. 28, 29.) believes that it was the high-crowned hat of the Greeks. Could 
Acropolita mistake the dress, of his own court? 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 5*3 

of Devotion and pride, he sighed at the dreary prospect of solitude and 
ruin. The palace was defiled with smoke and dirt, and the gross intem- 
perance of the Franks; whole streets had been consumed by fire, or 
were decayed by the injuries of time; the sacred and profane edifices 
were stripped of their ornaments; and, as if they were conscious of 
their approaching exile, the industry of the Latins had been confined to 
the work of pillage and destruction. Trade had expired under the pres- 
sure of anarchy and distress, and the numbers of inhabitants had de- 
creased with the opulence of the city. It was the first care of the Greek 
monarch to reinstate the nobles in the palaces of their fathers, and the 
houses, or the ground which they occupied, were restored to the fam- 
ilies that could exhibit a legal right of inheritance. But the far greater 
part was extinct or lost; the vacant property had devolved to the lord; 
he repeopled Constantinople by a liberal invitation to the provinces, and 
the brave volunteers were seated in the capital which had been recov- 
ered by their arms. The French barons and the principal families had 
retired with their emperor, but the patient and humble crowd of Latins 
was attached to the country, and indifferent to the change of masters, 
Instead of banishing the factories of the Pisans, Venetians, and Genoese, 
the prudent conqueror accepted their oaths of allegiance, encouraged 
their industry, confirmed their privileges, and allowed them to live 
under the jurisdiction of their proper magistrates. Of these nations the 
Pisans and Venetians preserved their respective quarters in the city; 
but the services and power of the Genoese deserved at the same time 
the gratitude and the jealousy of the Greeks. Their independent col- 
ony was first planted at the seaport town of Heraclea in Thrace. They 
were speedily recalled, and settled in the exclusive possession of the 
suburb of Galata, an advantageous post, in which they revived the com- 
merce and insulted the majesty of the Byzantine empire. 22 

The recovery of Constantinople was celebrated as the era of a new 
empire; the conqueror, alone, and by the right of the sword, renewed 
his coronation in the church of St. Sophia; and the name and honours 
of John Lascaris, his pupil and lawful sovereign, were insensibly abol- 
ished. But his claims still lived in the minds of the people, and the 
royal youth must speedily attain the years of manhood and ambition. 
By fear or conscience Palaeologus was restrained from dipping his hands 
in innocent and royal blood; but the anxiety of a usurper and a parent 
urged him to secure his throne by one of those imperfect crimes so 
familiar to the modern Greeks. The loss of sight incapacitated the 
young prince for the active business of the world: instead of the brutal 
violence of tearing out his eyes, the visual nerve was destroyed by the 
intense glare of a red-hot basin, 23 and John Lascaris was removed to a

distant castle, where he spent many years in privacy and oblivion. Such 
cool and deliberate guilt may seem incompatible with remorse; but if 
Michael could trust the mercy of Heaven, he was not inaccessible to the 
reproaches and vengeance of mankind, which he had provoked by cru- 
elty and treason. His cruelty imposed on a servile court the duties of 
applause or silence; but the clergy had a right to speak in the name 
of their invisible Master, and their holy legions were led by a prelate 
whose character was above the temptations of hope or fear. After a 
short abdication of his dignity, Arsenius 24 had consented to ascend the 
ecclesiastical throne of Constantinople, and to preside in the restoration 
of the church. His pious simplicity was long deceived by the arts of 
Palaeologus, and his patience and submission might soothe the usurper, 
and protect the safety of the young prince. On the news of his inhuman 
treatment the patriarch unsheathed the spiritual sword, and supersti- 
tion, on this occasion, was enlisted in the cause of humanity and jus- 
tice. In a synod of bishops, who were stimulated by the example of 
his zeal, the patriarch pronounced a sentence of excommunication, 
though his prudence still repeated the name of Michael in the public 
prayers. The Eastern prelates had not adopted the dangerous m^mma 
of ancient Rome; nor did they presume to enforce their censures by 
deposing princes or absolving nations from their oaths of allegiance. 
But the Christian who had been separated from God and the church 
became an object of horror, and, in a turbulent and fanatic capital, that 
horror might arm the hand of an assassin, or inflame a sedition of the 
people. Palaeologus felt his danger, confessed his guilt, and deprecated 
his judge: the act was irretrievable, the prize was obtained; and the 
most rigorous penance, which he solicited, would have raised the sinner 
to the reputation of a saint. The unrelenting patriarch refused to an- 
nounce any means of atonement or any hopes of mercy, and con- 
descended only to pronounce that, for so great a crime, great indeed 
must be the satisfaction. " Do you require," said Michael, " that I 
should abdicate the empire? " And at these words he offered, or seemed 
to offer, the sword of state. Arsenius eagerly grasped this pledge of sov- 
ereignty; but when he perceived that the emperor was unwilling to 
purchase absolution at so dear a rate, he indignantly escaped to his 
cell, and left the royal sinner kneeling and weeping before the door. 25 

from the visible ^ world: a foolish story! The word abacinare, in Latin and 
Italian, has furnished Ducange (Gloss. Latin.) with an opportunity to review 
the various modes of blinding: the more violent were scooping, burning 
with an iron or hot vinegar, and binding the head with a strong cord 
till the eyes burst from their sockets. Ingenious tyrants! 

"See tie first retreat and restoration of Arsenius, in Pachymer (1. ii. c. 
15, 1. iii. c. 1,2) and Nicephorus Gregoras (1. iii. c. i, L iy. c. i). Posterity 
justly accused the d#&amp;eta and pa6vpia&gt; of Arsenius, the virtues of a hermit, 
the vices of a minister (1. xii. c. 2). 

* The crime and excommunication of Michael are fairly told by Pachymer 
(1. iii. c. 10, 14, 19, etc.) and Gregoras (L iv. c. 4). His confession and 
penance restored their freedom. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 5*5 

The danger and scandal of this excommunication subsisted above 
three years, till the popular clamour was assuaged by time and repent- 
ance; till the brethren of Arsenius condemned his inflexible spirit, so 
repugnant to the unbounded forgiveness of the Gospel. The emperor 
had artfully insinuated, that, if he were still rejected at home, he might 
seek, in the Roman pontiff, a more indulgent judge; but it was far 
more easy and effectual to find or to place that judge at the head of the 
Byzantine church. 

Arsenius was involved in a vague rumour of conspiracy and disaffec- 
tion; some irregular steps in his ordination and government were liable 
to censure; a synod deposed him from the episcopal office; and he was 
transported under a guard of soldiers to a small island of the Propontis. 
Before his exile he sullenly requested that a strict account might be 
taken of the treasures of the church; boasted that his sole riches, three 
pieces of gold, had been earned by transcribing the psalms; continued 
to assert the freedom of his mind; and denied, with his last breath, the 
pardon which was implored by the royal sinner. 26 After some delay, 
Gregory, bishop of Adrianople, was translated to the Byzantine throne; 
but his authority was found insufficient to support the absolution of the 
emperor; and Joseph, a reverend monk, was substituted to that impor- 
tant function. This edifying scene was represented in the presence of 
the senate and people; at the end of six years the humble penitent was 
restored to the communion of the faithful; and humanity will rejoice 
that a milder treatment of the captive Lascaris was stipulated as a 
proof of his remorse. But the spirit of Arsenius still survived in a pow- 
erful faction of the monks and clergy, who persevered above forty-eight 
years in an obstinate schism. Their scruples were treated with tender- 
ness and respect by Michael and his son, and the reconciliation of the 
Arsenites was the serious labour of the church and state. In the con- 
fidence of fanaticism, they had proposed to try their cause by a miracle; 
and when the two papers, that contained their own and the adverse 
cause, were cast into a fiery brazier, they expected that the Catholic 
verity would be respected by the flames. Alas! the two papers were 
indiscriminately consumed, and this unforeseen accident produced the 
union of a day, and renewed the quarrel of an age. 27 The final treaty 

"Pachymer relates the exile of Arsenius (1. iv. c. 1-16) : he was one of 
the commissaries who visited him in the desert island. The last testament 
of the unforgiving patriarch is still extant (Dupin, Bibliotheque Ecclesias- 
tique, torn. x. p. 95). 

[The charges of Arsenius were of a wholly different nature from what is 
stated here. He was charged with omitting . the name of the emperor 
from his prayers, with allowing the sultan of Iconium to bathe in vessels 
signed with die cross, and to have admitted him to the church, though un- 
baptised, during the service. It was pleaded in favour of Arsenius, among 
other proofs of the sultan's Christianity, that he had offered to eat ham. It 
was after his exile that Arsenius was involved in the charge of conspiracy, 
O. S.] 

* Pachymer (1. vii. c. 22 [torn. iL p. 60, ed. Bonn! ) relates this miraculous 
trial like a philosopher, and treats with similar contempt a plot of the

displayed the victory of the Arseuites; the clergy abstained during forty 
days from all ecclesiastical functions; a slight penance was imposed on 
the laity, the body of Arsenius was deposited in the sanctuary, and in 
the name of the departed saint the prince and people were released 
from the sins of their fathers. 28 

The establishment of his family was the motive, or at least the pre- 
tence, of the crime of Palseologus; and he was impatient to confirm the 
succession, by sharing with his eldest son the honours of the purple. 
Andronicus, afterwards surnamed the Elder, was proclaimed and 
crowned emperor of the Romans in the fifteenth year of his age; and, 
from the first era of a prolix and inglorious reign, he held that august 
title nine years as the colleague, and fifty as the successor, of his father. 
Michael himself, had he died in a private station, would have bsen 
thought more worthy of the empire; and the assaults of his temporal 
and spiritual enemies left him few moments to labour for his own tame 
or the happiness of his subjects. He wrested from the Franks several 
of the noblest islands of the Archipelago Lesbos, Chios, and Rhodes: 
his brother Constantine was sent to command in Malvasia and Sparta; 
and the eastern side of the Morea, from Argos and Napoli to Cape 
Taenarus, was repossessed by the Greeks. This effusion of Christian 
blood was loudly condemned by the patriarch; and the insolent priest 
presumed to interpose his fears and scruples between the arms of princes. 
But in the prosecution of these western conquests the countries beyond 
the Hellespont were left naked to the Turks; and their depredations 
verified the prophecy of a dying senator, that A .hc recovery of Constan- 
tinople would be the ruin of Asia. The victories of Michael were 
achieved by his lieutenants; his sword -rusted in the palace; and, in the 
transactions of the emperor with the popes and the king of Naples, his 
political arts were stained with cruelty and fraud. 29 

I. The Vatican was the most natural refuge of a Latin emperor who 
had been driven from his throne; and pope Urban the Fourth appeared 
to pity the misfortunes, and vindicate the cause, of the fugitive Baldwin. 
A crusade, with plenary indulgence, was preached by his command 
against the schismatic Greeks: he excommunicated their allies and ad- 
herents; solicited Louis the Ninth in favour of his kinsman; and de- 

Arsenites, to hide a revelation in the coffin of some old saint (t vii. c. 13 
(torn. ii. p. 40, ed. Bonn]). He compensates this incredulity by an image 
that weeps, another that bleeds (1. vii. c. 30 [torn. ii. p. 82, ed. Bonn]), and 
the miraculous cures of a deaf and a mute patient (1. xi. c. 32 [torn. ii. 
P- 453, ed. Bonn]). 

"The .story of the Arsenites is spread through the thirteen hooks of 
Pachymer. Their union and triumph are reserved for Nicephorus Gregoras 
(1, vii. c. 9 [torn. i. p. 262, ed. Bonn]), who neither loves nor esteems these 
sectaries. ' 

* Of the thirteen books of Pachymer, the first six (as the fourth and fifth 
of Nicephorus Gregoras) contain the reign of Michael, at the time of whose 
death he was forty years of age. Instead of breaking, like his editor the 
Pere Poussin, his history into two parts, I follow Ducange and Cousin, who 
number the thirteen books in one series. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE S7 

manded a tenth of the ecclesiastic revenues of France and England for 
the service of the holy war. 80 The subtle Greek, who watched the rising 
tempest of the West, attempted to suspend or soothe the hostility of the 
pope by suppliant embassies and respectful letters; but he insinuated 
that the establishment of peace must prepare the reconciliation and 
obedience of the Eastern church. The Roman court could not be de- 
ceived by so gross an artifice; and Michael was admonished that the 
repentance of the son should precede the forgiveness of the father; and 
that faith (an ambiguous word) was the only basis of friendship and 
alliance. After a long and affected delay, the approach of danger, and 
the importunity of Gregory the Tenth, compelled him to enter on a 
more serious negotiation: he alleged the example of the great Vataces; 
and the Greek clergy, who understood the intentions of their prince, 
were not alarmed by the first steps of reconciliation and respect. But 
when he pressed the conclusion of the treaty, they strenuously declared 
that the Latins, though not in name, were heretics in fact, and that 
they despised those strangers as the vilest and most despicable portion 
of the human race. 81 It was the task of the emperor to persuade, to cor- 
rupt, to intimidate the most popular ecclesiastics, to gain the vote of 
each individual, and alternately to urge the arguments of Christian 
charity and the public welfare. The texts of the fathers and the arms 
of the Franks were balanced in the theological and political scale; and 
without approving the addition to the Nicene creed, the most moderate 
were taught to confess that the two hostile propositions of proceeding 
from the Father BY the Son, and of proceeding from the Father AND the 
Son, might be reduced to a safe and Catholic sense. 32 The supremacy 
of the pope was a doctrine more easy to conceive, but more painful to 
acknowledge; yet Michael represented to his monks and prelates that 
they might submit to name the Roman bishop as the first of the patri- 
archs; and that their distance and discretion would guard the liberties 
of the Eastern church from the mischievous consequences of the right 
of appeal He protested that he would sacrifice his life and empire 
rather than yield the smallest point of orthodox faith or national inde- 
pendence; and this declaration was sealed and ratified by a golden bull. 
The patriarch Joseph withdrew to a monastery, to resign or resume 
his throne, according to the event of the treaty: the letters of union and 
obedience were subscribed by the emperor, his son Andronicus, and 
thirty-five archbishops and metropolitans, with their respective synods; 

"Ducange, Hist, de C. P. L v. c. 33, etc., from the Epistles of Urban IV. 
"From their mercantile intercourse with the Venetians and Genoese, 



they branded the Latins as ictfanjXoi and pfoavtrot (Pachymer, L v. c. 10). 
"Some are heretics in name; others, like the Latins, in fact," said the 
learned Veccus (1. v. c. 12), who soon afterwards became a convert (c. 15, 16) 
and a patriarch (c. 24). 

83 In this class we may place Pachymer himself, whose copious and candid 
narrative occupies the fifth and sixth books of his history. Yet the Greek 
is silent on the council of Lyons, and seems to believe that the popes always 
resided in Rome and Italy (1. v. c. 17, 21). 



588 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

and. the episcopal list was multiplied by many dioceses which were 
annihilated under the yoke of the infidels. An embassy was composed 
of some trusty ministers and prelates: they embarked for Italy, with 
rich ornaments and rare perfumes, for the altar of St. Peter; and their 
secret orders authorised and recommended a boundless compliance. 
They were received in the general council of Lyons, by pope Gregory 
the Tenth, at the head of five hundred bishops. 33 He embraced with 
tears his long-lost and repentant children; accepted the oath of the am- 
bassadors, who abjured the schism in the name of the two emperors; 
adorned the prelates with the ring and mitre; chanted in Greek and 
Latin the Nicene creed with the addition of filioque; and rejoiced in the 
union of the East and West, which had been reserved for his reigjn. To 
consummate this pious work, the Byzantine deputies were speedily fol- 
lowed by the pope's nuncios; and their instruction discloses the policy 
of the Vatican, which could not be satisfied with the vain title of su- 
premacy. After viewing the temper of the prince and people, they were 
enjoined to absolve the schismatic clergy who should subscribe and 
swear their abjuration and obedience; to establish in all the churches 
the use of the perfect creed; to prepare the entrance of a cardinal legate, 
with the full powers and dignity of his office; and to instruct the em- 
peror in the advantages which he might derive from the temporal pro- 
tection of the Roman pontiff. 84 

But they found a country without a friend, a nation in which the 
names of Rome and Union were pronounced with abhorrence. The 
patriarch Joseph was indeed removed: his place was filled by Veccus, 
an ecclesiastic of learning and moderation; and the emperor was still 
urged by the same motives to persevere in the same professions. 85 But 
in his private language Palseologus affected to deplore the pride, and 
to blame the innovations, of the Latins; and while he debased his char- 
acter by this double hypocrisy, he justified and punished the opposition 
of his subjects. By the joint suffrage of the new and the ancient Rome, 
a sentence of excommunication was pronounced against the obstinate 
schismatics: the censures of the churches were executed by the sword 
of Michael; on the failure of persuasion, he tried the arguments of 
prison and exile, of whipping and mutilation those touchstones, says 
an historian, of cowards and the brave. Two Greeks still reigned in 
^Etolia, Epirus, and Thessaly, with the appellation of despots: they

Bad yielded to the sovereign of Constantinople, but they rejected the 
cfiains of the Roman pontiff, and supported their refusal by successful 
arms. Under their protection, the fugitive monks and bishops assembled 
in hostile synods, and retorted the name of heretic with the galling addi- 
tion of apostate: the prince of Trebizond was tempted to assume the 
forfeit title of emperor; and even the Latins of Negropont, Thebes, 
Athens, and the Morea forgot the merits of the convert, to join, with 
open or clandestine aid, the enemies of Palaeologus. His favourite gen- 
erals, of his own blood and family, successively deserted, or betrayed, 
the sacrilegious trust. His sister Eulogia, a niece, and two female 
cousins conspired against him; another niece, Mary queen of Bulgaria, 
negotiated his ruin with the sultan of Egypt; and, in the public eye, 
their treason was consecrated as the most sublime virtue. 36 To the 
pope's nuncios, who urged the consummation of the work, Palseologus 
exposed a naked recital of all that he had done and suffered for their 
sake. They were assured that the guilty sectaries, of both sexes and 
every rank, had been deprived of their honours, their fortunes, and 
their liberty; a spreading list of confiscation and punishment, which 
involved many persons the dearest to the emperor, or the best deserving 
of his favour. They were conducted to the prison, to behold f our princes 
of the royal blood chained in the four corners, and shaking their fetters 
b an agony of grief and rage. Two of these captives were afterwards 
released; the one by submission, the other by death: but the obstinacy 
of their two companions was chastised by the loss of their eyes; and 
the Greeks, the least adverse to the union, deplore that cruel and in- 
auspicious tragedy. 87 Persecutors must expect the hatred of those whonj 
they oppress; but they commonly find some consolation in the testimony 
of their conscience, the applause of their party, and, perhaps, the suc- 
cess of their undertaking. But the hypocrisy of Michael, which was 
prompted only by political motives, must have forced him to hate him- 
self, to despise his followers, and to esteem and envy the rebel cham- 
pions by whom he was detested and despised. While his violence was

pretum, and transcribed by Wading from the MSS. of the Vatican (A.D.

[The following is the summing up of Michael's character by Finlay in 
his Bysantine Empire (voL iii. p. 372) : "He was a type of the empire he re- 
established and transmitted to his descendants. He was ^ selfish, hypo- 
critical, able, and accomplished, an inborn liar, vain, meddling, ambitious, 
cruel, and rapacious. He has gained renown in history as the restorer of 
the Eastern empire; he ought to be execrated as the corruptor of the Greek 
race, for his reign affords a signal example of the extent to which a nation 
may be degraded by the misconduct of its sovereign when he is entrusted 
with despotic power." O. S.I

abhorred at Constantinople, at Rome his slowness was arraigned, and 
his sincerity suspected; till at length pope Martin the Fourth excluded 
the Greek emperor from the pale of a church into which he was striving 
to reduce a schismatic people. No sooner had the tyrant expired than 
the union was dissolved and abjured by unanimous consent; the 
churches were purified; the penitents were reconciled; and his son An- 
dronicus, after weeping the sins and errors of his youth, most piously 
denied his father the burial of a prince and a Christian. 88 

II. In the distress of the Latins the walls and towers of Constanti- 
nople had fallen to decay; they were restored and fortified by the policy 
of Michael, who deposited a plenteous store of corn and salt provisions, 
to sustain the siege which he might hourly expect from the resentment 
of the Western powers. Of these, the sovereign of the Two Sicilies was 
the most formidable neighbour; but as long as they were possessed by 
Mainfroy, the bastard of Frederic the Second, his monarchy was the 
bulwark, rather than the annoyance, of the Eastern empire. The 
usurper, though a brave and active prince, was sufficiently employed in 
the defence of his throne: his proscription fay successive popes had sep- 
arated Mainfroy from the common cause of the Latins; and the forces 
that might have besieged Constantinople were detained in a crusade 
against the domestic enemy of Rome. The prize of her avenger, the 
crown of the Two Sicilies, was won and worn by the brother of St. 
Louis, by Charles of Anjou and Provence, who led the chivalry of France 
on this holy expedition. 89 The disaffection of his Christian subjects 
compelled Mainfroy to enlist a colony of Saracens whom his father had 
planted in Apulia; and this odious succour will explain the defiance of 
the Catholic hero, who rejected all terms of accommodation. " Bear 
this message," said Charles, " to the sultan of Nocera, that God and 
the sword are umpire between us; and that he shall either send me to 
paradise, or I will send him to the pit of hell." The armies met; and 
though I am ignorant of Mainfroy's doom in the other world, in this 
he lost his friends, his kingdom, and his life, in the bloody battle of 
Benevento. Naples and Sicily were immediately peopled with a war- 
like race of French nobles; and their aspiring leader embraced the 
future conquest of Africa, Greece, and Palestine. The most specious 
reasons might point his first arms against the Byzantine empire; and 
PaJaeologus, diffident of his own strength, repeatedly appealed from

proves that, if the Greeks were the slaves of the emperor, the emperor was 
not less the slave of superstition and the clergy.

of the conquest of Naples by Charles of Anjou, may be found in the Floren-

(L vii. c. i-io, 25-30), which are published by Muratori in the eighth and 
thirteenth volumes of the Historians of Italy. In his Annals (torn. xi.

the ambition of Charles to the humanity of St. Louis, who still pre- 
served a just ascendant over the mind of his ferocious brother. For a 
while the attention of that brother was confined at home by the invasion 
cf Conradin, the last heir of the Imperial house of Swabia: but the hap- 
less boy sunk in the unequal conflict; and his execution on a public 
scaffold taught^ the rivals of Charles to tremble for their heads as well 
as their dominions. A second respite was obtained by the last crusade 
of St. Louis to the African coast; and the double motive of interest and 
duty urged the king of Naples to assist, with his powers and his pres- 
ence, the holy enterprise. The death of St. Louis released him from the 
importunity of a virtuous censor: the king of Tunis confessed himself 
the tributary and vassal of the crown of Sicily; and the boldest of the 
French knights were free to enlist under his banner against the Greek 
empire. A treaty and a marriage united his interest with the house of 
Courtenay; his daughter Beatrice was promised to Philip, son and heir 
of the emperor Baldwin; a pension of six hundred ounces of gold was 
allowed for his maintenance; and his generous father distributed among 
his allies the kingdoms and provinces of the East, reserving only Con- 
stantinople, and one day's journey round the city, for the Imperial do- 
main. 40 In this perilous moment Pateologus was the most eager to sub- 
scribe the creed, and implore the protection, of the Roman pontiff, who 
assumed, with propriety and weight, the character of an angel of peace, 
the common father of the Christians. By his voice the sword of Charles 
was chained in the scabbard; and the Greek ambassadors beheld him, 
in the pope's antechamber, biting his ivory sceptre in a transport of 
fury, and deeply resenting the refusal to enfranchise and consecrate bis 
arms. He appears to have respected the disinterested mediation of 
Gregory the Tenth; but Charles was insensibly disgusted by the pride 
and partiality of Nicholas the Third; and his attachment to his kindred, 
the Ursini family, alienated the most strenuous champion from the 
service of the church. The hostile league against the Greeks, of Philip 
the Latin emperor, the king of the Two Sicilies, and the republic of 
Venice, was ripened into execution; and the election of Martin the 
Fourth, a French pope, gave a sanction to the cause. Of the allies, 
Philip supplied his name; Martin, a bull of excommunication; the Vene- 
tians, a squadron of forty galleys; and the formidable powers of Charles 
consisted of forty counts, ten thousand men-at-arms, a numerous body 
of infantry, and a fleet of more than three hundred ships and transports. 
A distant day was appointed for assembling this mighty force in the 
harbour of Brindisi; and a previous attempt was risked with a detach- 
ment of three hundred knights, who invaded Albania and besieged the 
fortress of Belgrade. Their defeat might amuse with a triumph the van- 
ity of Constantinople; but the more sagacious Michael, despairing of

his arms, depended on the effects of a conspiracy; on the secret work- 
lags of a rat who gnawed the bow-string 41 of the Sicilian tyrant. 

Among the proscribed adherents of the house of Swabia, John of Pro- 
cida forfeited a small island of that name in the bay of Naples. His 
birth was noble, but his education was learned; and in the poverty of 
exile he was relieved by the practice of physic, which he had studied in 
the school of Salerno. Fortune had left him nothing to lose, except life; 
and to despise life is the first qualification of a rebel. Procida was en- 
dowed with the art of negotiation to enforce his reasons and disguise 
his motives; and in his various transactions with nations and men, he 
could persuade each party that he laboured solely for their interest. 
The new kingdoms of Charles were afflicted by every species of fiscal 
and military oppression; 42 and the lives and fortunes of his Italian^sub- 
jects were sacrificed to the greatness of their master and the licentious- 
ness of his followers. The hatred of Naples was repressed by his pres- 
ence; but the looser government of his vicegerents excited the contempt, 
as well as the aversion, of the Sicilians: the island was roused to a sense 
of freedom by the eloquence of Procida; and he displayed to every 
baron his private interest in the common cause. In the confidence of 
foreign aid, he successively visited the courts of the Greek emperor, 
and of Peter king of Arragon,* 3 who possessed the maritime countries 
of Valentia and Catalonia. To the ambitious Peter a crown was pre- 
sented, which he might justly daim by his marriage with the sister of 
Mainfroy, and by the dying voice of Conradin, who from the scaffold 
had cast a ring to his heir and avenger. Palaeologus was easily persuaded 
to divert his enemy from a foreign war by a rebellion at home; and a 
Greek subsidy of twenty-five thousand ounces of gold was most profit- 
ably applied to arm a Catalan fleet, which sailed under a holy banner 
to the specious attack of the Saracens of Africa. In the disguise of a 
monk or beggar, the indefatigable missionary of revolt flew from Con- 
stantinople to Rome, and from Sicily to Saragossa: the treaty was 
sealed with the signet of pope Nicholas himself, the enemy of Charles; 
and his deed of gift transferred the fiefs of St. Peter from the house of 
Anjou to that of Arragon. So widely diffused and so freely circulated, 
the secret was preserved above two years with impenetrable discretion; 
and each of the conspirators imbibed the maxim of Peter, who declared 
that he would cut off his left hand if it were conscious of the intentions 

41 The reader of Herodotus will recollect how miraculously the Assyrian 
host of Sennacherib was disarmed and destroyed (1. ii. c. 141). 

41 According to Sabas Malaspina (Hist. Sicula, 1. iii. c. 16, in Muratori, 
torn, via. p. 832), a zealous Guelph, the subjects of Charles, who had reviled 
Mainfroy as a wolf, began to regret him as a lamb; and he justifies their 
discontent by the oppressions of the French government (1. vi. c. 2, 7).

of his right. The mine was prepared with deep and dangerous artifice; 
but it may be questioned whether the instant explosion of Palermo were 
the effect of accident or design. 

On the vigil of Easter a procession of the disarmed citizens visited a 
church without the walls, and a noble damsel was rudely insulted by a 
French soldier.* 4 The ravisher was instantly punished with death; and 
if the people was at first scattered by a military force, their numbers 
and fury prevailed: the conspirators seized the opportunity; the flame 
spread over the island, and eight thousand French were exterminated in 
a promiscuous massacre, which has obtained the name of the SICILIAN 
VESPERS. 45 From every city the banners of freedom and the church 
were displayed: the revolt was inspired by the presence or the soul of 
Procida; and Peter of Arragon, who sailed from the African coast to 
Palermo, was saluted as the king and saviour of the isle. By the re- 
bellion of a people on whom he had so long trampled with impunity, 
Charles was astonished and confounded; and in the first agony of grief 
and devotion he was heard to exclaim, " O God! if thou hast decreed 
to humble me, grant me at least a gentle and gradual descent from the 
pinnacle of greatness! " His fleet and army, which already filled the 
seaports of Italy, were hastily recalled from the service of the Grecian 
war; and the situation of Messina exposed that town to the first storm 
of his revenge. Feeble in themselves, and yet hopeless of foreign suc- 
cour, the citizens would have repented and submitted on the assurance 
of full pardon and their ancient privileges. But the pride of the mon- 
arch was already rekindled; and the most fervent entreaties of the 
legate could extort no more than a promise that he would forgive the 
remainder after a chosen list of eight hundred rebels had been yielded 
to his discretion. The despair of the Messinese renewed their courage: 
Peter of Arragon approached to their relief, 46 and his rival was driven 
back by the failure of provision and the terrors of the equinox to the 
Calabrian shore. At the same moment the Catalan admiral, the famous 
Roger de Loria, swept the channel with an invincible squadron: the 
French fleet, more numerous in transports than in galleys, was either 
burnt or destroyed; and the same blow assured the independence of

45 The French were long taught to remember this bloody lesson: "If I 
am provoked (said Henry the Fourth), I will breakfast at Milan, and dine 
at Naples." "Your majesty (replied the Spanish ambassador) may perhaps 
arrive in Sicily for vespers." 

48 This revolt, with the subsequent victory, are related by two national 
writers, Bartholemy a Neocastro (in Muratori, torn, xiii.) and Nicholas 
Specialis (in Muratori, torn, x.), the one a^ contemporary, the other o the 
next century. The patriot Specialis disclaims the name of rebellion, and 
all previous correspondence with Peter of Arragon (nullo communicate 
consilio), who happened to be with a fleet and army on the African coast 
(1. i. c. 4, 9). 



594 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

Sicily and the safety of the Greek empire. A few days before his death 
the emperor Michael rejoiced in the fall of an enemy whom he hated 
and esteemed; and perhaps he might be content with the popular judg- 
ment, that, had they not been matched with each other, Constantinople 
and Italy must speedily have obeyed the same master. 47 From this 
disastrous moment the life of Charles was a series of misfortunes: his 
capital was insulted, his son was made prisoner, and he sunk into the 
grave without recovering the isle of Sicily, which, after a war of twenty 
years, was finally severed from the throne of Naples, and transferred, 
as an independent kingdom, to a younger branch of the house of 
Arragon. 48 

I shall not, I trust, be accused of superstition; but I must remark 
that, even in this world, the natural order of events will sometimes afford 
the strong appearances of moral retribution. The first Palaeologus had 
saved his empire by involving the kingdoms of the West in rebellion 
and blood; and from these seeds of discord uprose a generation of iron 
men, who assaulted and endangered the empire of his son. In modern 
times our debts and taxes are the secret poison which still corrodes the 
bosom of peace; but in the weak and disorderly government of the 
middle ages it was agitated by the present evil of the disbanded armies. 
Too idle to work, to proud to beg. the mercenaries were accustomed to 
a life of rapine; they could rob with more dignity and effect under a 
banner and a chief; and the sovereign, to whom their service was useless 
and their presence importunate, endeavoured to discharge the torrent 
on some neighbouring countries. After the peace of Sicily, many thou- 
sands of Genoese, Catalans** etc., who had fought by sea and land 
under the standard of Anjou or Arragon, were blended into one nation 
by the resemblance of their manners and interest, They heard that the 
Greek provinces of Asia were invaded by the Turks: they resolved to 
share the harvest of pay and plunder; and Frederic king of Sicily most 
liberally contributed the means of their departure. In a warfare of 
twenty years a ship or a camp was become their country; arms were 
their sole profession and property; valour was the only virtue which they 
knew; their women had imbibed the fearless temper of their lovers and 
husbands: it was reported that with a stroke of their broad-sword the 
Catalans could cleave a horseman and a horse; and the report itself 
was a powerful weapon. Roger de Flor 80 was the most popular of their 

47 Nicephorus Gregoras (1. v. c. 6) admires the wisdom of Providence in 
this equal balance of states and princes. For the honour of Palaeologus I 
had rather this balance had been observed by an Italian writer. 

* See the Chronicle of Villani, the eleventh volume of the Annali d'ltalia 
of Muratori, and the twentieth and twenty-first books of the Istoria Civile 
of Giannqne. 

*In this motley multitude the Catalans and Spaniards, the bravest of 
the soldiery, were styled by themselves and the Greets Amogavwes. Moncada 
derives their origin from the Goths, and Pachymer (L xi, c. 22 [torn. ii. p. 
416, ed. Bonn] ") from the Arabs, and, in spite of national and religious pride, 
I am afraid the latter is in the right.

chiefs; and his personal merit overshadowed the dignity of his prouder 
rivals of Arragon. The offspring of a marriage between a German 
gentleman of the court of Frederic the Second and a damsel of Brindisi, 
Rdger was successively a templar, an apostate, a pirate, and at length 
the richest and most powerful admiral of the Mediterranean. He sailed 
from Messina to Constantinople with eighteen galleys, four great ships, 
and eight thousand adventurers; and his previous treaty was faithfully 
accomplished by Andronicus the Elder, who accepted with joy and terror 
this_ formidable succour. A palace was allotted for his reception, and- 
a niece of the emperor was given in marriage to the valiant stranger, 
who was immediately created great duke or admiral of Romania. After 
a decent repose he transported his troops over the Propontis, and boldly 
led them against the Turks: in two bloody battles thirty thousand of 
the Moslems were slain: he raised the siege of Philadelphia, and de- 
served the name of the deliverer of Asia. But after a short season of 
prosperity the cloud of slavery and ruin again burst on that unhappy 
province. The inhabitants escaped (says a Greek historian) from the 
smokie into the flames; and the hostility of the Turks was less pernicious 
than the friendship of the Catalans. The lives and fortunes which they 
had rescued they considered as their own: the wiFing or reluctant maid : 
wa&amp; saved from the race of circumcision for the embraces of a Christian 
soldier: the exaction of fines and supplies was enforced by licentious 
rapine and arbitrary executions; and, on the resistance of Magnesia, 
the great duke besieged a city of the Roman empire. 51 These disorders 
he excused by the wrongs and passions- of a victorious army; nor would 
his own authority or person have been safe had he dared to punish his- 
faithful followers, who were defrauded of the just and covenanted price 
of their services.. The threats and complaints of Andronicus disclosed 
the nakedness of the empire. His golden bull had invited no more than 
five hundred horse and a thousand foot soldiers; yet the crowds of vol- 
unteers who migrated to the East had been enlisted and fed by his spon- 
taneous bounty. While his bravest allies were content with three by* 
zants or pieces of gold for" their monthly pay, an ounce or even two 
ounces of gold were assigned td- the Catalans, whose annual pension 
would thus amount to near a hundred pounds sterling: one of their 
chiefs had modestly rated at three hundred thousand crowns the vahfe 
of his future merits; and above a million had been issued from the 
treasury for the maintenance of these costly mercenaries. A cruel tax 
had been imposed on the corn of the husbandmen: one-third was re- 
sard to liave been the son of a falconer, his true name being Richard' Blum, 
the statement that he was the son of a gentleman of the court of Frederic 
III being denied. His career was romantic in the extreme. As to the 
numbers that constituted his expedition, Ramon de Montaner informs us 
that they were 36 sail, 1500 horsemen, 4000 Amogavares, 1000 foot soldiers, 
as well as the oarsmen and sailors.O. S.J 

- tt Some idea may be formed of the population o-f these cities from the 
36,000 inhabitants of Tralles, which, in the preceding reign, was rebuilt by 
the emperor, and ruined by the Turks. (Pachymer, 1. vi. c. 20, 21.)

trenched from the salaries of the public officers; and the standard of the 
coin was so shamefully debased, that of the f our-and-twenty parts only 
five were of pure gold. 52 At the summons of the emperor, Roger evacu- 
ated a province which no longer supplied the materials of rapine; but 
he refused to disperse his troops; and while his style was respectful, his 
conduct was independent and hostile. He protested that, if the emperor 
should march against him, he would advance forty paces to kiss the 
ground before him; but in rising from this prostrate attitude Roger 
had a life and sword at the service of his friends. The great duke of 
Romania condescended to accept the title and ornaments of Csesar; but 
he rejected the new proposal of the government of Asia with a subsidy 
of corn and money, on condition that he should reduce his troops to 
the harmless number of three thousand men. Assassination is the last 
resource of cowards. The Csesar was tempted to visit the royal resi- 
dence of Adrianople; in the apartment, and before the eyes, of the 
empress he was stabbed by the Alani guards; and, though the deed 
was imputed to their private revenge, his countrymen, who dwelt at 
Constantinople in the security of peace, were involved in the same 
proscription by the prince or people. The loss of their leader intimi- 
dated the crowd of adventurers, who hoisted the sails of flight, and 
were soon scattered round the coasts of the Mediterranean. But a 
veteran band of fifteen hundred Catalans or French stood firm in the 
strong fortress of Gallipoli on the Hellespont, displayed the banners of 
Arragon, and offered to revenge and justify their chief by an equal 
combat of ten or a hundred warriors. Instead of accepting this bold 
defiance, the emperor Michael, the son and 'colleague of Andronicus, 
resolved to oppress them with the weight of multitudes: every nerve 
was strained to form an army of thirteen thousand horse and thirty 
thousand foot, and the Propontis was covered with the ships of the 
Greeks and Genoese. In two battles by sea and land these mighty 
forces were encounted and overthrown by the despair and discipline of 
the Catalans: the young emperor fled to the palace, and an insufficient 
guard of light-horse was left for the protection of the open country. 
Victory renewed the hopes and numbers of the adventurers; every na- 
tion was blended under the name and standard of the great company; 
and three thousand Turkish proselytes deserted from the Imperial serv- 
ice to join this military association. In the possession of Gallipoli the

the progressive degradation of the gold coin. Even in the prosperous times 
of John Ducas Vataces, the byzants were composed in equal porportions 
of the pure and the baser metal The poverty of Michael Palaeologus com- 
pelled him to strike a new coin, with nine parts, or carats, of gold, and 
fifteen of copper alloy. After his death the standard rose to ten carats, 
till in the public distress it was reduced to the moiety. The prince was 
relieved for a moment, while credit and commerce were for ever blasted. 
In France the gold coin is of twenty-two carats (one twelfth alloy), and the 
standard of England and Holland is still higher.

Catalans intercepted the trade of Constantinople and the Black Sea t 
while they spread their devastations on either side of the Hellespont 
over the confines of Europe and Asia. To prevent their approach the 
greatest part of the Byzantine territory was laid waste by the Greeks 
themselves: the peasants and their cattle retired into the city; and 
myriads of sheep and oxen, for which neither place nor food could be 
procured, were unprofitably slaughtered on the same day. Four times 
the emperor Andronicus sued for peace, and four times he was inflexibly 
repulsed, till the want of provisions and the discord. of the chiefs com- 
pelled the Catalans to evacuate the banks of the Hellespont and the 
neighbourhood of the capital. After their separation from the Turks, 
the remains of the great company pursued their march through Mace- 
donia and Thessaly, to seek a new establishment in the heart of 
Greece. 58 

After some ages of oblivion Greece was awakened to new misfortunes 
by the arms of the Latins. In the two hundred and fifty years between 
the first and the last conquest of Constantinople that venerable land 
was disputed by a multitude of petty tyrants; without the comforts of 
freedom and genius, her ancient cities were again plunged in foreign 
and intestine war; and, if servitude be preferable to anarchy, they 
might repose with joy under the Turkish yoke. I shall not pursue the 
obscure and various dynasties that rose and fell on the continent or in 
the isles; but our silence on the fate of ATHENS 54 would argue a 
strange ingratitude to the first and purest school of liberal science and 
amusement. In the partition of the empire the principality of Athens

adopts these adventurers as French, has hunted their footsteps with his 
usual diligence (Hist de C. P. 1. vi. c. 22-46). He quotes an Arragonese 
history, which I have read with pleasure, and which the Spaniards extol 
as a model of style and composition (Expedicion de los Catalanes y Arra- 
goneses contra Turcos y Griegos : Barcelona, 1623, in quarto : Madrid, 1777, 
in octavo). Don Francisco de Moncada, Conde de Osona, may imitate 
Caesar or Sallust; he may transcribe the Greek or Italian contemporaries: 
but he never quotes his authorities, and I cannot discern any national records 
of the exploits of his countrymen. 

[Ramon de Montaner, one of the Catalans who accompanied Roger de 
Flor and who was governor of Gallipoli, records that Roger de Flor, other- 
wise the Great Duke, was recalled from Natolia on account of the war that 
had arisen on the death of Azan, king of Bulgaria. Andronicus claimed 
the kingdom for his nephews, the sons of Azan by his sister. Roger 
turned the tide of success in favour of the emperor and made peace. But 
Andronicus alienated the troops by paying them in debased coin. Accord- 
ing to Ramon, -Roger was murdered by order of Kyr Michael, son of the 
emperor. Ramon was left the governor and chancellor; all the scribes of 
the army remained with him, and with their aid he kept the books in 
which were registered the number of foot and horse employed on each 
expedition. 0. S.] *

French dynasties recapitulates the thirty-five passages in which he mentions 
the dukes of Athens.

and Thebes was assigned to Otho de la Roche, a noble warrior of Bur- 
gundy, 55 with the title of great duke, 60 which the Latins understood 
in their own sense, and the Greeks more foolishly derived from the age 
of Constantine. 57 Otho followed the standard of the marquis of Mont- 
ferrat: the ample state which he acquired by a miracle of conduct or 
fortune, 58 was peaceably inherited by his son and two grandsons, till 
the family, though not the nation, was changed by the marriage of an 
heiress into the elder branch of the house of Brienne. The son of that 
marriage, Walter de Brienne, succeeded to the duchy of Athens; and, 
with the aid of some Catalan mercenaries, whom he invested with iiefs, 
reduced above thirty castles of the vassal or neighbouring lords. But 
when he was informed of the approach and ambition of the great com- 
pany, he collected a force of seven hundred knights, six thousand four 
hundred horse, and eight thousand foot, and boldly met them on the 
banks of the river Cephisus in Boeotia. The Catalans amounted to no 
more than three thousand five hundred horse and four thousand foot; 
but the deficiency of numbers was compensated by stratagem and 
order. They formed round their camp an artificial inundation; the 
duke and his knights advanced without fear or precaution on the ver- 

85 He is twice mentioned by Villehardouin with honour (No. 151, 235); 
and under the first passage Ducange observes all that can be known of 
his person and family. 

"From these Latin princes of the fourteenth century, Boccace, Chaucer, 
and Shakspeare have borrowed their Theseus duke of Athens. An ignorant 
age transfers its own language and manners to the most distant times. 

[Otto de la Roche did not take any ducal title. The designation he did 
take was that of Sire, Meyas Kiywos, or Grand Lord. In the year 1254 a 
question having arisen between Guy de la Roche and the prince of Achaia 
respecting personal homage _ due to the former, it was referred to Louis 
XL, and Guy undertook a journey to the court of France. Louis deemed 
the case of so frivolous a nature that, in order to indemnify Guy for his 
trouble and expense, he authorised him to assume the title of Duke of 
Athens, instead of "Grand Sire." Otto de la Roche had resigned the 
government of Athens and of Thebes to his nephew Guy, son of his 
brother, Pons de Ray, and returned to end his days on his own moderate 
fief in France. Guy was succeeded by his eldest son John and, on the 
death of the latter without issue, by his second son William. The last 
named died in 1290, and was succeeded by his son Guy II. (great grand- 
nephew of Otto de la Roche), after whose death it was that Walter de 
Brienne succeeded to the duchy. Thus Gibbon's sentence should read, 
instead of "inherited by his son and two grandsons/' "inherited by his 
nephew, two grand-nephews, and a great grand-nephew." 0. S.] 

"The same Constantine gave to Sicily a king, to Russia the magnus 
dapifer of the empire, to Thebes the primicerius; and these absurd fables 
are properly lashed by Ducange (ad Nicephor. Greg. 1. vii. c. 5). By the 
Latins the lord of Thebes was styled, by corruption, the Megas Kurios, or 
Grand Sire! 

*Quodam miraculo, says Alberic. He was probably received by Michael 
Choniates, the archbishop who had defended Athens against the tyrant 
Leo Sgurus (Nicetas urbs capta, p. 805, ed. Bek.). Michael was the 
brother of the historian Nicetas; and his encomium of Athens is still 
extatot in MS. in the Bodleian library (Fabric. Biblioth. Graec. torn. vL 
P- 405).

dant meadow; their horses plunged into the bog; and he was ^ cut in 
pieces, with the greatest part of the French cavalry. His family and 
nation were expelled; and his son Walter de Brienne, the titular duke 
of Athens, the tyrant of Florence, and the constable of France, lost, his 
life in the field of Poitiers. Attica and Bceotia were the rewards of 
the victorious Catalans; they married the widows and daughters of the 
slain; and during fourteen years the great company was the terror 
of the Grecian states. Their factions drove them to acknowledge the 
sovereignty of the house of Arragon; and during the remainder of the 
fourteenth century Athens, as a government or an appanage, was suc- 
cessively bestowed by the kings of Sicily. After the French and Cata- 
lans, the third dynasty was that of the Accaioli, 5 ' a family, plebeian 
at Florence, potent at Naples, and sovereign in Greece. Athens, which 
they embellished with new buildings, became the capital of a state that 
extended over Thebes, Argos, Corinth, Delphi, and a part of Thessaly; 
and their reign was finally determined by Mohammed the ^Second, 
who strangled the last duke, and educated his sons in the discipline 
and religion of the seraglio. 

Athens, 00 though no more than the shadow of her former self, still 
contains about eight or ten thousand inhabitants: of these, three- 
fourths are Greeks hi religion and language; and the Turks, who com- 
pose the remainder, have relaxed, in their intercourse with the citizens, 
somewhat of the pride and gravity of tteir national character. The 
olive-tree, the gift of Minerva, flourishes in Attica; nor has the honey 

* [Of the Acciajoli, and their influence in Greece, Finlay states the follow- 
ing facts: 

"Several members of the family of the Acciajoli had formed a distin- 
guished commercial company at Florence In the thirteenth century, settled 
in the Peloponnesus about the middle of the fourteenth, under the pro- 
tection of Robert, king of Naples. Nicolas Acciajoli was invested in the 
year 1334 with the administration of the lands ^ which the company had 
acquired in payment or in security of the loans it had made to the _ royal 
house of Anjou, and he acquired additional possessions in the principality 
of Achaia, both by purchase and grant, from Catherine of Valois, titular 
empress of Romania and regent of Achaia for her son prince Robert. He 
was the founder of the fortunes of tiie family. Nicolas was invested by 
Catherine with the power of mortgaging, exchanging, and selling his fiefs 
without any previous authorisation from his suzerain. Nicolas acted as 
principal minister of Catherine, during a residence of three years in the 
Morea; and he made use of his position, like a prudent banker, to obtain 
considerable grants of territory. He returned to Italy in 1341, and never 
again visited Greece; but his estates in Achaia were administered by his 
relatives and other members of the banking house in Florence, many of 
whom obtained considerable fiefs for themselves through his influence."

"The modern account of Athens and the Athenians is extracted from 
Spon (Voyage en Grece, torn. ii. p. 79-199) and Wheeler (Travels into 
Greece, p. 337-414), Stuart (Antiquities of Athens, passim) and Chandler 
(Travels into Greece, p. 23-172). The first of these travellers visited Greece 
in the year 1676; the last 1765; and ninety years had not produced much 
difference in the tranquil scene.

of Mount Hymettus lost any part of its exquisite flavor: 61 but the 
languid t trade is monopolised by strangers, and the agriculture of a 
barren land is abandoned to the vagrant Wallachians. The Athenians 
are still distinguished by the subtlety and acuteness of their understand- 
ings; but these qualities, unless ennobled by freedom and enlightened 
by study, will degenerate into a low and selfish cunning: and it is a 
proverbial saying of the country, " From the Jews of Thessalonica, the 
Turks of Negropont, and the Greeks of Athens, good Lord deliver us I " 
This artful people has eluded the tyranny of the Turkish ba&amp;aws by 
an expedient which alleviates their servitude and aggravates their 
shame. About the middle of the last century the Athenians chose for 
their protector the Kislar Aga, or chief black eunuch of the seraglio. 
This Ethiopian slave, who possesses the sultan's ear, condescends to 
accept the tribute of thirty thousand crowns: his lieutenant, the Way- 
wode, whom he annually confirms, may reserve for his own about five 
or six thousand more; and such is the policy of the citizens, that they 
seldom fail to remove and punish an oppressive governor. Their pri- 
vate differences are decided by the archbishop, one of the richest prel- 
ates of the Greek church, since he possesses a revenue of one thousand 
pounds sterling; and by a tribunal of the eight geronti or elders, 
chosen in the eight quarters of the city: the noble families cannot trace 
their pedigree above three hundred years; but their principal members 
are dfetinguished by a grave demeanour, a fur cap, and the lofty ap- 
pellation of archon. By some, who delight in the contrast, the modern 
language of Athens is represented as the most corrupt and barbarous 
of the seventy dialects of the vulgar Greek: 62 this picture is too darkly 
coloured; but it would not be easy, in the country of Plato and De- 
mosthenes, to find a reader or a copy of their works. The Athenians 
walk with supine indifference among the glorious ruins of antiquity; 
and such is the debasement of their character, that they are incapable 
of admiring the genius of their predecessors. 68 

tt The ancients, or at least the Athenians, believed that all the bees in 
the world had been propagated from Mount Hymettus. They taught that 
health might be preserved, and life prolonged, by the external use of oil 
and the internal use of honey (Geoponica, L xv. c. 7, p. 1089-1094, edit.

THE ROMAN EMPIRE 6or 



CHAPTER LXIII (1282-1391 A.D.) 

Civil Wars, and Ruin of the Greek Empire Reigns of Andronicus the 
Elder and Younger, and John PalGologus- Regency, Revolt, Reign, and 
Abdication of John Cantacusene Establishment of a Genoese Colony 
at Pera or GalatOr-Thtfir Wars with the Empire and City of Con- 
stantinople 

THE long reign of Andronicus * the elder is chiefly memorable by the 
disputes of the Greek church, the invasion of the Catalans, and the rise 
of the Ottoman power. He is celebrated as the most learned and vir- 
tuous prince of the age; but such virtue, and such learning, contributed 
neither to the perfection of the individual nor to the happiness of so- 
ciety. A slave of the most abject superstition, he was surrounded on 
all sides by visible and invisible enemies; nor were the flames of hell 
less dreadful to his fancy than those of a Catalan or Turkish war 
Under the reign of the Palaeologi the choice of the patriarch was the 
most important business of the state; the heads of the Greek church 
were ambitious and fanatic monks; and their vices or virtues, their 
learning or ignorance, were equally mischievous or contemptible. By 
his intemperate discipline the patriarch Athanasius 2 excited the hatred 
of the clergy and people: he was heard to declare that the sinner should 
swallow the last dregs of the cup of penance; and the foolish tale was 
propagated of his punishing a sacrilegious ass that had tasted the let- 
tuce of a convent garden. Driven from the throne by the universal 
clamour, Athanasius composed before his retreat two papers of a very 
opposite cast. His public testament was in the tone of charity and res- 
ignation; the private codicil breatned the direst anathemas against the 
authors of his disgrace, whom he excluded for ever from the communion 
of the Holy Trinity, the angels, and the saints. This last paper he en- 
closed in an earthen pot, which was placed, by his order, on the top 
of one of the pillars in the dome of St. Sophia, in the distant hope of 
discovery and revenge. At the end of four years some youths, climb- 
ing by a ladder in search of pigeons' nests, detected the fatal secret; 
and, as Andronicus felt himself touched and bound by the excommuni- 
cation, he trembled on the brink of the abyss which had been so treach- 
erously dug under his feet. A synod of bishops was instantly convened 
to debate this important question: the rashness of these clandestine 
anathemas was generally condemned; but as the knot could be untied 

1 Andronicus himself will justify our freedom in the invective (Niceph- 
orus Gregoras, 1. i. c. i) which he pronounced against historic falsehood. 
It is true that his censure is more pointedly urged against calumny than 
against adulation. 

*For the anathema in the pigeon's nest, see Pachymer (1. ix. c. 24 
[torn. iL p. 249, ed. Bonn]), who relates the general history of Athanasius 
(I. viii. c. 13-16, 20-24, 1. x. c. 27-29, 31-36, 1. xl c. 1-3, 5, 6, 1. xiii. c. 8, 10, 
23, 35), and is followed by Nicephorus Gregoras (1, vi. c. 5, 7, 1. vii. c. I, 9),. 
who includes the second retreat of this second Chrysostom. 



6 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

only by the same hand, as that hand was now deprived of the crosier, 
it appeared that this posthumous decree was irrevocable by any earthly 
power. Some faint testimonies of repentance and pardon were ex- 
torted from the author of the mischief; but the conscience of the em- 
peror was still wounded, and he desired, with no less ardour than 
Athanasius himself, the restoration of a patriarch by whom alone he 
could be healed. At the dead of night a monk rudely knocked at the 
door of the royal bed-chamber, announcing a revelation of plague and 
famine, of inundations and earthquakes. Andronicus started from his 
bed and spent the night, in prayer, till he felt, or thought that he felt, 
a slight motion of the earth. The emperor on foot led the bishops and 
monks to the cell of Athanasius; and, after a proper resistance, the 
saint, from whom this message had been sent, consented to absolve the 
prince and govern the church of Constantinople. Untamed by dis- 
grace^ and hardened by solitude, the shepherd was. again odious to the 
flock, and his enemies, contrived a singular, and, as it proved, a suo 
cessful, mode of revenge. In the night they stole away the foot-stool 
or foot-cloth of his throne, which they secretly replaced with the deco- 
ration of a satirical picture. The emperor, was painted with a bridle 
in his mouth, and Athanasius leading the tractable beast to the feet, of 
Christ. The authors of the libel were detected and punished; but as 
their lives had been spared, the Christian 'priest in sullen indignation 
retired to his ceH; and the eyes of Andronicus, whith had been opened 
for a moment, were again closed by ltfs successor. 

If this transaction be one of the most curious and important of a 
reign of fifty years, I cannot at least accuse the brevity of my ma- 
terials^ since I reduce into some few pages the enormous folios of 
Pachymer, 8 Cantacuzene,* and Nicephorus Gregoras, 8 who have com- 
posed the prolix and languid story of the times. The name and situa- 
tion of the emperor John Cantacuzene might inspire the most lively 
curiosity. His memorials of forty years extend from the revolt of the 
younger Andronicus to his own abdication of the empire; and it is ob- 
served that, like Moses and Caesar, he was the principal actor in the 
scenes which he describes. But in this eloquent work we should vainly 
seek the sincerity of a hero or a penitent. Retired in a cloister from the 
vices and passions oi the world, he presents not a confession, but an 

/Pachymer in seven books, 377 folio pages, describes- the- first twenty- 
six years, of Andronicus the Elder: and marks the date of his composition 
by the current news, or lie of the day (AJD., 1308).. Either death or disgust 
prevented him from resuming the pen. 

4 After an interval of twelve years from, the conclusion of Pachymer, 
Cantacuzenus takes up ttepen; and his first book (c. 1-59, p. 9-150- [ed. Ven.1). 
relates the civil war an&lt;d- the&gt; eight last years of the elder Andronicus. 
The ingenious comparison with Moses and Caesar is fancied by Ms- French 
translator, the president Cousin. 

'Nicephorus Gregoras more briefly includes the* entire life and reign: of 
Andronicus. the Elder (L n. c. I L x. c. I, p. 96-291).. This is the part of 
which Gantaquzene complains as a false and, malicious representation of his

apology, of the life of an ambitious statesman. Instead of unfolding 
the true counsels and characters of men, he displays the smooth and 
specious surface of events, highly varnished with his own praises and 
those of his friends. Their motives are always pure; their ends al- 
ways legitimate: they conspire and rebel without any views of inter- 
est; and the violence which they inflict or suffer is celebrated as the 
spontaneous effect of reason and virtue. 

After the example of the first of the Palseologi, the elder Andronicus 
associated his son Michael to the honours of the purple; and from the 
age of eighteen to his premature death, that prince was acknowledged, 
above twenty-five years, as the second emperor of the Greeks.* At 
the head of an army he excited neither the fears of the enemy nor the 
jealousy of the court: his modesty and patience were never tempted to 
compute the years of his father; nor was that father compelled to re- 
pent of his liberality either by the virtues or vices of his son. The 
son of Michael was named Andronicus from his grandfather, to whose 
early favour he was introduced by that nominal resemblance. The 
blossoms of wit and beauty increased the fondness of the elder An- 
dronicus; and, with the common vanity of age, he expected to realise 
in the second, the hope which had been disappointed in the first, 
generation. The boy was educated in the palace as an heir and a 
favourite; and in the oaths and acclamations of the people, the august 
triad was formed by the names of the father, the son, -and the grand- 
son. But the younger Andronicus was speedily corrupted by Ids In- 
fant .greatness, while he beheld with puerile impatience the double ob- 
stacle that hung, and might long hang, over his rising ambition. It 
was not to acquire fame, -or to diffuse happiness, that he so ^eagerly 
aspired: wealth and impunity were in his eyes the most precious at- 
tributes of a monarch; and his first indiscreet demand was the sover- 
eignty of some rich and fertile island, where he might lead a life of 
independence and pleasure. The emperor was offended by the loud 
and frequent intemperance which disturbed his capital; the sums which 
his parsimony denied were supplied by the Genoese usurers of Pera; 
and the oppressive debt, which consolidated the interest of a faction, 
could be discharged only by a revolution. A beautiful female, a ma- 
tron in rank, a prostitute in manners, had instructed the younger 
Andronicus in the rudiments of love; but he had reason to suspect the 
nocturnal visits of a rival; and a stranger passing through the street 
was pierced by the arrows of his guards, who were placed in ambush 
at her door. That stranger was his brother, prince Manuel, who lan- 
guished and died of his wound; and the emperor Michael, their com-

the Latins (&amp;n xal yv&amp;iPB icol vlfrret Kal *%$fum, *** 7*w &gt;W Kal iroffiv

604 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

mon father, whose health was in a declining state, expired on the eighth 
day, lamenting the loss of both his children. 7 However guiltless in his 
intention, the younger Andronicus might impute a brother's and a 
father's death to the consequence of his own vices; and deep was the 
sigh of thinking and feeling men when they perceived, instead of 
sorrow and repentance, his ill-dissembled joy on the removal of two 
odious competitors. By these melancholy events, and the increase of 
his disorders, the mind of the elder emperor was gradually alienated; 
and, after many fruitless reproofs, he transferred on another grandson 8 
his hopes and affection. The change was announced by the new oath 
of allegiance to the reigning sovereign, and the person whom he should 
appoint for his successor; and the acknowledged heir, after a repetition 
of insults and complaints, was exposed to the indignity of a public 
trial. Before the sentence, which would probably have condemned him 
to a dungeon or a cell, the emperor was informed that the palace courts 
were filled with the armed followers of his grandson; the judgment 
was softened to a treaty of reconciliation; and the triumphant escape 
of the prince encouraged the ardour of the younger faction. 

Yet the capital, the clergy, and the senate adhered to the person, or 
at least to the government, of the old emperor; and it was only in the 
provinces, by flight, and revolt, and foreign succour, that the malcon- 
tents could hope to vindicate their cause and subvert his throne. The 
soul of the enterprise was the great domestic John Cantacuzene: the 
sally from Constantinople is the first date of his actions and memorials; 
and if his own pen be most descriptive of his patriotism, an unfriendly 
historian has not refused to celebrate the zeal and ability which he 
displayed in the service of the young emperor. 9 That prince escaped 
from the capital under the pretence of hunting; erected his standard 
at Adrianople; and, in a few days, assembled fifty thousand horse and 
foot, whom neither honour nor duty could have armed against the bar- 
barians. Such a force might have saved or commanded the empire; 
but their counsels were discordant, their motions were slow and doubt- 
ful, and their progress was checked by intrigue and negotiation. The 
quarrel of the two Andronici was protracted, and suspended, and re- 
newed, during a ruinous period of seven years. In the first treaty the 
relics of the Greek empire were divided: Constantinople, Thessalonica, 
and the islands were left to the elder, while the younger acquired the 

T We are indebted to Nicephorus Gregoras (1. viii. c. i) for the knowledge 
of this tragic adventure; while Cantacuzene more discreetly conceals the 
vices of Andronicus the Younger, of which he was the witness, and perhaps 
the associate (1. i. c. i, etc.). 

8 His destined heir was Michael Catharus, the bastard of Constantine his 
second son. In this project of excluding his grandson Andronicus, Niceph- 
orus Gregoras (L viii. c. 3 [6?]) agrees with Cantacuzene (1. i. c. I, 2). 

9 [The conduct of Cantacuzene was inexplicable even on his own showing. 
He was unwilling to dethrone the old emperor, and dissuaded the troops 
from the immediate march on Constantinople. The young Andronicus, 
he says, entered into his views, and wrote to warn the emperor of his 
danger when the march was determined. 0. S.] 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 6 5 

sovereignty of the greatest part of Thrace, from Philippi to the Byzan- 
tine limit. By the second treaty he stipulated the payment of his 
troops, his immediate coronation, and an adequate share of the power 
and revenue of the state. The third civil war was terminated by the 
surprise of Constantinople, the final retreat of the old emperor, and the 
sole reign of his victorious grandson. The reasons of this delay may 
be found in the characters of the men and of the times. When the 
heir of the monarchy first pleaded his wrongs and his apprehensions, 
he was heard with pity and applause; and his adherents repeated on all 
sides the inconsistent promise that he would increase the pay of the 
soldiers and alleviate the burdens of the people. The grievances of 
forty years were mingled in his revolt; and the rising generation was 
fatigued by the endless prospect of a reign whose favourites and maxims 
were of other times. The youth of Andronicus had been without spirit, 
his age was without reverence: his taxes produced an annual revenue 
of five hundred thousand pounds; yet the richest of the sovereigns of 
Christendom was incapable of maintaining three thousand horse and 
twenty galleys, to resist the destructive progress of the Turks. 10 " How 
different," said the younger Andronicus, "is my situation from that 
of the son of Philip! Alexander might complain that his father would 
leave him nothing to conquer: alas! my grandsire will leave me nothing 
to lose." But the Greeks were soon admonished that the public dis- 
orders could not be healed by a civil war; and that their young 
favourite was not destined to be the saviour of a falling empire. On 
the first repulse his party was broken by his own levity, their intestine 
discord, and the intrigues of the ancient court, which tempted each 
malcontent to desert or betray the cause of rebellion. Andronicus the 
younger was touched with remorse, or fatigued with business, or de- 
ceived by negotiation: pleasure rather than power was his aim; and 
the licence of maintaining a thousand hounds, a thousand hawks, and 
a thousand huntsmen, was sufficient to sully his fame and disarm his 
ambition. 

Let us now survey the catastrophe of this busy plot and the final 
situation of the principal actors. 11 The age of Andronicus was con- 
sumed in civil discord; and, amidst the events of war and treaty, his 
power and reputation continually decayed, till the fatal night in which 
the gates of the city and palace were opened without resistance to his 
grandson. His principal commander scorned the repeated warnings of 
danger; and, retiring to rest in the vain security of ignorance, aban- 

10 See Nicephorus Gregoras, 1. viii. c. 6 [torn. i. p. 317, ed. Bonn], The 
younger Andronicus' complained that in four years and four months a sum 
of 350,000 byzants of gold was due to him for the expenses of his house- 
hold (Cantacuzen. 1. i. c. 48 [torn. i. p. 237, ed. Bonn]). Yet he would have 
remitted the debt, if he might have been allowed to squeeze the farmers of 
the revenue. 

U I follow the chronology of Nicephorus Gregoras, who is remarkably 
exact. It is proved that Cantacuzene has mistaken the dates of his own 
actions, or rather that his text has been corrupted by igtforant transcribers. 



6o6. THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

doned the feeble monarch, with some priests and pages, to the terrors 
of a sleepless night. These terrors were quickly realised by the hostile 
shouts which proclaimed the titles and victory of Andronicus the 
younger; and the aged emperor, falling prostrate before an image of the 
Virgin, despatched a suppliant message to resign the sceptre and to 
obtain his life at the hands of the conqueror. The answer of his 
grandson was decent and pious; at the prayer of his friends the younger 
Andronicus assumed the sole administration; but the elder still en- 
joyed the name and pre-eminence of the first emperor, the use of the 
great palace, and a pension of twenty-four thousand pieces of gold, one 
half of which was assigned on the royal treasure and the other on the 
fishery of Constantinople. But his impotence was soon exposed to 
contempt and oblivion; the vast silence of the palace was disturbed 
only by the cattle and poultry of the neighbourhood, which roved with 
impunity through the solitary courts; and a reduced allowance of ten 
thousand pieces of gold 12 was all that he could ask and more than he 
could hope. His calamities were embittered by the gradual extinction 
of sight; his confinement was rendered each day more rigorous; and 
during the absence and sickness of his grandson, his inhuman keepers, 
by the threats of instant death, compelled him to exchange the purple 
for the monastic habit and profession. The monk Antony had re- 
nounced the pomp of the world: yet he had occasion for a coarse fur 
in the winter season; and as wine was forbidden by his confessor, and 
water by his physician, the sherbet of Egypt was his common drink. It 
was not without difficulty that the late emperor could procure three or 
four pieces to satisfy these simple wants; and if he bestowed the gold 
to relieve the more painful distress of a friend, the sacrifice is of some 
weight in the scale of humanity and religion. Four years after his 
abdication Andronicus, or Antony, expired in a cell, in the seventy- 
fourth year of his age: and the last strain of adulation could only 
promise a more splendid crown of glory in heaven than he had enjoyed 
upon earth. 13 

Nor was the reign of the younger, more glorious or fortunate than 
that of the elder, Andronicus. 1 * He gathered the fruits of ambition; 
but the taste was transient and bitter: in the supreme station he lost 
the remains of his early popularity; and the defects of his character 
became still more conspicuous to the world. The public reproach 
urged him to march in person against the Turks; nor did his courage

c. t i) with the 10,000 of Nicephorus Gregoras (1. ix. c. 2) ; the one of whom 
wished to soften, the other to magnify, the hardships of the old emperor. 

"See Nicephorus Gregoras (1. ix. 6, 7, 8, 10, 14, 1. x. c. i). The historian

lightly be accused as " a hireling, a prostitute to praise."

fail in the hour of trial; but a defeat and a wound were the only tro 
phies of his expedition in Asia, which confirmed the establishment of 
the Ottoman monarchy. The abuses of the civil government attained 
their full maturity and perfection: his neglect of forms and the con- 
fusion of national dresses are deplored by the Greeks as the fatal symp- 
toms of the decay of the empire. Andronicus was old before his time; 
the intemperance of youth had accelerated the infirmities of age;^ and 
after being rescued from a dangerous malady by nature, or physic, or 
the Virgin, he was snatched away before he had accomplished his forty- 
fifth year. He was twice married; and as the progress of the Latins 
hi arms and arts had softened the prejudices of the Byzantine court, 
his two wives were chosen in the princely houses of Germany and Italy. 
The first, Agnes at home, Irene in Greece, was daughter of the duke 
of Brunswick. Her father 15 was a petty lord 10 in the poor and savage 
regions of the north of Germany; 17 yet he derived some revenue from 
his silver-mines; 18 and his family is celebrated by the Greeks as the 
most ancient and noble of the Teutonic name. 10 After the death of this 

. ** Agnes, or Irene, was the daughter of duke Henry the Wonderful, the 
chief of the house of Brunswick, and the fourth in descent from the famous 
Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony and Bavaria, and conqueror of the Slav* 
on the Baltic coast Her brother Henry was surnamed the Greek, from 
his two journeys into the East: but these journeys were subsequent to his 
sister's marriage; and I am ignorant how Agnes was discovered in the 
heart of Germany, and recommended to the Byzantine court (Rimius, 
Memoirs of the House of Brunswick, p. 126-137.) 

"Henry the Wonderful was the founder of the branch of Grubenhagen, 
extinct in the year 1596. (Rimius, p. 287.) He resided in the castle of 
Wolfenbuttel, and possessed no more than a sixth part of the allodial 
estates of Brunswick and Luneburg, which the Guelph family had saved 
from the confiscation of their great fiefs. The frequent partitions among 
brothers had almost ruined the princely houses of Germany, till that just, 
but pernicious, law was slowly superseded by the right of primogeniture. 
The principality of Grubenhagen, one of the last remains of the Hercyman 
forest, is a woody, mountainous, and barren tract (Busching's Geography, 
vol. vi. p. 270-286, English translation.) 

"The royal author of the Memoirs of Brandenburg will teach us _ how 
justly, in a much later period, the north of Germany deserved the epithets 
of poor and barbarous. (Essai sur les Mceurs, etc.) In the year 1306, in 
the woods of Luneburg, some wild people of the Vened race were allowed 
to bury alive their infirm and useless parents. (Rimius, p. 136.) 

"The assertion of Tacitus, that Germany was destitute of the precious 
inetals, must be taken, even in his own time, with some limitation. (Ger- 
mania, c. 5; Annal. xi. 20.) According to Spener (Hist. Germanise Prag-

the silver-mines of Grubenhagen, or the Upper Hartz, which were pro- 
ductive in the beginning of the fourteenth century, and which still yield 
a considerable revenue to the house of Brunswick.

chadless princess, Andronicus sought in marriage Jane, the sister of the 
count of Savoy; 20 and his suit was preferred to that of the French 
king. 21 The count respected in his sister the superior majesty of a 
Roman empress: her retinue was composed of knights and ladies; she 
was regenerated and crowned in St. Sophia under the more orthodox 
appellation of Anne; and, at the nuptial feast, the Greeks and Italians 
vied with each other in the martial exercises of tilts and tournaments. 
The empress Anne of Savoy survived her husband: their son, John 
Palseologus, was left an orphan and an emperor in the ninth year of his 
age; and his weakness was protected by the first and most deserving 
of the Greeks. The long and cordial friendship of his father for John 
Cantacuzene is alike honourable to the prince and the subject. It had 
been formed amidst the pleasures of their youth: their families were 
almost equally noble; 22 and the recent lustre of the purple was amply 
compensated by the energy of a private education. We have seen that 
the young emperor was saved by Cantacuzene from the power of his 
grandfather; and, after six years of civil war, the same favourite 
brought him back in triumph to the palace of Constantinople. Under 
the reign of Andronicus the younger, the great domestic ruled the em- 
peror and the empire; and it was by his valour and conduct that the 
isle of Lesbos and the principality of Mtolia were restored to their an- 
cient allegiance. His enemies confess that among the public robbers 
Cantacuzene alone was moderate and abstemious; and the free and 
voluntary account which he produces of his own wealth 23 may sustain 
the presumption that it was devolved by inheritance, and not accumu- 
lated by rapine. He does not indeed specify the value of his money, 
plate, and jewels, yet, after a voluntary gift of two hundred vases of 
silver, after much had been secreted by his friends and plundered by 
his foes, his forfeit treasures were sufficient for the equipment of a fleet 
of seventy galleys. He does not measure the size and number of his 
estates; but his granaries were heaped with an incredible store of wheat 
and barley; and the labour of a thousand yoke of oxen might culti- 
vate, according to the practice of antiquity, about sixty-two thousand 
Bve hundred acres of arable land. 24 His pastures were stocked with

90 Anne, or Jane, was one of the four daughters of Amedee the Great by 
a second marriage, and half sister of his successor Edward count of Savoy 
(Anderson's Tables, p. 650). See Cantacuzene (1. i. c. 40-42). 

That king, if the fact be true, must have been Charles the Fair, who in 
five years (1321-1326) was married to three wives (Anderson, p. 628) 
Anne of Savoy arrived at Constantinople in February 1326. 
The noble race of the Cantacuzeni (illustrious from the eleventh century 
in the Byzantine annals) was drawn from the Paladins of France the 
heroes of those romances which, in the thirteenth century, were translated 
and read by the Greeks (Ducange, Fam. Byzant. p. 258).

two thousand five hundred brood mares, two hundred camels, three 
hundred mules, five hundred asses, five thousand horned cattle, fifty 
thousand hogs, and seventy thousand sheep: 25 a precious record of 
rural opulence in the last period of the empire, and in a land, most 
probably in Thrace, so repeatedly wasted by foreign and domestic hos- 
tility. The favour of Cantacuzene was above his fortune. In the mo- 
ments of familiarity, in the hour of sickness, the emperor was desirous 
to level the distance between them, and pressed his friend to accept the 
diadem and purple. The virtue of the great domestic, which is attested 
t&gt;y his own pen, resisted the dangerous proposal; but the last testament 
of Andronicus the younger named him the guardian of his son, and the 
regent of the empire. 

Had the regent found a suitable return of obedience and gratitude,, 
perhaps he would have acted with pure and zealous fidelity in the serv- 
ice of his pupil. 26 A guard of five hundred soldiers watched over his 
person and the palace; the funeral of the kte emperor was decently 
performed, the capital was silent and submissive, and five hundred let- 
ters, which Cantacuzene despatched in the first month, informed the 
provinces of their loss and their duty. The prospect of a tranquil 
minority was blasted by the great duke or admiral Apocaucus; and to 
exaggerate his perfidy, the Imperial historian is pleased to magnify his 
own imprudence in raising him to that office against the advice of his 
more sagacious sovereign. Bold and subtle, rapacious and profuse, 
the avarice and ambition of Apocaucus were by turns subservient to 
*ach other, and his talents were applied to the ruin of his country. His 
arrogance was heightened by the command of a naval force and an im- 
pregnable castle, and under the mask of oaths and flattery he secretly 
conspired against his benefactor. The female court of the empress was 
bribed and directed; he encouraged Anne of Savoy to assert, by the 
law of nature, the tutelage of her son; the love of power was disguised 
by the anxiety of maternal tenderness; and the founder of the Palaeo- 
logi had instructed his posterity to dread the example of a perfidious 
guardian. The patriarch John of Apri was a proud and feeble old man, 
encompassed by a numerous and hungry kindred. He produced an 
obsolete epistle of Andronicus, which bequeathed the prince and people 
to his pious care: the fate of his predecessor Arsenius prompted him 
to prevent, rather than punish, the crimes of a usurper; and Apocaucus

Cousin is blotted with three palpable and essential errors, i. He omits 
the 1000 yoke of working oxen. 2. He interprets the verraritricu vpbv

smiled at the success of his own flattery when he beheld the Ryzanime 
priest assuming the state and temporal claims of the Roman pontiff. 27 
Between three persons so different in their station and character a Dri- 
vate league was concluded: a shadow of authority was restored to the 
senate, and the people was tempted by the name of freedom. By this 
powerful confederacy the great domestic was assaulted at first with 
clandestine, at length with open arms. His prerogatives were disputed, 
his opinions slighted, his friends persecuted, and his safety was threat- 
ened both in the camp and city. In his absence on the public service 
he was accused of treason, proscribed as art enemy of the church and 
state, and delivered, with all his. adherents, to the sword of justice, the 
vengeance of the people, and the power of the devil; his fortunes were 
confiscated, his aged mother was cast into prison, all his past services 
were buried in oblivion, and he was driven by injustice to perpetrate 
the crime of which he was accused. 28 From the. review of his preced- 
ing conduct, Cantacuzene appears to have been guiltless of any treason- 
able designs; and the only suspicion of his innocence must arise from 
the vehemence of his protestations, and the sublime purity which he 
ascribes to his own virtue. While the empress and the patriarch still 
affected the appearances of harmony, he repeatedly solicited the per- 
mission of retiring to a private, and even a monastic life. After he 
had been declared a public enemy it was his fervent wish to throw him- 
self at the feet of the young emperor, and to receive without a murmur 
the stroke of the executioner: it was not without reluctance that he 
listened to the voice of reason, which inculcated the sacred duty of 
saving his family and friends, and proved that he could only save them 
T)y drawing the sword and assuming the Imperial title. 

In the strong city of Demotica, his peculiar domain, the emperor 
John Cantacuzenus was invested with the purple buskins: his right leg 
was clothed by his noble kinsman, the left by the Lathi chiefs, on whom 
he conferred the order of knighthood. But even in this act of revolt 
he was still studious of loyalty; and the titles of John Palaeologus and 
Anne of Savoy were proclaimed before his own name and that of his 
wife Irene. Such vain ceremony is a thin disguise of rebellion; nor are 
there perhaps any personal wrongs that can authorise a subject to take 
arms against his sovereign: but the want of preparation and success 
may confirm the assurance of the usurper that this decisive step was 
the effect of necessity rather than of choice. Constantinople adhered 

87 He assumed the royal privilege of red shoes or buskins; placed on his 
head a mitre of sflk and gold ; subscribed his epistles with hyacinth or green- 
ink; and claimed for the new whatever Constantine had given to the ancient 
Rome (Cantacuzen.. L xii. c. 26 [torn. ii. p. 162, ed. Bonn] : Nic. Gregoras, 
Lxiv. 0.3).

to the young emperor; the king of Bulgaria was invited to the relief of 
Adrianople; the principal cities of Thrace and Macedonia, after some 
hesitation, renounced their obedience to the great domestic; and the 
leaders of the troops and provinces were induced by their private in- 
terest to prefer the loose dominion of a woman and a priest. The army 
of Cantacuzene, hi sixteen divisions, was stationed on the banks of the 
Melas to tempt or intimidate the capital: it was dispersed by treachery 
or fear, and the officers, more especially the mercenary Latins, accepted 
the bribes and embraced the service of the Byzantine court. After this 
loss, the rebel emperor (he fluctuated between the two characters) took 
the road to Thessalonica with a chosen remnant; but he failed in his 
enterprise on that important place; and he was closely pursued by the 
great duke, his enemy Apocaucus, at the head of a superior power by 
sea and land. Driven from the coast, in his march, or rather flight, 
into the mountains of Servia, Cantacuzene assembled his troops to 
scrutinise those who were worthy and willing to accompany his broken 
fortunes. A base majority bowed and retired; and his trusty band was 
diminished to two thousand, and at last to five hundred, volunteers. 
The crd, 2Q or despot of the Servians, received him with generous hos- 
pitality; but the ally was insensibly degraded to a suppliant, a hostage, 
a captive; and, in this miserable dependence, he waited at the door of 
the barbarian, who could dispose of the life and liberty of 'a Roman 
emperor. The most tempting offers could not persuade the oral to vio* 
late his trust; but he soon inclined to the stronger side, and his friend 
was dismissed without injury to a new vicissitude of hopes and perils. 
Near six years the flame of discord burnt with various success and un- 
abated rage; the cities were distracted by the faction of the nobles and 
the plebeians the Cantacuzeni and Palaeologi: and the Bulgarians, the 
Servians, and the Turks were invoked on both sides as the instruments 
of private ambition and the common ruin. The regent deplored the 
calamities of which he was the author and victim: and his own experi- 
ence might dictate a just and lively remark on the different nature of 
foreign and civil war. " The former," said he, " is the external warmth 
of summer, always tolerable, and often beneficial; the latter is the 
deadly heat of a fever, which consumes without a remedy the vitals 
of the constitution." * 

"The princes of Servia (Ducange, Famil. Dalmaticse, etc., c. 2, 3, 4, 9) were 
styled Despots in Greek, and Cral in their native idiom. (Ducange, Gloss. 
Grsec. p. 751.) That title, the equivalent of king, appears to be of Sclavonic 
origin, from whence it has been borrowed by the Hungarians, the modern 
Greeks, and even by the Turks (Leunclavius, Pandect. Turc. p. 422), who 
reserve the .name of Padishah for the emperor. To obtain the latter instead 
of the former is the ambition of the French at Constantinople (Avertissement 
a 1'Histoire de Timur Bee, p. 39).

derived from Caesar. O. S.] 

"Nic. Gregoras, 1. xii. c, 14 [torn. ii. p. 622, ed. Bonn]. It is surprising that 
Cantacuzene has not inserted this just and lively image in his own writings.

6i2 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

The introduction of barbarians and savages into the contests of civi- 
lised nations is a measure pregnant with shame and mischief, which the 
interest of the moment may compel, but which is reprobated by the 
best principles of humanity and reason. It is the practice of both sides 
to accuse their enemies of the guilt of the first alliances; and those who 
fail in their negotiations are loudest in their censure of the example 
which they envy and would gladly imitate. The Turks of Asia were 
less barbarous perhaps than the shepherds of Bulgaria and Servia, but 
their religion rendered them the implacable foes of Rome and Chris- 
tianity. To acquire the friendship of their emirs, the two factions vied 
with each other in baseness and profusion: the dexterity of Cantacu- 
zene obtained the preference: but the succour and victory were dearly 
purchased by the marriage of his daughter with an infidel, the captiv- 
ity of many thousand Christians, and the passage of the Ottomans into 
Europe, the last and fatal stroke in the fall of the Roman empire. The 
inclining scale was decided in his favour by the death of Apocaucus, 
the just though singular retribution of his crimes. A crowd of nobles 
or plebeians whom he feared or hated had been seized by his orders in 
the capital and the provinces, and the old palace of Constantine was 
assigned for the place of their confinement. Some alterations in rais- 
ing the walls and narrowing the cells had been ingeniously contrived to 
prevent their escape and aggravate their misery, and the work was in- 
cessantly pressed by the daily visits of the tyrant. His guards watched 
at the gate; and as he stood in the inner court to overlook the archi- 
tects, without fear or suspicion, he was assaulted and laid breathless 
on the ground by two resolute prisoners of the Palaeologian race, 81 who 
were armed with sticks and animated by despair. On the rumour of 
revenge and liberty, the captive multitude broke their fetters, fortified 

est power in the peninsula. Finlay says of him that his empire extended from 
(the Danube to the Gulf of Arta. " He was a man of great ambition, and was 
celebrated for his gigantic stature and personal courage. His subjects boasted 
of his liberality and success in war; his enemies reproached him with faith- 
lessness and cruelty. He had driven his father, Stephen VIL, from the throne, 
and the old man had been murdered in prison by the rebellious nobles of 
Servia, who feared lest a reconciliation should take place with his son. He 
then began to extend his conquests on all sides. To the east he rendered him- 
self master of the whole valley of the Strymon, took the large and flourishing 
city of Serres, and garrisoned all the fortresses as far as the wall that defended 
the pass of Christopolis. He then extended his dominions along the shores 
j&gt;f the Adriatic, and to the south he carried his arms as far as the Gulf of 
Ambracia. He subdued the Wallachians of Thessaly, and placed strong gar- 
risons in Achrida, Kastoria, and Joannina." Flushed with victory, he at last 
formed the ambitious scheme of depriving the Greeks of their political and 
ecclesiastical supremacy in the Eastern empire and transferring it to the 
Servian. He was crowned at Skopia in 1346 " Tzar of the Serbs and Greeks/' 
and gave his son the title of " kral "king. In a word, Stephan did for Servia 
what Yaroslav did for Russia. O. S.] 

81 The two avengers were both Palaeologi, who might resent, with royal 
indignation, the shame of their chains. The tragedy of Apocaucus may deserve 
a peculiar reference to Cantacuzene (1. iii. c. 88) and Nic. Grcgoras (1. xiv. 
c. 10).

their prison, and exposed from the battlements the tyrant's head, pre- 
suming on the favour of the people and the clemency of the empress. 
Anne of Savoy might rejoice in the fall of a haughty and ambitious 
minister; but while she delayed to resolve or to act, the populace, more 
especially the mariners, were excited by the widow of the great duke to 
a sedition, an assault, and a massacre. The prisoners (of whom the^far 
greater part were guiltless or inglorious of the deed) escaped to a neigh- 
bouring church: they were slaughtered at the foot of the altar; and in 
his death the monster was not less bloody and venomous than in his 
life. Yet his talents alone upheld the cause of the young emperor; and 
his surviving associates, suspicious of each other, abandoned the con- 
duct of the war, and rejected the fairest terms of accommodation. In 
the beginning of the dispute the empress felt and complained that she 
was deceived by the enemies of Cantacuzene: the patriarch was em- 
ployed to preach against the forgiveness of injuries; and her promise 
of immortal hatred was sealed by an oath under the penalty of excom- 
munication. 82 But Anne soon learned to hate without a teacher: she 
beheld the misfortunes of the empire with the indifference of a stran- 
ger; her jealousy was exasperated by the competition of a rival em- 
press; and on the first symptoms of a more yielding temper, she threat- 
ened the patriarch to convene a synod and degrade him from his office. 
Their incapacity and discord would have afforded the most decisive ad- 

88 Cantacuzene accuses the patriarch, and spares the empress, the mother 
of his sovereign (1. iii. 33, 34), against whom NIC, Gregoras expresses a 
particular animosity (L xiv. 10, n; xv. 5). It is true that they do not 
speak exactly of the same time. 

[It is well that the reader should know what exactly is meant by the 
term " The Greek Empire." Finlay gives us the following excellent resum$: 
"The Greek empire consisted of several detached provinces when Canta- 
cuzenos seated himself on the throne, and the inhabitants of these different 
parts could only communicate freely by sea. The nucleus of the imperial 
power consisted of the city of Constantinople and the greater part of 
Thrace. On the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus the Greek possessions con- 
sisted of the suburb Skutari, a few forts, and a narrow strip of coast 
running from Chalcedon to the Black Sea. In Thrace the frontier extended 
from Sozopolis along the mountains to the south-west, passing about a 
day's journey to the north of Adrianople, and descending to the &gt;Egean Sea 
at the pass and fortress of Christopolis. It included the districts of 
Morrah and the Thracian Chalkidike. The second portion of the empire 
in importance consisted of the rich and populous city of Thessalonica, 
with the western part of the Macedonian Chalkidike and its three peninsulas 
of Cassandra, Longos, and Agionoros. The third detached portion of the 
empire consisted of a part of Wallachian Thessaly and of Albanian Epirus, 
which formed a small province interposed between the Servian empire and 
the Catalan Duchy of Athens and Neopatras. The fourth detached part 
consisted of the Greek province in the Peloponnesus, which obtained the 
name of the Despotat of Misithra, and embraced about one-third of the 
peninsula. The remaining fragments of the empire consisted of a few 
islands in the JEgean Sea, which had escaped the domination of the Vene- 
tians, the Genoese, and the Knights of St. John, and of the cities of Phila- 
delphia and Phocaea, which still recognised the suzerainty of Constantinople.

vantage; but the civil war was protracted by the weakness of both 
parties; and the moderation of Cantacuzene has not escaped the re- 
proach of timidity and indolence. He successively recovered the prov- 
inces and cities; and the realm of his pupil was measured by the walls 
of Constantinople; but the metropolis alone counterbalanced the rest 
of the empire; nor could he attempt that important conquest till he 
had secured in his favour the public voice and a private correspondence. 
An Italian, of the name of Facciolati, 83 had succeeded to the office of 
great duke: the ships, the guards, and the golden gate were subject to 
his command; but his humble ambition was bribed to become the in- 
strument of treachery; and the revolution was accomplished without 
danger or bloodshed. Destitute of the powers of resistance or the hope 
of relief, the inflexible Anne would have still defended the palace, and 
have smiled to behold the capital in flames rather than in the posses- 
sion of a rival. She yielded to the prayers of her friends and enemies, 
and the treaty was dictated by the conqueror, who professed a loyal and 
zealous attachment to the son of his benefactor. The marriage of his 
daughter with John Palseologus was at length consummated; the heredi- 
tary right of the pupil was acknowledged, but the sole administration 
during ten years was vested in the guardian. Two emperors and three 
empresses were seated on the Byzantine throne; and a general amnesty 
quieted the apprehensions and confirmed the property of the most 
guilty subjects. The festival of the coronation and nuptials was cele- 
brated with the appearances of concord and magnificence, and both 
were equally fallacious. During the late troubles the treasures of the 
state, and even the furniture of the palace, had been alienated or em^ 
bezzled; the royal banquet was served in pewter or earthenware; and 
such was the proud poverty of the times, that the absence of gold and 
jewels was supplied by the paltry artifices of glass and gilt leather. 8 * 
I hasten to conclude the personal history of John Cantacuzene. 85 
He triumphed and reigned; but his reign and triumph were clouded 
by the discontent of his own and the adverse faction. His followers 
might style the general amnesty an act of pardon for his enemies, and 
of oblivion for his friends: in his cause their estates had been forfeited 
or plundered; and as they wandered naked and hungry through the 
streets, they cursed the selfish generosity of a leader who, on the throne

of the empire, might relinquish without merit his private inheritance. 38 
The adherents of the empress blushed to hold their lives and fortunes 
by the precarious favour of a usurper, and the thirst of revenge was 
concealed by a tender concern for the succession, and even the safety, 
of her son. They were justly alarmed by a petition of the friends of 
Cantacuzene, that they might be released from their oath of allegiance 
to the Palaologi, and intrusted with the defence of some cautionary 
towns; a measure supported with argument and eloquence, and which 
was rejected (says the Imperial historian) " by my sublime and almost 
incredible virtue." His repose was disturbed by the sound of plots and 
seditions, and he trembled lest the lawful prince should be stolen away 
by some foreign or domestic enemy, who would inscribe his name and 
his wrongs in the banners of rebellion. As the son of Andronicus ad- 
vanced in the years of manhood he began to feel and to act for himself, 
and his rising ambition was rather stimulated than checked by the imi- 
tation of his father's vices. If we may trust his own professions, Can- 
tacuzene laboured with honest industry to correct these sordid and 
sensual appetites, and to raise the mind of the young prince to a level 
with his fortune. In the Servian -expedition the two emperors showed 
themselves in cordial harmony to the troops and provinces, and the 
younger colleague was initiated by the elder in the mysteries of war and 
government. After the conclusion of the peace, Palaeologus was left at 
Thessalonica, a royal residence and a frontier station, to secure by his 
absence the peace of Constantinople, and to withdraw his youth from 
the temptations of a luxurious capital. But the distance weakened the 
powers of control, and the son of Andronicus was surrounded with art* 
f ul or unthinking companions, who taught him to hate his guardian, ta 
deplore his exile, and to vindicate his rights. A private treaty with the 
cral or despot of Servia was soon followed by an open revolt; and 
Cantacuzene, on the throne of the elder Andronicus, defended the cause 
of age and prerogative, which in his youth he had so vigorously at- 
tacked. At his request the empress-mother undertook the voyage of 
ThessaJonica and the office of mediation: she returned without success; 
and unless Anne of Savoy was instructed by adversity, we may doubt 
the sincerity, or at least the fervour, of her zeal. While the regent 
grasped the sceptre with a firm and vigorous hand, she had been in- 
structed to declare that the ten years of his legal administration would 
soon elapse; and that, after a full trial of the vanity of the world, the 
emperor Cantacuzene sighed for the repose of a doister, and was am- 
bitious only of a heavenly crown. Had these sentiments been genuine, 
his voluntary abdication would have restored the peace of the empire, 
and his conscience would have been relieved by an act of justice. Pa- 
laeologus alone was responsible for his future government; and what-

ever might be his vices, they were surely less formidable than the ca- 
lamities of a civil war, in which the barbarians and infidels were again 
invited to assist the Greeks in their mutual destruction. By the arms 
of the Turks, who now struck a deep and everlasting root in Europe, 
Cantacuzene prevailed in the third contest in which he had been in- 
volved, and the young emperor, driven from the sea and land, was com- 
pelled to take shelter among the Latins of the isle of Tenedos. His in- 
solence and obstinacy provoked the victor to a step which must render 
the quarrel irreconcilable; and the association of his son Matthew, 
whom he invested with the purple, established the succession in the 
family of the Cantacuzeni. But Constantinople was still attached to 
the blood of her ancient princes, and this last injury accelerated the 
restoration of the rightful heir. A noble Genoese espoused the cause 
of Palaeologus, obtained a promise of his sister, and achieved the revo- 
lution with two galleys and two thousand five hundred auxiliaries. 
Under the pretence of distress they were admitted into the lesser port; 
a gate was opened, and the Lathi shout of " Long life and victory to 
the emperor John Palseologus! " was answered by a general rising in 
his favour. A numerous and loyal party yet adhered to the standard 
of Cantacuzene; but he asserts in his history (does he hope for belief?) 
that his tender conscience rejected the assurance of conquest; that, in 
free obedience to the voice of religion and philosophy, he descended 
from the throne, and embraced with pleasure the monastic habit and 
profession. 87 So soon as he ceased to be a prince, his successor was not 
unwilling that he should be a saint; the remainder of his life was de- 
voted to piety and learning; in the cells of Constantinople and Mount 
Athos the monk Joasaph was respected as the temporal and spiritual 
father of the emperor; and if he issued from his retreat, it was as the 
minister of peace, to subdue the obstinacy and solicit the pardon of 
his rebellious son. 38 

Yet in the cloister the mind of Cantacuzene was still exercised by 
theological war. He sharpened a controversial pen against the Jews 
and Mohammedans; 89 and in every state he defended with equal zeal 
the divine light of Mount Thabor, a memorable question which con- 

*The awkward apology of Cantacuzene (L iv. c. 39-42), who relates, with 
visible confusion, his own downfall, may be supplied by the less accurate, 
but more honest, narratives of Matthew Villani (1. iv. c. 46, in the Script 
Rerum Ital. torn, xiv. p. 268) and Ducas (c. 10, n). 

*Cantacuzeae, in the vear 1375, was honoured with a letter from the 
pope (Fleury, Hist. Eccles. torn. xx. p. 250). His death is placed by a 
respectable authority on the20th of November, 1411 (Ducange, Fam. Byzant 
p. 260). But if he were of the age of his companion Andronicus tihe 
Younger, he^mtist have lived 116 years a rare instance of longevity, which 
m so _ illustrious a person would have attracted universal notice. 

"His four discourses, or books, were printed at Basil 1543 (Fabric. 
Bibkoth. Graec. torn. vi. p. 473). He composed them to satisfy a proselyte 
who was assaulted with letters from his friends of Ispahan. Cantacuzene 
had read the Koran; but I understand from Maracci that he adopts the" 
vulgar prejudices and fables against Mohammed and his religion. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 6il 

summates the religious follies of the Greeks. The fakirs of India 40 
and the monks of the Oriental church were alike persuaded that, in 
total abstraction of the faculties of the mind and body, the purer spirit 
may ascend to the enjoyment and vision of the Deity. The opinion and 
practice of the monasteries of Mount Athos 41 will be best represented 
in the words of an abbot who flourished in the eleventh century. 
" When thou art alone in thy cell," says the ascetic teacher, " shut thy 
door, and seat thyself in a corner: raise thy mind above all things vain 
and transitory; recline thy beard and chin on thy breast; turn thy eyes 
and thy thought towards the middle of thy belly, the region of the 
naval; and search the place of the heart, the seat of the soul. At first 
all will be dark and comfortless; but if you persevere day and night, 
you will fed an ineffable joy; and no sooner has the soul discovered 
the place of the heart, than it is involved in a mystic and etherial 
light." This light, the production of a distempered fancy, the creature 
of an empty stomach and an empty brain, was adored by the Quietists 
as the pure and perfect essence of God himself; and as long as the folly 
was confined to Mount Athos, the simple solitaries were not inquisitive 
how the divine essence could be a material substance, or how an imma- 
terial substance could be perceived by the eyes of the body. But in 
the reign of the younger Andronicus these monasteries were visited by 
Barlaam, 42 a Calabrian monk, who was equally skilled in philosophy 
and theology, who possessed the languages of the Greeks and Latins, 
and whose versatile genius could maintain their opposite creeds, ac- 
cording to the interest of the moment. The indiscretion of an ascetic 
revealed to the curious traveller the secrets of mental prayer; and Bar- 
laam embraced the opportunity of ridiculing the Quietists, who placed 
the soul in the naval; of accusing the monks of Mount Athos of heresy 
and blasphemy. His attack compelled the more learned to renounce 
or dissemble the simple devotion of their brethren, and Gregory Pala- 
mas introduced a scholastic distinction between the essence and opera- 
.tion of God. His inaccessible essence dwells in the midst of an uncre- 
ated and eternal light; and this beatific vision of the saints had been 
manifested to the disciples on Mount Thabor in the transfiguration of 
Christ. Yet this distinction could not escape the reproach of polythe- 
ism; the eternity of the light of Thabor was fiercely dejiied, and Bar- 
laam still charged the Palamites with holding two eternal substances, 
a visible and an invisible God. From the rage of the monks of Mount 
Athos, who threatened his life, the Calabrian retired to Constantinople,

where his smooth and specious manners introduced him to the favour 
of the great domestic and the emperor. The court and the city were in- 
volved in this theological dispute, which flamed amidst the civil war; 
but the doctrine of Barlaam was disgraced by his flight and apostacy; 
the Palamites triumphed; and their adversary, the patriarch John of 
Apri, was deposed by the consent of the adverse factions of the state. 
In the character of emperor and theologian, Cantacuzene presided in 
the synod of the Greek church, which established, as an article of faith, 
the uncreated light of Mount Thabor: and, after so many insults, the 
reason of mankind was slightly wounded by the addition of a single 
absurdity. Many rolls of paper or parchment have been blotted; and 
the impenitent sectaries, who refused to subscribe the orthodox creed, 
were deprived of the honours of Christian burial; but in the next age 
the question was forgotten, nor can I learn that the axe or the faggot 
were employed for the extirpation of the Barlaamite heresy. 43 

For the conclusion of this chapter I have reserved the Genoese war, 
which shook the throne of Cantacuzene and betrayed the debility of the 
Greek empire. The Genoese, who, after the recovery of Constanti- 
nople, were seated in the suburb of Pera or Galata, received that hon- 
ourable fief from the bounty of the emperor. They were indulged in 
the use of their laws and magistrates, but they submitted to the duties 
of vassals and subjects; the .forcible word of liegemen** was borrowed 
from the Latin jurisprudence, and their podesti, or chief, before he en- 
tered on his office, saluted the emperor with loyal acclamations and 
vows of fidelity. Genoa sealed a firm alliance with the Greeks; and, 
in the case of a defensive war, a supply of fifty 'empty galleys, and a 
succour of fifty galleys completely armed and manned, was promised 
by the republic to the empire. In the revival of a naval force it was 
the aim of Michael Palaeologus to deliver himself from a foreign aid;' 
and his vigorous government contained the Genoese of Galata within 
those limits which the insolence of wealth and freedom provoked them 
to exceed. A sailor threatened that they should soon be masters of 
Constantinople, and slew the Greek who resented this national affront; 
and an armed vessel, after refusing to salute the palace, was guilty of 
some acts of piracy in the Black Sea. Their countrymen threatened to 
support their cause: but the long and open, village of Galata was in- 
stantly surrounded by the Imperial troops; till&gt; in the moment of the 
assault, the prostrate Genoese implored the clemency of their sovereign.

THE ROMAN EMPIRE 619 

The defenceless situation which secured their obedience exposed them to 
the attack of their Venetian rivals, who, in the reign of the elder An- 
dronicus, presumed to violate the majesty of the throne. On the ap- 
proach of their fleets, the Genoese, with their families and effects, re- 
tired into the city; their empty habitations were reduced to ashes; and 
the feeble prince, who had viewed the destruction of his suburb, ex- 
pressed his resentment, not by arms, but by ambassadors. This mis- 
fortune, however, was advantageous to the Genoese, who obtained, and 
imperceptibly abused, the dangerous licence of surrounding Galata 
with a strong wall, of introducing into the ditch the waters of the sea, 
of erecting lofty turrets, and of mounting a train of military engines 
on the rampart. The narrow bounds in which they had been circum- 
scribed were insufficient for the growing colony; each day they acquired 
some addition of landed property, and the adjacent hills were covered 
with their villas and castles, which they joined and protected by new 
fortifications. 45 The navigation and trade of the Euxine was the patri- 
mony of the Greek emperors, who commanded the narrow entrance, 
the gatesj as it were, of that inland sea. In the reign of Michael Pa- 
laeologus their prerogative was acknowledged by the sultan of Egypt, 
who solicited and obtained the liberty of sending an annual ship for 
the purchase of slaves in Circassia and the Lesser Tartary: a liberty 
pregnant with mischief to the Christian cause, since these youths were 
transformed by education and discipline into the formidable Mama- 
lukes.* From the colony of Pera the Genoese engaged with superior 
advantage in the lucrative trade of the Black Sea, and their industry 
supplied the Greeks with fish and corn, two articles of food almost 
equally important to a superstitious people. The spontaneous ^bounty 
of nature appears to have bestowed the harvests of the Ukraine, the 
produce of a rude and savage husbandry; and the endless exportation 
of salt-fish and caviar is annually renewed by the enormous sturgeons 
that are caught at the mouth of the Don or Tanais, in their last station 
of the rich mud and shaJlow water of the Mseotis. 47 The waters of the 
Qxus, the Caspian, the Volga, and the Don opened a rare and laborious 
passage for the gems and spices of India ; and after three months' march 

45 The establishment and progress of the Genoese at Pera, or Galata, is 
described by Ducange (C. P. Christiana, 1. i p. 68, 69) from the Byzantine 
historians, Pachymer (1. ii. c. 35? L *. *, 30; L ix. 15; L HI. 6, 9), Nice- 
phorus Gregoras {1. v. -c. 4; 1. vi c. n ; 1. ix. c. 5; L xi. c. i; 1. xv. c. i, 6), 
and Cantacuzene (L L c. 12; L ii. c. 29, etc.). m

children of Zingis the permission to build a stately mosque in the capital 
of Crimea (Be Guignes, Hist, des Huns, torn. iii. p. 343)- 

^Chardin (Voyages en Perse, torn. i. p. 48) was assured at Caffa that 
these fishes were sometimes twenty-four or twenty-six feet long, weighed

the caravans of Carizme met the Italian vessels in the harbours of 
Crimea. 48 These various branches of trade were monopolised by the 
diligence and power of the Genoese. Their rivals of Venice and Pisa 
were forcibly expelled; the natives were awed by the castles and cities 
which arose on the foundations of their humble factories; and their 
principal establishment of CaJfa 40 was besieged without effect by the 
Tartar powers. Destitute of a navy, the Greeks were oppressed by 
these haughty merchants, who fed or famished Constantinople accord- 
ing to their interest. They proceeded to usurp the customs, the fishery, 
and even the toll, of the Bosphorus; and while they derived from these 
objects a revenue of two hundred thousand pieces of gold, a remnant 
of thirty thousand was reluctantly allowed to the emperor. 50 The col- 
ony of Pera or Galata acted, in peace and war, as an independent 
state; and, as it will happen in distant settlements, the Genoese po- 
desta too often forgot that he was the servant of his own masters. 

These usurpations were encouraged by the weakness of the elder 
Andronicus, and by the civil wars that afflicted his age and the minority 
of his grandson. The talents of Cantacuzene were employed to the 
ruin, rather than the restoration, of the empire; and after his domestic 
victory he was condemned to an ignominious trial, whether the Greeks 
or the Genoese should reign in Constantinople. The merchants of 
Pera were offended by his refusal of some contiguous lands, some com- 
manding heights, which they proposed to cover with new fortifications; 
and in the absence of the emperor, who was detained at Damotica by 
sickness, they ventured to brave the debility of a female reign. A 
Byzantine vessel, which had presumed to fish at the mouth of the har- 
bour, was sunk by these audacious strangers; the fishermen were mur- 
dered. Instead of suing for pardon, the Genoese demanded satisfac- 
tion; required, in a haughty strain, that the Greeks should renounce 
the exercise of navigation; and encountered with regular arms the first 
sallies of the popular indignation. They instantly occupied the debat- 
able land; and by the labour of a whole people, of eitner sex and of 
every age, the wall was raised, and the ditch was sunk, with incredible 
speed. At the same time they attacked and burnt two Byzantine gal- 
leys; while the three others, the remainder of the Imperial navy, 
escaped from their hands: the habitations without the gates, or along 
the shore, were pillaged and destroyed; and the care of the regent, of 
the empress Irene, was confined to the preservation of the city. The 
return of Cantacuzene dispelled the public consternation: the emperor 
inclined to peaceful counsels; but he yielded to the obstinacy of his

when Tartary was united under a wise and powerful monarch. 

48 Nic. Gregoras (1. xiii. c. 12) is judicious and well-informed on the trade 
and colonies of the Black Sea. Chardin describes the present ruins of 
Caffa, where, in forty days, he saw above 400 sail employed n the corn and 
fish trade (Voyages en Perse, torn. i. p. 46-48).

enemies, who rejected all reasonable terms, and to the ardour of his 
subjects, who threatened, in the style of Scripture, to break them in 
pieces like a potter's vessel. Yet they reluctantly paid the taxes that 
he imposed for the construction of ships, and the expenses of the war; 
and as the two nations were masters, the one of the land, the other of 
the sea, Constantinople and Pera were pressed by the evils of a mutual 
siege. The merchants of the colony, who had believed that a few days 
would terminate the war, already murmured at their losses: the suc- 
cours from their mother-country were delayed by the factions of 
Genoa; and the most cautious embraced the opportunity of a Rhodiau 
vessel to remove their families and effects from the scene of hostility. 
In the spring, the Byzantine fleet, seven galleys and a train of smaller 
vessels, issued from the mouth of the harbour, and steered in a single 
line along the shore of Pera; unskilfully presenting their sides to the 
beaks of the adverse squadron. The crews were composed of peasants 
and mechanics; nor was their ignorance compensated by the native 
courage of barbarians: the wind was strong, the waves were rough; 
and no sooner did the Greeks perceive a distant and inactive enemy, 
than they leaped headlong into the sea, from a doubtful, to an inevi- 
table, peril. The troops that marched to the attack of the lines of 
Pera were struck at the same moment with a similar panic; and the 
Genoese were astonished, and almost ashamed, at their'double victory. 
Their triumphant vessels, crowned with flowers, and dragging after 
them the captive galleys, repeatedly passed and repassed before the 
palace: the only virtue of the empero* -tfas patience; and the hope of 
revenge his sole consolation. Set the distress of both parties inter- 
posed a temporary agreement; and the shame of the empire was dis- 
guised by a thin vein of dignity and power. Summoning the chiefs of 
the colony, Cantacuzene affected to despise the trivial object of the de- 
bate; and, after a mild reproof, most liberally granted the lands, which 
had been previously resigned to the seeming custody of his officers. 51 
But the emperor was soon solicited to violate the treaty, and to join 
his arms with the Venetians, the perpetual enemies of Genoa and her 
colonies. While he compared the reasons of peace and war, his mod- 
eration was provoked by a wanton insult of the inhabitants of Pera, 
who discharged from their rampart a large stone that fell in the midst 
of Constantinople. On his just complaint, they coldly blamed the im- 
prudence of their engineer; but the next day the insult was repeated; 
and they exulted in a second proof that the royal city was not beyond 
the reach of their artillery. Cantacuzene instantly signed his treaty 
with the Venetians; but the weight of the Roman empire was scarcely 
felt in the balance of these opulent and powerful republics. 82 From the 



events of this war are related by Cantacuzene (L iv. c. n) with 
obscurity and confusion, and by Nic. Gregoras (1. xvii. c. 1-7) in a clear 
and honest narrative. The priest was less responsible than the prince for

straits of Gibraltar to .the mouth of the Tanais, their fleets encountered 
each other with various success; and a memorable battle was fought 
in the narrow sea, under the walls of Constantinople. It would not be 
an easy task to reconcile the accounts of the Greeks, the Venetians, and 
the Genoese; 68 and while I depend on the narrative of an impartial his- 
torian, 54 I shall borrow from each nation the facts that redound to 
their own disgrace and the honour of their foes. The Venetians, with 
their allies the Catalans, had the advantage of number; and their fleet, 
with the poor addition of eight Byzantine galleys, amounted to seventy- 
five sail: the Genoese did not exceed sixty-four; but in those times their 
ships of war .were distinguished by the superiority of their size and 
strength. The. names and families of their naval commanders, Pisani 
and Doria, are illustrious in the annals of their country; but the per- 
sonal merit of the former was eclipsed by the fame and abilities of his 
rival. They engaged in tempestuous weather; and the tumultuary con- 
flict was continued from the dawn to the extinction of light. The ene- 
mies of the Genoese applaud their prowess; the friends of the Venetians 
are dissatisfied with their behaviour; but all parties agree in praising 
the skill and boldness of the Catalans, who, with many wounds, sus- 
tained the brunt of the action. On the separation of the fleets, the 
event might appear doubtful; but the thirteen Genoese galleys that had 
.been sunk or taken were compensated by a double loss of the allies; 
of fourteen Venetians, ten Catalans, and two Greeks; and even the grief 
of the conquerors expressed the assurance and habit of more decisive 
victories. Pisani confessed his defeat by .retiring into a fortified har- 
bour, from whence, under the pretext of the orders of the senate, he 
steered with a broken and flying squadron for the isle of Candia, and 
abandoned to his rivals the sovereignty of the sea. In a public epis- 
.tle, 5B addressed to the doge and senate, Petrarch employs his eloquence 
to reconcile the maritime powers, the two luminaries of Italy. The 
orator celebrates the valour and victory of the Genoese, the first of 
men in the exercise of naval war: he drops a tear on the misfortunes 
of their Venetian brethren; but he .exhorts them to pursue with fire and 
sword the base and perficlious Greeks; to purge the metropolis of the 
East from the heresy with which it was infected. Deserted by their

friends, the Greeks were incapable of resistance; and three months 
after the battle the emperor Cantacuzene solicited and subscribed 
treaty, which for ever banished the Venetians and Catalans, and 
granted to the Genoese a monopoly of trade, and almost a right of do- 
minion. The Roman Empire (I smile in transcribing the name) might- 
soon have sunk into a province of Genoa, if the ambition of the republic 
had not been checked by the ruin of her freedom and naval power. A 
long contest of one hundred and thirty years was determined by the 
triumph of Venice; and the factions of the Genoese compelled 'them to 
seek for domestic peace under the protection of a foreign lord, the duke 
of Milan, or the French king. Yet the spirit of commerce survived 
that of conquest; and the colony of Pera still awed the capital and 
navigated the Euxine, till it was involved by the Turks in the final 
servitude of Constantinople itself.

FROM the petty quarrels of a city and her suburbs, from the cowardice 
and discord of the falling Greeks, I shall now ascend to the victorious 
Turks; whose domestic slavery was ennobled by martial discipline^ re- 
ligious enthusiasm, and the energy of the national character. The rise 
and progress of the Ottomans, the present sovereigns of Constantinople, 
are connected with the most important scenes of modern history; but 
they are founded on a previous knowledge of the great eruption of the 
Moguls and Tartars, whose rapid conquests may be compared with the 
primitive convulsions of nature, which have agitated and altered the 
surface of the globe. I have long since asserted my daim to introduce 
the nations, the immediate or remote authors of the fall of the Roman 
empire; nor can I refuse myself to those events which, from their un- 
common magnitude, will interest a philosophic mind in the history of 
blood. 1 

l The reader is invited to review chapters xxiL to xxvi. and xxxiii. to 
xxxviii., the manners of pastoral nations, the conquests of Attila and the 
Huns, which were composed at a time when I entertained the wish, rather 
than the hope, of concluding my history. 

[In these volumes the names Moguls (or Mongols), Tartars, and Turks 
are frequently used indiscriminately, but it may be well to affirm again 
what has been stated again and again, that the Tartars (or Tatars) were 
probably a Mongolian tribe which occupied so conspicuous a place in the 
army of Zenghis Khan that their name was given to the whole race. The 
Turks are one of the most numerous of the families of the world, and almost 
all the nomad Asiatic tribes that devastated Europe from the fourth to the 



624 THE DECLINE AND FALJL OF 

From the spacious highlands between China, Siberia, and the Cas- 
pian Sea the tide of emigration and war has repeatedly been poured. 
These ancient seats of the Huns and Turks were occupied in the twelfth 
century by many pastoral tribes, of the same descent and similar man- 
ners, which were united and led to conquest by the formidable Zingis. 
In his ascent to greatness that barbarian (whose private appellation was 
Temugin) had trampled on the necks of his equals. His birth was 
noble; but it was in the pride of victory that the prince or people de- 
duced his seventh ancestor from the immaculate conception of a vir- 
gin. His father had reigned over thirteen hordes, which composed 
about thirty or forty thousand families: above two-thirds refused to pay 
tithes or obedience to his infant son; and at the age of thirteen Temugin 
fought a battle against his rebellious subjects. The future conqueror 
of Asia was reduced to fly and to obey; but he rose superior to his for- 
tune, and in his fortieth year he had established his fame and dominion 
over the circumjacent tribes. In a state of society in which policy is 
rude and valour is universal, the ascendant of one man must be founded 
on his power and resolution to punish his enemies and recompense his 
friends. His first military league was ratified by the simple rites of sac- 
rificing a horse and tasting of a running stream: Temugin pledged him- 
self to divide with his followers the sweets and the bitters of life; and 
when he had shared among them his horses and apparel, he was rich 
in their gratitude and his own hopes. After his first victory he placed 
seventy caldrons on the fire, and seventy of the most guilty rebels were 
cast headlong into the boiling water. The sphere of his attraction was 
continually enlarged by the ruin of the proud and the submission of the 
prudent; and the boldest chieftains might tremble when they beheld, 
enchased in silver, the skull of the khan of the Keraites; 2 who, under 
the name of Prester John, had corresponded with the Roman pontiff and 
the princes of Europe. The ambition of Temugin condescended to em- 
ploy the arts of superstition; and it was from a naked prophet, who 
could ascend to heaven on a white horse, that he accepted the title of 
Zingis, 8 the most great; and a divine right to the conquest and dominion 

twelfth centuries belonged to this race the Huns, Chazars, Avars, Bul- 
garians, Petcheneges, and Comanians, were all Turks. The only Asiatic 
invaders who were not so were the Hungarians, or the Magyars, and they 
were a Finnish or Tschudish people. 0. S.] 

8 The khans of the Keraites were most probably incapable of reading the 
pompous epistles composed in their name by the Nestorian missionaries, 
who endowed them with the fabulous wonders of an Indian kingdom,-. 
Perhaps these Tartars (the Presbyter or Priest John) had submitted to the 
rites of baptism and ordination (Asseman. Biblioth. Orient, torn. iii. p. ii. 

P- 487-503). 

[The fact is now pretty definitely established that the Keraites were not 
a Mongol but a Turkish race, whose territory lay near the Upper Orchon, 
l&gt;etween the rivers Selinga and Kernlen. They were a Christian race, 
having been converted early in the eleventh century. 0. S.] 

s Since the history and tragedy of Voltaire, Gengis, at least in French, 
seems to be the more fashionable spelling; but Abulghazi Khan must have 
known the true name of his ancestor. His etymology appears just: 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 625 

of the earth. In a general couroidtai, or diet, he was seated on a^feltj 
which was long afterwards revered as a relic, and solemnly proclaimed 
great khaii or emperor of the Moguls 4 and Tartars. 5 Of these kindred, 
though rival, names, the former had given birth to the imperial race, 
and the latter has been extended by accident or error over the spacious 
wilderness of the north. 

The code of laws which Zingis dictated to his subjects was adapted 
to the preservation of domestic peace and the exercise of foreign hos- 
tility. The punishment of death was inflicted on the crimes of adultery, 
murder, perjury, and the capital thefts of a horse or ox; and the fiercest 
of men were mild and just in their intercourse with each other. The 
future election of the great khan was vested in the princes of his family 
and the heads of the tribes; and the regulations of the chase were essen- 
tial to the pleasures and plenty of a Tartar camp. The victorious nation 
was held sacred from all servile labours, which were abandoned to slaves 
and strangers; and every labour was servile except the profession of 
arms. The service and discipline of the troops, who were armed with 
bows, scimitars, and iron maces, and divided by hundreds, thousands, 
and ten thousands, were the institutions of a veteran commander. Each 
officer and soldier was made responsible, under pain of death, for the 
safety and honour of his companions; and the spirit of conquest breathed 
in the law that peace should never be granted unless to a vanquished and 
suppliant enemy. But it is the religion of Zingis that best deserves our 
wonder and applause. The Catholic inquisitors of Europe, who de- 
fended nonsense by cruelty, might have been confounded by the example 
of a barbarian, who anticipated the lessons of philosophy, 6 and estab- 
lished by his laws a system of pure theism and perfect toleration. His 
first and only article of faith was the existence of one God, the Author 
of all good, who fills by his presence the heavens and earth, which he 

in the Mogul tongue, signifies great, and gis is the superlative termination 
(Hist. GSn6alogique des Tatars, part iii. p. 194 195). From the same idea 
of magnitude the appellation of Zingis is bestowed on the ocean. 

*The name of Moguls has prevailed among the Orientals, and still 
adheres to the titular sovereign, the Great Mogul of Hindostan. 

*The Tartars (more properly Tatars) were descended from Tatar Khan, 
the brother of Mogul Khan (see Abulghazi, parts i. and ii.), and once 
formed a horde of 70,000 families on the borders of Kitay (p. 103-112). In 
the great invasion of Europe (A.D. 1238) they seem to have led the van- 
guard; and the similitude of the name of Tartarei recommended that of 
Tartars to the Latins (Matt. Paris, p. 398 [p. 546, ed. Lond. 1640], etc.). 

*A singular conformity may be found between the religious ^ laws of 
Zingis Khan and of Mr. Locke (Constitutions of -Carolina, in his works, 
vol. iv. p. 535, 4to edition, 1777). ^ , . ,_ 

[Before his armies entered Tibet, Zenghis Khan sent an embassy to 
Bogdosott-nam-Dsimmo, a Lama high priest, with a letter to this effect: 
"I have chosen thee as high priest for myself and _ my empire. Repair^then 
to me, and promote the present and future happiness of man. I will be 
thy supporter and protector. Let us establish a system of religion, and 
unite it with the monarchy." The high priest accepted the invitation, and 
Mongol historians term this epoch "The Period of the First Respect for 
Religion." O. S.] 



626 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

has created by his power. The Tartars and Moguls were addicted to 
the idols of their peculiar tribes; and many of them had been converted 
by the foreign missionaries to the religions of Moses, of Mohammed, 
and of Christ. These various systems in freedom and concord were 
taught and practised within the precincts of the same camp; and the 
Bonze, the Imam, the Rabbi, the Nestorian, and the Latin priest, en- 
joyed the same honourable exemption from service and tribute: in the 
mosque of Bochara the insolent victor might trample the Koran under 
his horse's feet, but the calm legislator respected the prophets and 
pontiffs of the most hostile sects. The reason of Zingis was not informed 
by books: the khan could neither read nor write; and, except the tribe 
of the Igours, the greatest part of the Moguls and Tartars were as illit- 
erate as their sovereign. The memory of their exploits was preserved 
by tradition: sixty-eight years after the death of Zingis these traditions 
were collected and transcribed; 7 the brevity of their domestic annals 
may be supplied by the Chinese,* Persians, Armenians, 10 Syrians, 11 

'In the year 1294, by the command of Cazan, khan of Persia, the fourth 
in descent from Zingis. From these traditions his ^ vizir Fadlallah com- 
posed a Mogul history in the Persian language, which has been used by 
Petit de la Croix (Hist, de Genghfzcan, p. 537-539). The Histoire Genea- 
logique des Tatars (i Leyde, 1726, in I2tno, 2 tomes) was translated by 
the Swedish prisoners in Siberia from the Mogul MS. of Abulgasi Bahadur 
Khan, a descendant of Zingis, who reigned over the Usbeks of Charasm, or 
Carizme (AJ&gt;. 1644-1663). He is of most value and credit for the names, 
pedigrees, and manners of his nation. Of his nine parts, the first descends 
from Adam to Mogul Khan; the second, from Mogul to Zingis; the third 
is the life of Zingis; the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh, the general 
history of his four sons and their posterity; the eighth and ninth, the 
particular history of the descendants of Sheibani Khan, who reigned in 
Maurenahar and Charasm. 

[The Igours (or more correctly Ouigours) were Turks, not Mongols. The 
Ouigour minister of Zenghis, Tha-tha-toung-o, was said to be the instructor 
of the Mongols in writing, of which they were ignorant previously. The 
Ouigour alphabet or characters, therefore, cannot be placed earlier than 
1204-1205, nor later than Khubilai. 0. S.]

The arms of Zingis and his lieutenants successively reduced the hordes 
of the desert, who pitched their tents between the wall of China and the 
Volga; and the Mogul emperor became the monarch of the pastoral 
world, the lord of many millions of shepherds and soldiers, who felt 
their united strength, and were impatient to rush on the mild and 
wealthy climates of the south. His ancestors had been the tributaries 
of the Chinese emperors; and Temugin himself had been disgraced by 
a title of honour and servitude. The court of Pekin was astonished by 
an embassy from its former vassal, who, in the tone of the king cf 
nations, exacted the tribute and obedience which he had paid, and who 
affected to treat the son of heaven as the most contemptible of mankind. 
A haughty answer disguised their secret apprehensions; and their fears 

his^ tenth Dynasty is that of the Moguls of Persia. Assemannus (Biblioth.

lives of the Jacobite maphrians, or primates of the East

Abulfeda, sultan of Hamah in Syria, who fought in person, under the 
Mameluke standard, against the Moguls. 

"Nicephorus Gregoras (I. ii c. 5, 6) has felt the necessity of connecting 
the Scythian and Byzantine histories. He describes with truth and elegance 
the settlement and manners of the Moguls of Persia, but he is ignorant 
of their origin, and corrupts the names of Zingis and his sons.

628 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

were soon justified by the march of innumerable squadrons, who pierced 
on all sides the feeble rampart of the great wall. Ninety cities were 
stormed, or starved, by the Moguls; ten only escaped; and Zingis, from 
a knowledge of the filial piety of the Chinese, covered his vanguard 
with their captive parents; an unworthy, and by degrees a fruitless, 
abuse of the virtue of his enemies. His invasion was supported by the 
revolt of a hundred thousand Khitans, who guarded the frontier: yet 
he listened to a treaty; and a princess of China, three thousand horses, 
five hundred youths and as many virgins, and a tribute of gold and 
silk, were the price of his retreat. In his second expedition he compelled 
the Chinese emperor to retire beyond the Yellow River to a more south- 
ern residence. The siege of Pekin 19 was long and laborious: the inhab- 
itants were reduced by famine to decimate and devour their fellow- 
citizens; when their ammunition was spent, they discharged ingots of 
.gold and silver from their engines; but the Moguls introduced a mine 
to the centre of the capital; and the conflagration of the palace burnt 
.above thirty days. China was desolated by Tartar war and domestic 
faction; and the five northern provinces were added to the empire of 
Hingis. 

In the West he touched the dominions of Mohammed sultan of Ca- 
.rizme, who reigned from the Persian Gulf to the borders of India and 
Turkestan; and who, in the proud imitation of Alexander the Great, 
forgot the servitude and ingratitude of his fathers to the house of Sel- 
juk. It was the wish of Zingis to establish a friendly and commercial 
intercourse with the most powerful of the Moslem princes; nor could 
he be tempted by the secret solicitations of the caliph of Bagdad, who 
sacrificed to his personal wrongs the safety of the church and state. A 
rash and inhuman deed provoked and justified the Tartar arms in the 
invasion of the southern Asia. A caravan of three ambassadors and one 
hundred and fifty merchants was arrested and murdered at Otrar, by the 
command of Mohammed; nor was it till after a demand and denial of 
justice, till he had prayed and fasted three nights on a mountain, that 
the Mogul emperor appealed to the judgment of God and his sword. 
Our European battles, says a philosophic writer, 20 are petty skirmishes, 
if compared to the numbers that have fought and fallen in the fields of 
Asia. Seven hundred thousand Moguls and Tartars are said to have 
marched under the standard of Zingis and his four sons. In the vast 
plains that extend to the north of the Sihon or Jaxartes they were en- 
countered by four hundred thousand soldiers of the sultan; and in the 
first battle, which was suspended by the night, one hundred and sixty 

"More properly Yen-king, an ancient city, whose ruins still appear some 
furlongs to the south-east of the modern Pekin, which was built by Cublai 
Khan (Gaubil, p. 146). Pe-king and Nan-king are vague titles, the courts 
of the north and of the south. The identity and change of names perplex 
the most skilful readers of the Chinese geography (p. 177).

account of Zingis and the Moguls contains, as usual, much general sense 
and truth, with some particular errors.

thousand Carizmians were slain. Mohammed was astonished by tie 
multitude and valour of his enemies; he withdrew from the scene of 
danger, and distributed his troops in the frontier towns; trusting that 
the barbarians, invincible in the field, would be repulsed by the length 
and difficulty of so many regular sieges. But the prudence of Zingis 
had formed a body of Chinese engineers, skilled in the mechanic^ arts; 
informed perhaps of the secret of gunpowder, and capable, under his dis* 
cipline, of attacking a foreign country with more vigour and success 
than they had defended their own. The Persian historians will relate 
the sieges and reduction of Otrar, Cogende, Bochara, Samarcand, Ca- 
rizme, Herat, Merou, Nisabour, Balch, and Candahar; and the conquest 
of the rich and populous countries of Transoxiana, Carizme, and Chora- 
zan. The destructive hostilities of Attila an- the Huns have long since 
been elucidated by the example of Zingis ana the Moguls; and in this 
more proper place I shall be content to observe, that, from the Caspian 
to the Indus, they ruined a tract of many hundred miles, which was 
adorned with the habitations and labours of mankind, and that five 
centuries have not been sufficient to repair the ravages of four years* 
The Mogul empero T . jacouraged or indulged the fury of his troops: the 
hope of future possession was lost in the ardour of rapine and slaughter; 
and the cause of the war exasperated their native fierceness by the pre- 
tence of justice and revenge. The downfall and death of the sultan Mo- 
hammed, who expired, unpkied and alone, in a desert island of the 
Caspian Sea, is a poor atonement for the calamities of which he was 
the author. Could the Carizmian empire have been saved by a single 
hero, it would have been saved by his son Gelaleddin, whose active 
valour repeatedly checked the Moguls in the career of victory. Re- 
treating, as he fought, to the sanks of the Indus, he was oppressed by 
their innumerable host, till, in the last moment of despair, Gelaleddin 
spurred his horse into the waves, swam one of the broadest and most 
rapid rivers of Asia, and extorted the admiration and applause of Zingis 
himself. It was in this camp that the Mogul conqueror yielded ^ with 
reluctance to the murmurs of his weary and wealthy troops, who sighed 
for the enjoyment of their native land. Incumbered with the spoils of 
Asia, he slowly measured back his footsteps, betrayed some pity for the 
misery of the vanquished, and declared his intention o.f rebuilding the 
cities which had been swept away by the tempest of ais arms. After he 
had repassed the Oxus and Jaxartes he was joined by two generals whom 
he had detached with thirty thousand horse to subdue the western prov- 
inces of Persia. They had trampled on the nations which opposed their 
passage, penetrated through the gates of Derbend, traversed the Volga 
and the desert, and accomplished the circuit of the Caspian Sea, by an 
expedition which had never been attempted, and has never been re- 
peated. The return of Zingis was signalised by the overthrow of the 
rebellious or independent kingdoms of Tartary; and he died in the 
fulness of years and glory, with his last breath exhorting and instruct- 
ing his sons to achieve the conquest of the Chinese empire. 



$30 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

The harem of Zingis was composed of five hundred wives and con- 
cubines; and of his numerous progeny, four sons, illustrious by their 
birth and merit, exercised under their father the principal offices of 
peace and war. Toushi was his great huntsman, Zagatai 21 his judge, 
Octai his minister, and Tuli his general; and their names and actions are 
ften conspicuous in the history of his conquests. Firmly united for 
their own and the public interest, the three brothers and their families 
were content with dependent sceptres; and Octai, by general consent, 
was proclaimed great khan, or emperor of the Moguls and Tartars. He 
was succeeded by his son Gayuk, after whose death the empire devolved 
to his cousins Mangou and Cublai, the sons of Tuli, and the grandsons 
of Zingis. In the sixty-eight years of his four first successors, the Mogul 
subdued almost all Asia and a large portion of Europe. Without confin- 
ing myself to the order of time, without expatiating on the detail of 
events, I shall present a general picture of the progress of their arms; 
I. In the East; II. In the South; III. In the West; and IV. In the 
North. 

I. Before the invasion of Zingis, China was divided into two empires 
or dynasties of the North and South; 22 and the difference of origin and 
interest was smoothed by a general conformity of laws, language, and 
national manners. The Northern empire, which had been dismembered 
by Zingis, was finally subdued seven years after his death. After the 
loss of Pekin, the emperor had fixed his residence at Kaifong, a city 
many leagues in circumference, and which contained, according to the 
Chinese annals, fourteen hundred thousand families of inhabitants and 
fugitives. He escaped from thence with only seven horsemen, and 
made his last stand in a third capital, till at length the hopeless monarch, 
protesting his innocence and accusing his fortune, ascended a funeral 
pile, and gave orders that, as soon as he had stabbed himself, the fire 
should be kindled by his attendants. The dynasty of the Song, the 
native and ancient sovereigns of the whole empire, survived about forty- 
five years the fall of the Northern usurpers; and the perfect conquest 
was reserved for the arms of Cublai. During this interval the Moguls 
were often diverted by foreign wars; and, if the Chinese seldom dared 
to meet their victors in the field, their passive courage presented an 
endless succession of cities to storm and of millions to slaughter. In 
the attack and defence of places the engines of antiquity and the Greek 
fire were alternately employed: the use of gunpowder in cannon and 

! 

a Zagatai gave his name to his dominions of Maurenahar, or Transoxiana; 
and the Moguls of Hindostan, who emigrated from that country, are styled 
Zagatais by the ^ Persians. This certain etymology, and the similar example 
of Uzbek, Nogai, etc., may warn us not absolutely to reject. the derivations 
of a national, from a personal, name. 

*In Marco Polo, and the Oriental geographers, the names of Cathay and 
Mangi distinguish the northern and southern empires, which, from A.D. 1234 
to 1279, were those of the great khan and of the Chinese. The search 
of Cathay, after China had been found, excited and misled our navigators 
of the sixteenth century in their attempts to discover the north-east passage. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 631 

bombs appears as a familiar practice; 23 and the sieges were conducted by 
the Mohammedans and Franks, who had been liberally invited into the 
service of Cublai. After passing the great river the troops and artillery 
were conveyed along a series of canals, till they invested the royal resi- 
dence of Hamcheu, or Quinsay, in the country of silk, the most delicious 
climate of China. The emperor, a defenceless youth, surrendered his 
person and sceptre; and before he was sent in exile into Tartary he 
struck nine times the ground with his forehead, to adore in prayer or 
thanksgiving the mercy of the great khan. Yet the war (it was now 
styled a rebellion) was still maintained in the southern provinces from 
Hamcheu to Canton; and the obstinate remnant of independence and 
hostility was transported from the land to the sea. But when the fleet 
of the Song was surrounded and oppressed by a superior armament, 
their last champion leaped into the waves with his infant emperor in 
his arms. " It is more glorious," he cried, " to die a prince than to live 
a slave." A hundred thousand Chinese imitated his example; and the 
whole empire, from Tonkin to the great wall, submitted to the dominion 
of Cublai. His boundless ambition aspired to the conquest of Japan: 
his fleet was twice shipwrecked; and the lives of a hundred thousand 
Moguls and Chinese were sacrificed in the fruitless expedition. But 
the circumjacent kingdoms, Corea, Tonkin, Cochin-china, Pegu, Ben- 
gal, and Thibet, were reduced in different degrees of tribute and obedi- 
ence by the effort or terror of his arms. He explored the Indian Ocean 
with a fleet of a thousand ships: they sailed in sixty-eight days most 
probably to the isle of Borneo, under the equinoctial line; and though 
they returned not without spoil or glory, the emperor was dissatisfied 
that the savage king had escaped from their hands. 

n. The conquest of Hindostan by the Moguls was reserved in a later 
period for the house of Timour ; but that of Iran, or Persia, was achieved 
by Holagou Khan, the grandson of Zingis, the brother and lieutenant of 
the two successive emperors, Mangou and Cublai. I shall not enumer- 
ate the crowd of sultans, emirs, and atabeks whom he trampled into 
dust; but the extirpation of the Assassins, or Ismaelians 2 * of Persia, 
may be considered as a service to mankind. Among the hills to the south 

88 1 depend on the knowledge and fidelity o the Pere Gaubil, who trans- 
lates the Chinese text of the annals of the Moguls or Yuen (p. 71, 93, 153) ; 
but I am ignorant at what time these annals were composed and published. 
The two uncles of Marco Polo, who served as engineers at the siege of 
Siengyangfou (1. ii. c. 61, in Ramusio, torn, ii.; see Gaubil, p. 155, 157), 
must have felt and related the effects of this destructive powder; and 
their silence is a weighty, and almost decisive, objection. I entertain a 
suspicion that the recent discovery was carried from Europe to China by 
the caravans of the fifteenth century, and falsely adopted as an old national 
discovery before the arrival of the Portuguese and Jesuits in the sixteenth. 
Yet the P&amp;re Gaubil affirms that the use of gunpowder has been known to 
the Chinese above 1600 years. 

24 All that can be known of the Assassins of Persia and Syria is poured 
from the copious, and even profuse, erudition of M. Falconet, in two 
MSmoires read before the Academy of Inscriptions (torn. xvii. p, 127-170).

of the Caspian these odious sectaries had reigned with impunity above 
a hundred and sixty years; and their prince, or imam, established his 
lieutenant to lead and govern the colony of Mount Libanus, so famous 
and formidable in the history of the crusades. 25 With the fanaticism of 
the Koran the Ismaelians had blended the Indian transmigration and the 
visions of their own prophets; and it was their first duty to devote their 
souls and bodies in blind obedience to the vicar of God. The daggers 
of his missionaries were felt both in -the East and West: the Christians 
and the Moslems enumerate, and perhaps multiply, the illustrious vic- 
tims that were sacrificed to the zeal, avarice, or resentment of the old 
man (as he was corruptly styled) of the mountain. But these daggers, 
his only arms, were broken by the sword of Holagou, and not a vestige 
is left of the enemies of mankind, except the word assassin, which, in 
the most odious sense, has been adopted in the languages of Europe. 
The extinction of the Abbassides cannot be indifferent to the spectators 
of their greatness and decline. Since the fall of their Seljukian tyrants 
the caliphs had recovered their lawful dominion of Bagdad and the 
Arabian Irak; but the city was distracted by theological factions, and 
the commander of the faithful was lost in a harem of seven hundred 
concubines. The invasion of the Moguls he encountered with feeble 
arms and haughty embassies. " On the divine decree," said the caliph 
Mostasem, " is founded the throne of the sons of Abbas: and their foes 
shall surely be destroyed in this world and in the next. Who is this 
Holagou that dares to rise against them? If he be desirous of peace, 
let him instantly depart from the sacred territory; and perhaps he may 
obtain from our clemency the pardon of his fault." This presumption 
was cherished by a perfidious vizir, who assured his master that, even 
if the barbarians had entered the city, the women and children from 
the terraces would be sufficient to overwhelm them with stones. But 
when Holagou touched the phantom, it instantly vanished into smoke. 
After a siege of two months Bagdad was stormed and sacked by the 
Moguls; and their savage commander pronounced the death of the 
caliph Mostasem, the last of the temporal successors of Mohammed; 
whose noble kinsmen, of the race of Abbas, had reigned in Asia above 
five hundred years. Whatever might be the designs of the conqueror, 
the holy cities of Mecca and Medina 20 were protected by the Arabian 
desert; but the Moguls spread beyond the Tigris and Euphrates, pil- 
laged Aleppo and Damascus, and threatened to join the Franks in the 

25 The Ismaelians of Syria, 40,000 Assassins, had acquired or founded ten 
castles in the hills above Tortosa. About the year 1280 they were extirpated 
by the Mamalukes. 

28 As a proof of the ignorance of the Chinese in foreign transactions, I 
must observe that some of their historians extend the conquests of Zingis 
himself to Medina, the country of Mohammed (Gaubil, p. 42). 

[Zenghis Khan did not carry on the military operations of his armies. 
He only approved of the suggestions made by his illustrious commanders, 
Sabutai and Samuka, who deserve to rank among the great generals of 
the world. He never interfered with them. O. S.]

deliverance of Jerusalem. Egypt was lost had she been defended only 
by her feeble offspring; but the Mamalukes had breathed in their in- 
fancy the keenness of a Scythian air: equal in valour, superior in disci- 
pline, they met the Moguls in many a well-fought field; and drove 
back the stream of hostility to the eastward of the Euphrates. But it 
overflowed with resistless violence the kingdoms of Armenia and Ana- 
tolia, of which the former was possessed by the Christians and the latter 
by the Turks. The sultans of Iconium opposed some resistance to the 
Mogul arms till Azzadin sought a refuge among the Greeks of Con- 
stantinople, and his feeble successors, the last of the Seljukian dynasty, 
were finally extirpated by the khans of Persia. 

III. No sooner had Octai subverted the northern empire of China 
than he resolved to visit with his arms the most remote countries of 
the West. Fifteen hundred thousand Moguls and Tartars were in- 
scribed on the military roll: of these the great khan selected a third, 
which he intrusted to the command of his nephew Batou, the son of 
Tuli; who reigned over his father's conquests to the north of the Cas- 
pian Sea. After a festival of forty days Batou set forwards on this 
great expedition; and such was the speed and ardour of his innumerable 
squadrons, that in less than six years they had measured a line of 
ninety degrees of longitude, a fourth part of the circumference of the 
globe. The great rivers of Asia and Europe, the Volga and Kama, the 
Don and Borysthenes, the Vistula and Danube, they either swam with 
their horses or passed on the ice, or traversed in leathern boats, which 
followed the camp and transported their waggons and artillery. By the 
first victories of Batou the remains of national freedom were eradicated 
in the immense plains df Turkestan and Kipzak. 27 In his rapid prog- 
ress he overran the kingdoms, as they are now styled, of Astracan and 
Cazan; and the troops which he detached towards Mount Caucasus 
explored the most secret recesses of Georgia and Circassia. The civil 
discord of the great dukes, or princes, of Russia betrayed their country 
to the Tartars. They spread from Livonia to the Black Sea, and both 
Moscow and Kiow, the modern and the ancient capitals, were reduced to 
ashes; a temporary ruin, less fatal than the deep, and perhaps indelible, 
mark which a servitude of two hundred years has imprinted on the 
character of the Russians. The Tartars ravaged with equal fury the 
countries which they hoped to possess and those which they were hasten- 
ing to leave. From the permanent conquest of Russia they made a 
deadly, though transient, inroad into the heart of Poland, and as far 
as the borders of Germany. The cities of Lublin and Cracow were 
obliterated: they approached the shores of the Baltic; and in the battle 
of Lignite they defeated the dukes of Silesia, the Polish palatines, and 
the great master of the Teutonic order, and filled nine sacks with the 
right ears of the slain. From Lignite, the extreme point of their western 

w The DashtS Kipzak, or plain of Kipzak, extends on either side of the 
Volga, in a boundless space towards the Jaik and Borysthenes, and is 
supposed to contain the primitive name and nation of the Cosacks.

march, they turned aside to the invasion of Hungary; and the presence 
or spirit of Batou inspired the host of five hundred thousand men: the 
Carpathian hills could not be long impervious to their divided columns; 
and their approach had been fondly disbelieved till it was irresistibly 
felt. The king, Bela the Fourth, assembled the military force of his 
counts and bishops; but he had alienated the nation by adopting a 
vagrant horde of forty thousand families of Comans, and these savage 
guests were provoked to revolt by the suspicion of treachery and the 
murder of their prince. The whole country north of the Danube was 
lost in a day and depopulated in a summer; and the ruins of cities and 
churches were overspread with the bones of the natives who expiated the 
sins of their Turkish ancestors. An ecclesiastic who fled frcm the sack 
of Waradin describes the calamities which he had seen or suffered; and 
the sanguinary rage of sieges and battles is far less atrocious than the 
treatment of the fugitives, who had been allured from the woods under 
a promise of peace and pardon, and who were coolly slaughtered as 
soon as they had performed the labours of the harvest and vintage. 
In the winter the Tartars passed the Danube on the ice and advanced 
to Gran or Strigonium, a German colony, and the metropolis of the 
kingdom. Thirty engines were planted against the walls; the ditches 
were filled with sacks of earth and dead bodies; and after a promiscuous 
massacre, three hundred noble matrons were slain in the presence of 
the khan. Of all the cities and fortresses of Hungary three alone sur- 
vived the Tartar invasion, and the unfortunate Bela hid his head among 
the islands of the Adriatic. 

. The Latin world was darkened by this cloud of savage hostility: a 
Russian fugitive carried the alarm to Sweden; and the remote nations 
of the Baltic and the ocean trembled at the approach of the Tartars, 28 
whom their fear and ignorance were inclined to separate from the human 
species. Since the invasion of the Arabs in the eighth century Europe 
had never been exposed to a similar calamity; and if the disciples of 
Mohammed would have oppressed her religion and liberty, it might be 
apprehended that the shepherds of Scythia would extinguish ier cities, 
her arts, and all the institutions of civil society. The Roman pontiff 
attempted to appease and convert these invincible pagans by a mission 
of Franciscan and Dominican friars; but he was astonished by the reply 
of the khan, that the sons of God and of Zingis were invested with a 
divine power to subdue or extirpate the nations ; and that the pope would 
be involved in the universal destruction, unless he visited in person and 
as a suppliant the royal horde. The emperor Frederic the Second em- 
braced a more generous mode of defence; and his letters to the kings of 

"In the year 1238 the inhabitants of Gothia (Sweden') and Frise were 
prevented, by their fear of the Tartars, from sending, as usual, their ships 
to tire herring-fishery on the coast of England ; and, as . there was no ex- 
portation, forty or fifty of these fish were sold for a shilling (Matthew 
Paris, p. 396).. It is whimsical enough that the orders of a Mogul khan, 
who reigned on the borders of China, should have lowered the price of 
herrings in the English market 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE $35 

France and England and the princes of Germany represented the com- 
mon danger, and urged them to arm their vassals in tfrfc just and ra- 
tional crusade. 29 The Tartars themselves were awed by the fame and 
valour of the Franks: the town of Neustadt in Austria was bravely 
defended against them by fifty knights and twenty cross-bows; and they 
raised the siege on the appearance of a German army. After wasting 
the adjacent kingdoms of Servia, Bosnia, and Bulgaria, Batou slowly 
retreated from the Danube to the Volga to enjoy the rewards of vic- 
tory in the city and palace of Serai, which started at his command from 
the midst of the desert. 

IV. Even, the poor and frozen regions of the north attracted the arms 
of the Moguls: Sheibani khan, the brother of the great Batou, led a 
horde of fifteen thousand families into the wilds of Siberia; and his 
descendants reigned at Tobolskoi above three centuries till the Russian 
conquest. The spirit of enterprise which pursued the course of the 
Oby and Yenisei must have led to the discovery of the Icy Sea. After 
brushing away the monstrous fables of men with dogs' heads and cloven 
feet, we shall find that, fifteen years after the death of Zingis, the Mo- 
guls were informed of the name and manners of the Samoyedes in the 
neighbourhood of the polar circle, who dwelt in subterraneous huts and 
derived their furs and their food from the sole occupation of hunting. 80 

While. China, Syria, and Poland were invaded at the same time by 
the Moguls and Tartars, the authors of the mighty mischief were con- 
tent with the knowledge and declaration that their word was the sword 
of death. Like the first caliphs, the first successors of Zingis seldom 
appeared in person at the head of their victorious armies. On the 
banks of the Onon and Selinga the royal or golden horde exhibited the 
contrast of simplicity and greatness; of the roasted sheep and mare's 
milk which composed their banquets; and of a distribution in one day 
of five hundred waggons of gold and silver. The ambassadors and 
princes of Europe and Asia were compelled to undertake this distant and 
laborious pilgrimage; and the life and reign of the great dukes of Rus- 
sia, the kings of Georgia and Armenia, the sultans of Iconiuin, and the 
emirs of Persia, were decided by the frown or smile of the great khan. 
The sons and grandsons of Zingis had been accustomed to the pastoral 
life; but the village of Caracorum 81 was gradually ennobled by their

election and residence. A change of manners is implied in the removal 
of Octal and Mangou from a tent to a house; and their example was 
imitated by the princes of their family and the great officers of the 
empire. Instead of the boundless forest, the enclosure of a park af- 
forded the more indolent pleasures of the chase; their new habitations 
frere decorated with painting and sculpture; their superfluous treasures 
Rrere cast in fountains, and basins, and statues of massy silver; and the 
artists of China and Paris vied with each other in the service of the 
great khan. 82 Caracorum contained two streets, the one of Chinese 
mechanics, the other of Mohammedan traders; and the places of re- 
ligious worship, one Nestorian church, two mosques, and twelve temples 
of various idols, may represent in some degree the number and division 
of inhabitants. Yet a French missionary declares that the town of St. 
Denys, near Paris, was more considerable than the Tartar capital; and 
that the whole palace of Mangou was scarcely equal to a tenth part of 
that Benedictine abbey. The conquests of Russia and Syria might 
amuse the vanity of the great khans; but they were seated on the 
borders of China; the acquisition of that empire was the nearest and 
most interesting object; and they might learn from their pastoral 
economy that it is for the advantage of the shepherd to protect and 
propagate his flock. I have already celebrated the wisdom and virtue 
of a mandarin who prevented the desolation of five populous and cul- 
tivated provinces. In a spotless administration of thirty years this 
friend of his country and of mankind continually laboured to mitigate, 
or suspend, the havoc of war; to save the monuments, and to rekindle 
the flame, of science; to restrain the military commander by the restora- 
tion of civil magistrates; and to instil the love of peace and justice into 
the minds of the Moguls. He struggled with the barbarism of the first 
conquerors; but his salutary lessons produced a rich harvest in the sec- 
ond generation. The northern, and by degrees the southern, empire 
acquiesced in the government of Cublai, the lieutenant, and afterwards 
the successor, of Mangou; and the nation was loyal to a prince who 
had been educated in the manners of China. He restored the forms of 
her venerable constitution; and the victors submitted to the laws, the 
fashions, and even the prejudices, of the vanquished people. This 
peaceful triumph, which has been more than once repeated, may be 
ascribed, in a great measure, to the numbers and servitude of the 
Chinese. The Mogul army was dissolved in a vast and populous coun- 
try; and their emperors adopted with pleasure a political system which 
gives to the prince the solid substance of despotism, and leaves to the

miles (Bell's Travels, vol. ii. p. 67).

subject the empty names of philosophy, freedom, and filial obedience. 
Under the reign of Cublai, letters and commerce, peace and justice, 
were restored; the great canal of five hundred miles was opened from 
Nankin to the capital; he fixed his residence at Pekin; and displayed in 
his court the magnificence of the greatest monarch of Asia. Yet this 
learned prince declined from the pure and simple religion of his great 
ancestor: he sacrificed to the idol Fo; and his blind attachment to the 
lamas of Thibet and the bonzes of China 83 provoked the censure of the 
disciples of Confucius. His successors polluted the palace with a crowd 
of eunuchs, physicians, and astrologers, while thirteen millions of their 
subjects were consumed in the provinces by famine. One hundred and 
forty years after the death of Zingis, his degenerate race, the dynasty of 
the Yuen, was expelled by a revolt of the native Chinese; and the Mogul 
emperors were lost in the oblivion of the desert. Before this revolution 
they had forfeited their supremacy over the dependent branches of their 
house, the khans of Kipzak and Russia, the khans of Zagatai or Trans- 
oxiana, and the khans of Iran or Persia. By their distance and power 
these royal lieutenants had soon been released from the duties of obedi- 
ence; and after the death of Cublai they scorned to accept a sceptre or 
a title from his unworthy successors. According to their respective sit- 
uation, they maintained the simplicity of the pastoral life, or assumed 
the luxury of the cities of Asia; but the princes and their hordes were 
alike disposed for the reception of a foreign worship. After some hesi- 
tation between the Gospel and the Koran, they conformed to the re- 
ligion of Mohammed; and while they adopted for their brethren the 
Arabs and Persians, they renounced all intercourse with the ancient 
Moguls, the idolaters of China. 

In this shipwreck of nations some surprise may be excited by the es- 
cape of the Roman empire, whose relics, at the time of the Mogul inva- 
sion, were dismembered by the Greeks and Latins. Less potent tMn 
Alexander, they were pressed, like the Macedonian, both in Europe and 
Asia, by the shepherds of Scythia; and had the Tartars undertaken the 
siege, Constantinople must have yielded to the fate of Pekin, Samar- 
cand, and Bagdad. The glorious and voluntary retreat of Batou from 
the Danube was insulted by the vain triumph of the Franks and 
Greeks; 8 * and in a second expedition death surprised him in full march 
to attack the capital of the Caesars. His brother Borga carried the Tar- 
tar arms into Bulgaria and Thrace; but he was diverted from the By- 



attachment of the khans, and the hatred of the mandarins, to the 
bonzes and lamas (Duhalde, Hist, de la Chine, torn. i. p. 502, 503) seems 
to represent them as the priests of the same god, of the Indian Fo, whose 
worship prevails among the sects of Hindostan, Siam, Thibet, China, and 
Japan. But this mysterious subject is still lost in a cloud, which tie re- 
searches of our Asiatic Society may gradually dispel. 

*Some repulse of the Moguls in Hungary (Matthew Paris, p. 545, 546) 
might propagate and colour the report of the union and victory of the 
kings of the Franks on the confines of Bulgaria. Abulpkaragius (Dynast 
p. 310), after forty years beyond the Tigris, might be easily deceived.

zantine war by a visit to Novogorod, in the fifty-seventh degree of lati- 
tude, where he numbered the inhabitants, and regulated the tributes, 
of Russia. The Mogul khan formed an alliance with the Mamalukes 
against his brethren of Persia: three hundred thousand horse pene- 
trated through the gates of Derbend, and the Greeks might rejoice in 
the first example of domestic war. After the recovery of Constantinople, 
Michael Palseologus, 35 at a distance from his court and army, was sur- 
prised and surrounded in a Thracian castle by twenty thousand Tar- 
tars. But the object of their march was a private interest: they came 
to the deliverance of Azzadin the Turkish sultan, and were content with 
his person and the treasure of the emperor. Their general Noga, whose 
name is perpetuated in the hordes of Astracan, raised a formidable 
rebellion against Mengo Timour, the third of the khans of Kipzak, 
obtained in marriage Maria the natural daughter of Palaeologus, and 
guarded the dominions of his friend and father. The subsequent inva- 
sions of a Scythian cast were those of outlaws and fugitives; and some 
thousands of Alani and Comans, who had been driven from their 
native seats, were reclaimed from a vagrant life and enlisted in the 
service of the empire. Such was the influence in Europe of the inva- 
sion of the Moguls. The first terror of 'their arms secured rather than 
disturbed the peace of the Roman Asia. The sultan of Iconium solicited 
a personal interview with John Vataces; and his artful policy encour- 
aged the Turks to defend their barrier against the common enemy. 80 
That barrier indeed was soon overthrown, and the servitude and ruin 
of the Sdjukians exposed the nakedness of the Greeks. The formidable 
Holagou threatened to march to Constantinople at the head of four 
hundred thousand men; and the groundless panic of the citizens of Nice 
will present an image of the terror which he had inspired. The acci- 
dent of a procession, and the sound of a doleful litany, " From the 
fury of the Tartars, good Lord, deliver us," had scattered the hasty 
report of an assault and massacre. In the blind credulity of fear the 
streets of Nice were crowded with thousands of both sexes, who knew 
not from what or to whom they fled; and some hours elapsed before 
the firmness of the military officers could relieve the city from this 
imaginary foe. But the ambition of Holagou and his successors was 
fortunately diverted by the conquest of Bagdad and a long vicissitude 
of Syrian wars; their hostility to the Moslems inclined them to unite 
with the Greeks and Franks; 87 and their generosity or contempt had 
offered the kingdom of Anatolia as the reward of an Armenian vassal. 
The fragments of the Seljukian monarchy were disputed by the emirs

Greeks; and of this he is a competent witness. Hayton likewise, the 
Armeniac prince, celebrates their friendship for himself and his nation. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 639 

who had occupied the cities or the mountains; but they all confessed the 
supremacy of the khans of Persia; and he often interposed his authority, 
and sometimes his arms, to check their depredations, and to preserve 
the peace and balance of his Turkish frontier. The death of Cazan/ jfl 
one of the greatest and most accomplished princes of the house of 
Zingis, removed this salutary control; and the decline of the Moguls 
gave a free scope to the rise and progress of the OTTOMAN EMPIRE. 30 

After the retreat of Zingis the sultan Gelaleddin of Carizme had 
returned from India to the possession and defence of his Persian king- 
doms. In the peace of eleven years that hero fought in person fourteen 
battles; and such was his activity that he led his cavalry in seventeen 
days from Teflis to Kerman, a march of a thousand miles. Yet he was 
oppressed by the jealousy of the Moslem princes and the innumerable 
armies of the Moguls; and after his last defeat Gelaleddin perished 
ignobly in the mountains of Curdistan. His death dissolved a veteran 
and adventurous army, which included under the name of Carizmians 
or Corasmins many Turkman hordes that had attached themselves to 
the ^ sultan's fortune. The bolder and more powerful chiefs invaded 
Syria, and violated the holy sepulchre of Jerusalem: the more humble 
engaged in the service of Aladin sultan of Iconium, and among these 
were the obscure fathers of the Ottoman line. They had formerly 
pitched their tents near the southern banks of the Oxus, in the plains of 
Mahan and Nesa; .and it is somewhat remarkable that the same spot 
should have produced the first authors of the Parthian and Turkish 
empires. At the head, or in the rear, of a Carizmian army, Soliman 
Shah was drowned in the passage of the Euphrates: his son Orthogrul 
became the soldier and subject of Aladin, and established at Surgut, 
on the banks of the Sangar, a camp of four hundred families or tents, 
whom he governed fifty-two years both in peace and war. He was the 
father of Thaman, or Athman, whose Turkish name has been melted into 
the appellation of the caliph Othman: 40 and if we describe that pastoral 
chief as a shepherd and a robber, we must separate from those char- 
acters all idea of ignominy and baseness. Othman possessed, and per- 
haps surpassed, the ordinary virtues of a soldier; and the circumstances 
of time and place were propitious to his independence and success. The 
Seljukian dynasty was no more, and the distance and decline of the 
Mogul khans soon enfranchised him from the control of a superior. 

^Pachymer gives a splendid character of Cazan Khan, the rival of Cyrus 
and Alexander (L xii. c. i). In the conclusion of his history (L xiii. c. 36 
[torn. ii. p. 651, ed. Bonn]), he hopes much from the arrival of 30,000 
Tochars, or Tartars, who were ordered by the successor of Cazan to restrain 
the Turks of Bithynia, A.D. 1308. 

39 The origin of the Ottoman dynasty is illustrated by the critical learn- 
ing of MM. de Guignes (Hist des Huns, torn. iv. p. 329-337) and D'Anville 
(Empire Turc, p. 14-22), two inhabitants of Paris, from whom the Orientals 
may learn the history and geography of their own country.

640 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

He was situate on the verge of the Greek empire: the Koran sanctified 
his gazi, or holy war, against the infidels; and their political errors 
unlocked the passes of Mount Olympus, and invited him to descend 
into the plains of Bithynia. Till the reign of Palaeologus these passes 
had been vigilantly guarded by the militia of the country, who were 
repaid by their own safety and an exemption from taxes. The emperor 
abolished their privilege and assumed their office; but the tribute was 
rigorously collected, the custody of the passes was neglected, and the 
hardy mountaineers degenerated into a trembling crowd of peasants 
without spirit or discipline. It was on the twenty-seventh of July, in 
the year twelve hundred and ninety-nine of the Christian era, that Oth- 
man first invaded the territory of Nicodemia; 41 and the singular accur- 
acy of the date seems to disclose some foresight of the rapid and de- 
structive growth of the monster. The annals of the twenty-seven years 
of his reign would exhibit a repetition of the same inroads; and his 
hereditary troops were multiplied in each campaign by the accession of 
captives and volunteers. Instead of retreating to the hills, he main- 
tained the most useful and defensible posts, fortified the towns and 
castles which he had first pillaged, and renounced the pastoral life for 
the baths and palaces of his infant capitals. But it was not till Othman 
was oppressed by age and infirmities that he received the welcome news 
of the conquest of Prusa, which had been surrendered by famine or 
treachery to the arms of his son Orchan. The glory of Othman is 
chiefly founded on that of his descendants; but the Turks have tran- 
scribed or composed a royal testament of his last counsels of justice 
and moderation. 42 

From the conquest of Prusa we may date the true era of the Otto- 
man empire. The lives and possessions of the Christian subjects were 
redeemed by a tribute or ransom of thirty thousand crowns of gold;

guard of the mountains, 1. i. c. 3-6; Nicephorus Gregoras, 1. viL c. i; and

49 1 am ignorant whether the Turks have any writers older than Mohammed 
II, nor can I reach beyond a meagre chronicle (Annales Turcici ad Annum 
JSS )* translated by John Gaudier, and published by Leunclavius (ad calcem 
Laonic. Chalcocond. p. 3H-350), with copious pandects, or commentaries. 
The History of the Growth and Decay (AJ&gt;. 1300-1683) of the Othman 
Empire ^ was translated into English from the Latin MS. of Demetrius 
Cantemir, prince of Moldavia (London, 1734, in folio). The author is 
guilty of strange blunders in Oriental history; but he was conversant with 
the language, the annals, and institutions of the Turks. Cantemir partly 
draws his materials from the Synopsis of Saadi Effendi of Larissa, dedicated 
in the year 1696 to sultan Mustapha, and a valuable abridgment of the 
original historians. In one of the Ramblers Dr.. Johnson praises Knolles 
(A General History of the Turks to the present Year: London, 1603) as 
the first of historians, unhappy only in the choice of his subject. Yet 
I much doubt whether a partial and verbose compilation from Latin writers, 
thirteen hundred folio pages of speeches and battles, can either instruct 
or amuse an enlightened age, which requires from the historian some tincture 
of philosophy and criticism.

and the city, by the labours of Orchan, assumed the aspect of a Mo- 
hammedan capital; Pnisa was decorated with a mosque, a college, and 
an hospital, of royal foundation; the Seljukian coin was changed for 
the name and impression of the new dynasty; and the most skilful pro- 
fessors of human and divine knowledge attracted the Persian and 
Arabian students from the ancient schools of Oriental learning. The 
office of vizir was instituted for Aladin, the brother of Orchan; and a 
different habit distinguished the citizens from the peasants, the Mos- 
lems from the infidels. All the troops of Othman had consisted of loose 
squadrons of Turkman cavalry, who served without pay and fought 
without discipline; but a regular body of infantry was first established 
and trained by the prudence of his son. A great number of volunteers 
was enrolled with a small stipend, but with the permission of living at 
home, unless they were summoned to the field: their rude manners and 
seditious temper disposed Orchan to educate his young captives as his 
soldiers and those of the prophet; but the Turkish peasants were still 
allowed to mount on horseback and follow his standard, with the appel- 
lation and the hopes of freebooters. By these arts he formed an army of 
twenty-five thousand Moslems: a train of battering engines was framed 
for the use of sieges; and the first successful experiment was made on 
the cities of Nice and Nicomedia. Orchan granted a safe-conduct to all 
who were desirous of departing with their families and effects; but the 
widows of the slain were given in marriage to the conquerors; and the 
sacrilegious plunder, the books, the vases, and the images, were sold or 
ransomed at Constantinople. The emperor Andronicus the Younger 
was vanquished and wounded by the son of Othman: 43 he subdued the 
whole province or kingdom of Bithynia as far as the shores of the Bos- 
phorus and Hellespont; and the Christians confessed the justice and 
clemency of a reign which claimed the voluntary attachment of the 
Turks of Asia. Yet Orchan was content with the modest title of emir; 
and in the list of his compeers, the princes of Roum or Anatolia,** his 
military forces were surpassed by the emirs of Ghermian and Cara- 
mania, each of whom could bring into the field an army of forty thou- 
sand men. Their dominions were situate in the heart of the Seljukian 
kingdom: but the holy warriors, though of inferior note, who formed 
new principalities on the Greek empire, are more conspicuous in the 
light of history. The maritime country from the Propontis to the 
Maeander and the isle of Rhodes, so long threatened and so often pfl- 

41 Cantacuzene, though he relates the battle and heroic flight of the younger 
Andronicus (L ii. c. 6, 7, 8), dissembles by his silence the loss of Prusa, 
Nice, and Nicomedia, which are fairly confessed by Nicephorus Gregoras 
(1. viii. 15; ix. 9, 13; xi. 6). It appears that Nice was taken by Orchan 
in 1330, and Nicomedia in 1339, which are somewhat different from the 
Turkish dates. 

**The partition of the Turkish emirs is extracted from two contemporaries, 
the Greek Nicephorus Gregoras (1. vii. i) and the Arabian Marakeschi 
(De Guignes, torn. ii. P. ii. p. 76, 77). See likewise the first book of Laonicus 
Chalcocondyles.

laged, was finally lost about the thirtieth year of Andronicus the Eider. 45 
Two Turkish chieftains, Sarukhan and Aidin, left their names to their 
conquests, and their conquests to their posterity. The captivity or ruin 
of the seven churches of Asia was consummated; and the barbarous 
lords of Ionia and Lydia -still trample on the monuments of classic and 
Christian antiquity. In the loss of Ephesus the Christians deplored 
the fall of the first angel, the extinction of the first candlestick, of the 
Revelations; 46 the desolation is complete; and the temple of Diana or 
the church of Mary will equally dude the search of the curious trav- 
eller. The circus and three stately theatres of Laodicea are now peopled 
with wolves and .foxes; Sardes is reduced to a miserable village; the 
God of Mohammed, Tvithout a rival or a son, is invoked in the mosques 
of Thyatira and Pergamus; and the populousness of Smyrna is sup- 
ported by the .foreign trade of the Franks and Armenians. Philadelphia 
alone his been saved by prophecy, or courage. At a distance from the 
sea, forgotten by the emperors, encompassed on all sides by the Turks, 
her valiant citizens defended their religion and freedom above f ourscore 
years, and at length capitulated with the proudest of the Ottomans. 
Among the Greek colonies and churches of Asia, Philadelphia is still 
erect =a column in a scene of ruins a pleasing example that the paths 
of honour and safety may sometimes be the same. The servitude of 
Rhodes was delayed above two centuries by the establishment of the 
knights of St. John of Jerusalem: 47 under the discipline of the order that 
island emerged into fame and opulence; the noble and warlike monks 
were renowned by land and sea; and the bulwark of Christendom pro- 
voked and repelled the arms of the Turks and Saracens. 

The Greeks^ by their intestine -divisions, were the authors of their 
final rum. During the civil wars of the elder and younger Andronicus, 
the son of Othman achieved, almost without resistance, the conquest 
of Bithynia; and the same disorders encouraged the Turkish mirs of 
Lydia and Ionia to build a fleet, and to pillage the adjacent islands and 
the sea-coast of Europe. In the defence of his lif e and honour, Canta- 
cuzene was tempted to prevent, or imitate, his adversaries, by calling 
to his aid the public enemies of his religion and country. Amir, the son 
of Aidin, concealed under a Turkish garb the humanity and politeness 
of a Greek; he was united with the great domestic by mutual esteem and 
reciprocal services; and then: friendship is compared, in the vam rhetoric

The more pious antiquaries labour to reconcile the promises and threats of

of the times, to the perfect union of Orestes and Pylades. 48 On the 
report of the danger of his friend, who was persecuted by an ungrateful 
court, the prince of Ionia assembled at Smyrna a fleet of three hun- 
dred vessels, with an army of twenty-nine thousand men; sailed in the 
depth of winter, and cast anchor at the mouth of the Hebrus. From 
thence, with a chosen band of two thousand Turks, he marched along 
the banks of the river, and rescued the empress, who was besieged in 
Demotica by the wild Bulgarians. At that disastrous moment the life 
or death of his beloved Cantacuzene was concealed by his flight into 
Servia; but the grateful Irene, impatient to behold her deliverer, invited 
him to enter the city, and accompanied her message with a present of 
rich apparel and a hundred horses. By a peculiar strain of delicacy, 
the gentle barbarian refused, in the absence of an unfortunate friend, 
to visit his wife, or to taste the luxuries of the palace; sustained in his 
tent the rigour of the winter; and rejected the hospitable gift, that he 
might share the hardships of two thousand companions, all as deserv- 
ing as himself of that honour and distinction. Necessity and revenge 
might justify his predatory excursions by sea and land; he left nine 
thousand five hundred men for the guard of his fleet; and persevered 
in the fruitless search of Cantacuzene, till his embarkation was hastened 
by a fictitious letter, the severity of the season, the clamours of his inde- 
pendent troops, and the weight of his spoil and captives. In the prose- 
cution of the civil war, the prince of Ionia twice returned to, Europe, 
joined his arms with those of the emperor, besieged Thessalonica, ana 
threatened Constantinople. Calumny might affix some reproach on bis 
imperfect aid, his hasty departure, and a bribe of ten thousand crowns 
which he accepted from the Byzantine court; but his friend was satis- 
fied; and the conduct of Amir is excused by the more sacred duty of de- 
fending against the Latins his hereditary dominions, The maritime 
power of lie Turks had united the pope, the king of Cyprus, the republic 
of Venice, and the order of St. John, in a laudable crusade; their gal- 
leys invaded the coast of Ionia; and Amir was slain with an arrow, to 
the attempt to wrest from the Rhodian knights the citadel of Smyrna. 49 
Before his death he generously recommended another ally of his own 
nation, not more sincere or zealous than himself, but more able to afford 
a prompt and powerful succour, by his situation along the Propontis 
and in front of Constantinople. By the prospect of a more advanta- 
geous treaty, the Turkish prince gf Bithynia was detached from hi$ en- 
gagements with Anne of Savoy; and the pride of Orchan dictated the 

* Nicephorus Gregpras has expatiated with pleasure on this amiable char- 
acter (1. xii. 7; xiii. 4, 10; xiv. i, 9; xvi. 6). Cantacuzene speaks with 
honour and esteem of his ally (1. iii. c. 56, 57, 63, 64, 66, 67, 68, 86, 89, 95, 96), 
but he seems ignorant of his own sentimental passion for the Tur and in- 
directly denies the possibility of such unnatural friendship (L iv. c. 40 
[torn. iii. p. 297, ed. Bonn]).

was imposed by Pope Gregory XL on the knights of Rhodes (see Vertot,

most solemn protestations, that, if he could obtain the daughter of 
Cantacuzene, he would invariably fulfil the duties of a subject and a 
son. Parental tenderness was silenced by the voice of ambition: the 
Greek clergy connived at the marriage of a Christian princess with a 
sectary of Mohammed; and the father of Theodora describes, with 
shameful satisfaction, the dishonour of the purple. 60 A body of Turkish 
cavalry attended the ambassadors, who disembarked from thirty ves- 
sels, before his camp of Selymbria. A stately pavilion was erected, in 
which the empress Irene passed the night with her daughters. In the 
morning Theodora ascended a throne, which was surrounded with cur- 
tains of silk and gold: the troops were under arms; but the emperor 
alone was on horseback. At a signal the curtains were suddenly with- 
drawn, to disclose the bride, or the victim, encircled by kneeling eunuchs 
and hymeneal torches: the sound of flutes and trumpets proclaimed the 
joyful event; and her pretended happiness was the theme of the nuptial 
song, which was chanted by such poets as the age could produce. With- 
out the rites of the church, Theodora was delivered to her barbarous 
lord: but it had been stipulated that she should preserve her religion in 
the harem of Bursa; and her father celebrates her charity and devotion 
in this ambiguous situation. After his peaceful establishment on the 
throne of Constantinople, the Greek emperor visited his Turkish ally, 
who, with four sons, by various wives, expected him at Scutari, on the 
Asiatic shore. The two princes partook; with seeming cordiality, of 
the pleasures of the banquet and the chase; and Theodora was permitted 
to repass the Bosphorus, and to enjoy some days in the society of her 
mother. But the friendship of Orchan was subservient to his religion 
and interest; and in the Genoese war he joined without a blush the 
enemies of Cantacuzene. 

In the treaty with the empress Anne the Ottoman prince had inserted 
a singular condition, that it should be lawful for him to sell his prisoners 
at Constantinople, or transport them into Asia. A naked crowd of 
Christians of both sexes and every age, of priests and monks, of matrons 
and virgins, was exposed in the public market; the whip was frequently 
used to quicken the charity of redemption; and the indigent Greeks 
deplored the fate of their brethren, who were led away to the worst 
evils of temporal and spiritual bondage. 51 Cantacuzene was reduced 
to subscribe the same terms; and their execution must have been still 
more pernicious to the empire: a body of ten thousand Turks had been

Cantacuzene confesses with a guilty blush 1 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 645 

detached to the assistance of the empress Anne; but the entire forces 
of Orchan were exerted in the service of his father. Yet these calami- 
ties were of a transient nature; as soon as the storm had passed away, 
the fugitives might return to their habitations; and at the conclusion 
of the civil and foreign wars Europe was completely evacuated by the 
Moslems of Asia. It was in his last quarrel with his pupil that Canta- 
cuzene inflicted the deep and deadly wound which could never be healed 
by his successors, and which is poorly expiated by his theological dia- 
logues against the prophet Mohajnmed. Ignorant of their own history, 
the modern Turks confound their first and their final passage of the 
Hellespont, 52 and describe the son of Orchan as a nocturnal robber, 
who, with eighty companions, explores by stratagem a hostile and un- 
known shore. Soliman, at the head of ten thousand horse, was trans- 
ported in the vessels, and entertained as the friend, of the Greek 
emperor. In the civil wars of Romania he performed some service and per- 
petrated more mischief; but the Chersonesus was insensibly filled with 
a Turkish colony; and the Byzantine court solicited in vain the resti- 
tution of the fortresses of Thrace. After some artful delays between 
the Ottoman prince and his son, their ransom was valued at sixty thou- 
sand crowns, and the first payment had been made when an earthquake 
shook the walls and cities of the provinces; the dismantled places were 
occupied by the Turks; and Gallipoli, the key of the Hellespont, was 
rebuilt and repeopled by th# policy of Soliman. The abdication of 
Cantacuzene dissolved the feeble bands of domestic alliance; and his 
last advice admonished his countrymen to decline a rash contest, and 
to compare their own weakness with the numbers and valour, the disci- 
pline and enthusiasm, of the Moslems. His prudent counsels were de- 
spised by the headstrong vanity of youth, and soon justified by the vic- 
tories of the Ottomans. But as he practised in the field the exercise of 
the jerid, Soliman was killed by a fall from his horse; and the aged 
Orchan wept and expired on the tomb of his valiant son. 

But the Greeks had not time to rejoice in the death of their enemies; 
and the Turkish scimitar was wielded with the same spirit by Amurath 
the First, the son of Orchan, and the brother of Soliman. By the pale 
and fainting light of the Byzantine annals 58 we can discern that he 
subdued without resistance the whole province of Romania or Thrace, 
from the Hellespont to Mount Haemus and the verge of the capital; 
and that Adrianople was chosen for the royal seat of his government 
and religion in Europe. Constantinople, whose decline is almost coeval 

51 In this passage, and the first conquests in Europe, Cantemir (p. 27, etc.) 
gives a miserable idea of his Turkish guides ; nor am I much better satisfied 
with Chalcocondyles (L i. p. 12, etc. [ed. Par.;- p. 25, ed. Bonn]). They 
forget to consult the most authentic record, the fourth book of Cantacuzene. 
I likewise regret the last books, which are still manuscript, of Nicephorus 
Gregoras.

with her foundation, had often, in the lapse of a thousand years, been 
assaulted by the barbarians of the East and West; but never till this 
fatal hour had the Greeks been surrounded, both in Asia and Europe, by 
the arms of the same hostile monarchy. Yet the prudence or gener- 
osity of Amurath postponed for a while this easy conquest; and his 
pride was satisfied with the frequent and humble attendance of the 
emperor John Palaeologus and his four sons, who followed at his sum- 
mons the court and camp of the Ottoman prince. He marched against 
the Sclavonian nations between the Danube and the Adriatic, the Bul- 
garians, Servians, Bosnians, and Albanians; and these warlike tribes, 
who had so often insulted the majesty of the empire, were repeatedly 
broken by the destructive inroads. Their countries did not abound 
either in gold or silver; nor were their rustic hamlets and townships 
enriched by commerce or decorated by the arts of luxury. But the 
natives of the soil have been distinguished in every age by their hardi- 
ness of mind and body; and they were converted by a prudent insti- 
tution into the firmest and most faithful supporters of the Ottoman 
greatness. 5 * The vizir of Amurath reminded his sovereign that, accord- 
ing to the Mohammedan law, he was entitled to a fifth part of the spoil 
and captives; and that the duty might easily be levied, if vigilant officers 
were stationed at Gallipoli, to watch the passage, and to select for his 
use the stoutest and most beautiful of the Christian youth. The advice 
was followed: the edict was proclaimed; many thousands of the Euro- 
pean captives were educated in religion and arms; and the new militia 
was consecrated and named by a celebrated dervish. Standing in 
the front of their ranks, he stretched the sleeve of his gown over the 
head of the foremost soldier, and his blessing was delivered in these 
words: " Let them be called Janizaries (Yengi cheri, or new soldiers) ; 
may their countenance be ever bright! their hand victorious! their 
sword keen! may their spear always hang over the heads of their en- 
emies; and wheresoever they go, may they return with a white facel " e5&gt; 
Such was the origin of these haughty troops, the terror of the nations, 
and sometimes of the sultans themselves. Their valour has declined, 
their discipline is relaxed, and their tumultuary array is incapable of con- 
tending with the order and weapons of modern tactics; but at the time 
of their institution they possessed a decisive superiority in war; since a 
regular body of infantry, in constant exercise and pay, was not main- 
tained by any of the princes of Christendom. The Janizaries fought 
with the zeal of proselytes against their idolatrous countrymen; and in 
the battle of Cossova the league and independence of the Sclavonian 
tribes was finally crushed. As the conqueror walked over the field, he 
observed that the greatest part of the slain consisted of beardless 
youths; and listened to the flattering reply of his vizir, that age and 

"See^Cantemir, p. 37-41, with his own large and curious annotations.

and reproach in the Turkish language. Hie niger est, hunc tu Romanes

THE ROMAN EMPIRE 647 

wisdom would have taught them not to oppose his irresistible arms. 
But the sword of his Janizaries could not defend him from the dagger 
of despair; a Servian soldier started from the crowd of dead bodies, 
and Amurath was pierced to the belly with a mortal wound. The grand- 
son of Othman was mild in his temper, modest in his apparel, and a 
lover of learning and virtue; but the Moslems were scandalised at his 
absence from public worship; and he was corrected by the firmness of 
the mufti, who dared to reject his testimony in a civil cause; a mixture 
of servitude and freedom not unfrequent in Oriental history. 06 

The character of Bajazet, the son and successor of Amurath, is 
strongly expressed in his surname of Ilderim, or the lightning; and he 
might glory in an epithet which was drawn from the fiery energy of his 
soul and the rapidity of his destructive march. In the fourteen years 
of his reign 7 he incessantly moved at the head of his armies, from 
Boursa to Adrianople, from the Danube to the Euphrates; and, though 
he strenuously laboured for the propagation of the law, he invaded, with 
impartial ambition, the Christian and Mohammedan princes of Europe 
and Asia. From Angora to Amasia and Erzeroum, the northern regions 
of Anatolia were reduced to his obedience: he stripped of their heredi- 
tary possessions his brother emirs of Ghermian and Caramania, of Aidin 
and Sarukhan; and after the conquest of Iconium the ancient kingdom 
of the Seljukians again revived in the Ottoman dynasty. Nor were the 
conquests of Bajazet less rapid or important in Europe. No sooner had 
he imposed a regular form of servitude on the Servians and Bulgarians 
than he passed the Danube to seek new enemies and new subjects in 
the heart of Moldavia. 58 Whatever yet adhered to the Greek empire 
in Thrace, Macedonia, and Thessaly, acknowledged a Turkish master: 
an obsequious bishop led him through the gates of Thermopylae into 
Greece; and we may observe, as a singular fact, that the widow of a 
Spanish chief, who possessed the ancient seat of the oracle of Delphi, 
deserved his favour by the sacrifice of a beauteous daughter. The 
Turkish communication between Europe and Asia had been dangerous 
and doubtful, till he stationed at Gallipoli a fleet of galleys, to command 
the Hellespont and intercept the Latin succours of Constantinople. 
While the monarch indulged his passions in a boundless range of injus-

According to another story, the sultan was stabbed by a Croat in his tent; 
and this accident was alleged to Busbequius (Epist. i. p. 98) as an excuse 
for the unworthy precaution of pinioning, as it were, between two attendants, 
an ambassador's arms, when he is introduced to the royal presence. 

CT The reign of Bajazet L, or Ilderim Bayazid, is contained in Cantemir 
(p. 46), the second, book of Chalcocondyles, and the Annales Turcici. The 
surname of Ilderim, or lightning, is an example that the conquerors and 
poets of every age have felt the truth of a system which derives the sublime 
from the principle of terror.

tice and cruelty, he imposed on his soldiers the most rigid laws of 
modesty and abstinence; and the harvest was peaceably reaped and 
sold within the precincts of his camp. Provoked by the loose and cor- 
rupt administration of justice, he collected in a house the judges and 
lawyers of his dominions, who expected that in a few moments the fire 
would be kindled to reduce them to ashes. His ministers trembled in 
silence: but an Ethiopian buffoon presumed to insinuate the true cause 
of the evil; and future venality was left without excuse by annexing an 
adequate salary to the office of cadhi. 68 The humble title of emir was 
no longer suitable to the Ottoman greatness; and Bajazet condescended 
to accept a patent of sultan from the caliphs who served in Egypt under 
the yoke of the Mamalukes: 00 a last and frivolous homage that was 
yielded by force to opinion; by the Turkish conquerors to the house 
of Abbas and the successors of the Arabian prophet. The ambition of 
the sultan was inflamed by the obligation of deserving this august 
title; and he turned his arms against the kingdom of Hungary, the per- 
petual theatre of the Turkish victories and defeats. Sigismond, the 
Hungarian king, was the son and brother of the emperors of the West: 
his cause was that of Europe and the church; and, on the report of 
his danger, the bravest knights of France and Germany were eager to 
march under his standard and that of the cross. In the battle of Nicop- 
olis Bajazet defeated a confederate army of a hundred thousand Chris- 
tians, who had proudly boasted that if the sky should fall they could 
uphold it on their lances. The far greater part were slain or driven into 
the Danube; and Sigismond, escaping to Constantinople by the river 
and the Black Sea, returned after a long circuit to his exhausted king- 
dom. 61 In the pride of victory Bajazet threatened that he would be- 
siege Buda; that he would subdue the adjacent countries of Germany 
and Italy; and that he would feed his horse with a bushel of oats on 
the altar of St. Peter at Rome. His progress was checked, not by the 
miraculous interposition of the apostle, not by a crusade of the Chris- 
tian powers, but by a long and painful fit of the gout. The disorders 
of the moral are sometimes corrected by those of the physical world; 
and an acrimonious humour' falling on a single fibre of one man may 
prevent or suspend the misery of nations. 
Such is the general idea of the Hungarian war; but the disastrous

adventure of the French has procured us some memorials which illus- 
trate the victory and character of Bajazet. 6 -' The duke of Burgundy, 
sovereign of Flanders and uncle of Charles the Sixth, yielded to the 
ardour of his son, John count of Nevers; and the fearless youth was 
accompanied by four princes, his cousins, and those of the French mon- 
arch. Their inexperience was guided by the Sire de Coucy, one of the 
best and oldest captains of Christendom; 68 but the constable, admiral, 
and marshal of France 64 commanded an army which did not exceed 
the number of a thousand knights and squires. These splendid names 
were the source of presumption and the bane of discipline. So many 
might aspire to command, that none were willing to obey; their na- 
tional spirit despised both their enemies and their allies; and in the 
persuasion that Bajazet would fly, or must fall, they began to compute 
how soon they should visit Constantinople and deliver the holy sepul- 
chre. When their scouts announced the approach of the Turks, the 
gay and thoughtless youths were at table, already heated with wine: 
they instantly clasped their armour, mounted their horses, rode full 
speed to the vanguard, and resented as an affront the advice of Sigis- 
mond, which would have deprived them of the right and honour of the 
foremost attack. The battle of Nicopolis would not have been lost if 
the French would have obeyed the prudence of the Hungarians: but 
it might have been gloriously won had the Hungarians imitated the 
valour of the French. They dispersed the first line, consisting of the 
troops of Asia; forced a rampart of stakes which had been planted 
against the cavalry; broke, after a bloody conflict, the Janizaries them- 
selves; and were at length overwhelmed by the numerous squadrons 
that issued from the woods and charged on all sides this handful of 
intrepid warriors. In the speed and secrecy of his march, in the order 
and evolutions of the battle, his enemies felt and admired the military 
talents of Bajazet. They accuse his cruelty in the use of victory. After 
reserving the count of Nevers and four-and-twenty lords, whose birth 
and riches were attested by his Latin interpreters, the remainder of the 

"I should not complain of the labour of this work, if my materials were 
always derived from such books as the Chronicle of honest Froissard (vol. 
iv. c. 67, 69, 72, 74, 79-83, 85, 87, 89), who read little, inquired much, and 
"believed all. The original Memoires of the Marechal de Boucicault (partie 
i. c. 22-28) add some facts, but they are dry and deficient, if compared 
with the pleasant garrulity of Froissard. 

"An accurate Memoir on the Life of Enguerrand VII., Sire de Coucy, 
has been given by the Baron de Zurlauben (Hist, de T Academic des In- 
scriptions, torn. xxv.). His rank and possessions were equally considerable 
in France and England; and, in 1375, he led an army of adventurers into 
Switzerland, to recover a large patrimony which he claimed in right ai 
his grandmother, the daughter of the emperor Albert I. of Austria (Sinner, 
Voyage dans la Suisse Occidentale, torn. i. p. 118-124). 

64 That military office, so respectable at present, was still more conspicuous 
when it was divided between two persons (Daniel, Hist, de la Milice Fran- 
Qoise, torn ii^p. 5). One of these, the marshal of the crusade, was the 
famous Boucicault, who afterwards defended Constantinople, governed 
Genoa, invaded the coast of Asia, and died in the field of Azincour.

before his throne; and, as they refused to abjure their faith, were suc- 
cessively beheaded in his presence. The sultan was exasperated by 
the loss of his bravest Janizaries; and if it be true that, on the eve of 
the engagement, the French had massacred their Turkish prisoners, 66 
they might impute to themselves the consequences of a just retaliation. 
A knight, whose life had been spared, was permitted to return to Paris, 
that he .might relate the deplorable tale, and solicit the ransom -of the 
uoble captives. In the meanwhile the count of Nevers, with the princes 
and barons of France, were dragged along in the marches of the Turk- 
ish camp, exposed as a grateful trophy to the Moslems of Europe and 
Asia, and strictly confined at Boursa as of ten as Bajazet resided in his 
capital. The sultan was pressed each day to ^expiate with their blood 
the blood of his martyrs; but he had pronounced that they should live, 
and either for mercy or destruction his word was irrevocable. He was 
assured of their value and importance by the return of the messenger, 
and the gifts and intercessions of the kings of France and of Cyprus. 
Lusignan presented him with a gold saltcellar of .curious workmanship, 
and of the price of ten thousand ducats; and Charles the Sixth de- 
spatched by the way of Hungary a cast of Norwegian hawks, and .six 
horse-loads of scarlet cloth, of fine linen of Rheims, and of Arras tap- 
estry, representing the battles of the great Alexander. After much de- 
lay, the effect of distance rather than of art, Bajazet agreed to accept 
a ransom of two hundred thousand ducats for the connt of .Nevers and 
the surviving princes and barons: the .marshal Boucicault, a famous 
warrior, was of the number of the fortunate; but the admiral of France 
had been slain in the battle; and the constable, with the Sire de Coucy, 
died in the prison of Boursa. This heavy demand, which was doubled 
by incidental costs, fell chiefly on the duke of Burgundy, -or rather on 
his Flemish subjects, who were bound by the feudal laws to contribute 
for the knighthood and captivity of the eldest son of their lord. For 
the faithful discharge of the debt some merchants of Genoa -gave se- 
curity to the amount of five times the sum; a lesson to those warlike 
times, that commerce and credit are the links of the society -of nations. 
It had been stipulated in the treaty that the French captives should 
swear never to bear arms against the person of their conqueror; but 
the ungenerous restraint was abolished by Bajazet himself. " I de- 
spise," said he to the heir of Burgundy, " thy oaths and thy arms. 
Thou art young, and mayest be ambitious of effacing the disgrace or 
misfortune of thy first chivalry. Assemble thy powers, proclaim thy 
design, and be assured that Bajazet will rejoice to meet thee a second 
time in a field of battle." Before their departure they were indulged 
in flie freedom and hospitality of the court of Boursa. The French 
princes admired the magnificence of the Ottoman, whose hunting and 
hawking equipage was composed of seyen thousand huntsmen and seven

thousand falconers. 00 In their presence, and at his command^ the belly 
of one of his chamberlains was cut open, on a complaint against him 
for drinking the goat's milk of a poor woman. The strangers were 
astonished by this act of justice; but it was the justice of a sultan who 
disdains to balance the weight of evidence or to measure the degrees of 
guilt. 

After his enfranchisement from an oppressive guardian, John Palae- 
ologus remained thirty-six years the helpless, and, as it, should seem, 
the careless, spectator of the public ruin. 07 Love, or rather liist, was 
his only vigorous passion; and in the embraces of the wives and virgins 
of the city the Turkish slave forgot the dishonour of the emperor of 
the Romans,. Andronicus, his eldest son, had formed, at Adrianople, 
an intimate and guilty friendship with Sauzes, the son of Amurath,; 
and the two youths conspired against the authority and lives of their 
parents. The presence of Amurath in Europe soon discovered and dis- 
sipated their rash counsels; and, after depriving Sauzes of his sight, 
the Ottoman threatened his vassal with the treatment of an accomplice 
and an enemy unless he inflicted a similar punishment on his own son. 
Palaeologus trembled and obeyed, and a cruel precaution involved in 
the same sentence the childhood and innocence of John the son of the 
criminal. But the operation was so mildly or so unskilfully performed 
that the one retained the sight of an eye, and the other was afflicted 
only with the infirmity of squinting. Thus excluded from the succes- 
sion, the two princes were confined in the tower, of Anema; and the 
piety of Manuel, the second son of the reigning monarch, was re- 
warded with the gift of the Imperial crown. But at the end of two 
years the turbulence of the Latins and the levity of the Greeks pro- 
duced a revolution, and the two emperors were buried in the tower 
from whence the two prisoners were exalted to the throne. Another 
period of two years afforded Palaeologus and Manuel the means of 
escape; it was contrived fay the magic or subtlety of a monk, who was 
alternately named the angel or the devil; they fled to Scutari; their 
adherents armed in their cause, and the two Byzantine factions dis- 
played the ambition and animosity with which Caesar and Pompey had 
disputed the empire of the world. The Roman world was now con* 
tracted to a corner of Thrace, between the Propontis and the Black 
Sea, about fifty miles in length and thirty in breadth: a space of ground 
not more extensive, than the lesser principalities of Germany or Italy,

round number of 12,000 officers and servants of the chase. . A part of his 
spoils was afterwards displayed in a hunting-match of Timour: I, hounds 
with satin housings; 2, leopards with collars set with jewels; 3, Grecian 
greyhounds; and 4, dogs from Europe, as strong as African lions (idem, 
1. vi. c. 15). Bajazet was particularly fond of flying his hawks at cranes 
(Chalcocondyles, L ii. p. 35 [p. 67, ed. Bonn]).

652 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

if the remains of Constantinople had not still represented the wealth 
and populousness of a kingdom. To restore the public peace it was 
found necessary to divide this fragment of the empire; and while Pa- 
Iseologus and Manuel were left in possession of the capital, almost all 
that lay without the walls was ceded to the blind princes, Tvho fixed 
their residence at Rhodosto and Selymbria. In the tranquil slumber 
of royalty the passions of John Palaeologus survived his reason and his 
strength: he deprived his favourite and heir of a blooming princess of 
Trebizond; and while the feeble emperor laboured to consummate his 
nuptials, Manuel, with a hundred of the noblest Greeks, was sent on a 
peremptory summons to the Ottoman Porte. They served with hon- 
our in the wars of Bajazet; but a plan of fortifying Constantinople ex- 
cited his jealousy; he threatened their lives; the new works were in- 
stantly demolished; and we shall bestow a praise, perhaps above the 
merit of Palseologus, if we impute this last humiliation as the cause of 
his death. 

The earliest intelligence of that event was communicated to Manuel, 
who escaped with speed and secrecy from the palace of Boursa to the 
Byzantine throne. Bajazet affected a proud indifference at the loss of 
this valuable pledge; and while he pursued his conquests in Europe 
and Asia, he left the emperor to struggle with his blind cousin John of 
Selymbria, who, in eight years of civil war, asserted his right of primo- 
geniture. At length the ambition of the victorious sultan pointed to 
the conquest of Constantinople: but he listened to the advice of his 
vizir, who represented that such an enterprise might unite the powers 
of Christendom in a second and more formidable crusade. His epistle 
to the emperor was conceived in these words: " By the divine clem- 
ency, our invincible scimitar has reduced to our obedience almost all 
Asia, with many and large countries in Europe, excepting only the city 
of Constantinople; for beyond the walls thou hast nothing left. Re- 
sign that city; stipulate thy reward; or tremble, for thyself and thy 
unhappy people, at the consequences of a rash refusal." But his am- 
bassadors were instructed to soften their tone, and to propose a treaty, 
which was subscribed with submission and gratitude. A truce of ten 
years was purchased by an annual tribute of thirty thousand crowns 
of gold; the Greeks deplored the public toleration of the law of Mo- 
hammed; and Bajazet enjoyed the glory of establishing a Turkish 
cadhi, and founding a royal mosque, in the metropolis of the Eastern 
church. 68 Yet this truce was soon violated by the restless sultan; in 
the cause of the prince of Selymbria, the lawful emperor, an army of 
Ottomans again threatened Constantinople, and the distress of Manuel 
implored the protection of the king of France. His plaintive embassy 
obtained much pity and some relief, and the conduct of the succour &lt;

was intrusted to the marshal Boucicault, 69 whose religious chivalry was 
inflamed by the desire of revenging his captivity on the infidels. He 
sailed, with four ships of war, from Aiguesmortes to the Hellespont; 
forced the passage, which was guarded by seventeen Turkish galleys; 
landed at Constantinople a supply of six hundred men-at-arms and 
sixteen hundred archers, and reviewed them in the adjacent plain with- 
out condescending to number or array the multitude of Greeks. By 
his presence the blockade was raised both by sea and land; the flying 
squadrons of Bajazet were driven to a more respectful distance; and 
several castles in Europe and Asia were stormed by the emperor and 
the marshal, who fought with equal valour by each other's side. But 
the Ottomans soon returned with an increase of numbers; and the in- 
trepid Boucicault, after a year's struggle, resolved to evacuate a coun- 
try which could no longer afford either pay or provisions for his sol- 
diers. The marshal offered to conduct Manuel to the French court, 
where he might solicit in person a supply of men and money; and ad- 
vised, in the meanwhile, that, to extinguish all domestic discord, he 
should leave his blind competitor on the throne. The proposal was 
embraced: the prince of Selymbria was introduced to the capital; ant! 
such was the public misery that the lot of the exile seemed more for- 
tunate than that of the sovereign. Instead of applauding the success of 
his vassal, the Turkish sultan claimed the city as his own; and, on the 
refusal of the emperor John, Constantinople was more closely pressea 
by the calamities of war and famine. Against such an enemy prayers 
and resistance were alike unavailing; and the savage would have de- 
voured his prey if, in the fatal moment, he had not been overthrown 
by another savage stronger than himself. By the victory of Timour 
or Tamerlane the fall of Constantinople was delayed about fifty years; 
and this important though accidental service may justly introduce the 
life and character of the Mogul conqueror.

THE conquest and monarchy of the world was the first object of the 
ambition of TMOUR. To live in the memory and esteem of future ages 
was the second wish of his magnanimous spirit. All the civil and mili- 
tary transactions of his reign were diligently recorded in the journals 
of his secretaries: * the authentic narrative was revised by the persons

best informed of each particular transaction; and it is believed in the 
empire and family of Timour that the monarch himself composed the 
commentaries 2 of his life and the institutions 3 of his government. 4 But 
these cares were ineffectual for the preservation of his fame, and these 
precious memorials in the Mogul or Persian language were concealed 
from the world, or, at least, from the knowledge of Europe. The na- 
tions which he vanquished exercised a base and impotent revenge; and 
ignorance has long repeated the tale of calumny 5 which had disfigured 
the birth and character, the person, and even the name, of Tamerlane* 

Timour Beg, which has been translated into French by M. Petit de la Croix 
(Paris, 1722, in 4 vols. I2mo), and has always been my faithful guide. 
His geography and chronology are wonderfully accurate; and he. may be 
trusted for public facts, though he servilely praises the virtue and fortune 
of . the hero. Timour's attention to procure intelligence from his own and 
foreign countries may be seen in the Institutions, p. 215, 217, 349, 351. 

a These Commentaries are yet unknown in Europe: but Mr. White gives 
some hope that they may be imported and translated by his friend Major 
Davy, who had read in the East this "minute and faithful narrative of an 
interesting and eventful period." 

*I am ignorant whether the original institution, in the Turki or Mogul 
language, be still extant. The Persic version, with an English translation, 
and most valuable index, was published (Oxford, 1783, in 4to) by the joint 
labours of Major Davy and Mr. White the Arabic professor. This work 
has been since translated from tibe Persic into French (Paris, 1787) by 
U. Langles, a learned Orientalist, who has added the Life of Timour and 
many curious notes. 

4 Shaw Allum, the present Mogul, reads, values, but cannot imitate, the 
institutions of his great ancestor. The English translator relies on their 
internal evidence; but if any suspicion should arise of fraud and fiction, 
they will not be dispelled by Major Davy's letter. The Orientals have 
never cultivated the art of criticism; the patronage of a prince, less honour- 
able perhaps, is not less lucrative than that of a bookseller; nor can it 
be deemed incredible that a Persian, the real author, should renounce the 
credit, to raise the value and price, of the work. 

"The original of the tale is found in the following work, which is much 
esteemed for its florid elegance of style: Ahmedis Arabsiadce (Ahmed Ebn 
Arabshah) Vita et Rerum Gestarum Ttmuri. Arabice et Latine. Edidit 
Samuel Henricus Manger. Franequerce, 1767, 2 torn, in 4to. This Syrian 
author is ever a malicious, and often an ignorant, enemy: the very titles 
of his chapters are injurious; as how the wicked, as how the impious, as 
how the viper, etc. The copious article of TIMUR, in Bibliotheque Orien- 
tale, is of a mixed nature, as D'Herbelot indifferently draws his materials 
(p. 877-888) from Khondemir, Ebn Schounah, and the Lebtarikh. 

*Demtr or Timour signifies, in the Turkish language, Iron; and Beg is 
the appellation of a lord or prince. By the change of a letter or accent it 
is changed into Lenc or Lame; and a European corruption confounds the 
two words in the name of Tamerlane. 

'The extraordinary stories that were told about Timour did not even 
omit his birth. According to his Memoirs he was so called by a sheikh 
who, when visited by his mother on the day after the future conqueror's 
birth, was reading the verse of the Koran, "Are you sure that He who 
dwelleth in heaven will not cause the earth to swallow you up? and, 
behold, it shall shake, Tamaru." The sheikh then stopped and said, "We 
have named your son Timour." His lameness has been cited as matter 
for reproach. He was lamed by an arrow wound at the siege of the capital 
of Sistan when he was over-running the countries south of the Oxus. 0. S.] 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 65$ 

Yet his real merit would be enhanced rather than debased by the eleva- 
tion of a peasant to the throne of Asia; nor can his lameness be a theme 
of reproach, unless he had the weakness to blush at a natural, or per- 
haps an honourable, infirmity. 

In the eyes of the Moguls, who held the indefeasible succession of 
the house of Zingis, he was doubtless a rebel subject; yet he sprang 
from the noble tribe of Berlass: his fifth ancestor, Carashar Nevian, 
had been the vizir of Zagatai, in his realm of Transoxiana; and in the 
ascent of some generations, the branch of Timour is confounded, at 
least by the females, 7 with the Imperial stem. 8 He was born forty 
miles to the south of Samarcand, in the village of Sebzar, in the fruit- 
ful territory of Cash, of which his fathers were the hereditary chiefs, 
as well as of a toman of ten thousand horse. 9 His birth 10 was cast on 
one of those periods of anarchy which announce the fall of the Asiatic 
dynasties, and open a new field to adventurous ambition. The khans 
of Zagatai were extinct; the emirs aspired to independence, and their 
domestic feuds could only be suspended by the conquest and tyranny 
of the khans of Kashgar, who, with an army of Getes or Calmucks, 11 
invaded the Transoxian kingdom. From the twelfth year of his age Ti- 
mour had entered the field of action; in the twenty-fifth he stood forth 
as the deliverer of his country, and the eyes and wishes of the people 
were turned towards a hero who suffered in their cause. 12 The chiefs of 

T After relating some false and foolish tales of Timour Lenc, Arabshah is 
compelled to speak truth, and to own him for a kinsman of Zingis, per 
mulieres (as he peevishly adds) laqueos Satanae (pars i. c. i. p. 25). The 
testimony of Abulghazi Khan (P. ii. c. 5, P. v. c. 4) is clear, unquestion- 
able, and decisive. 

8 According to one of the pedigrees, the fourth ancestor of Zingis, and 
the ninth of Timour, were brothers; and they agreed that the posterity of 
the elder should succeed to the dignity of khan, and that the descendants 
of the younger should fill the office of their minister and general. This 
tradition was at least convenient to justify the first steps of Tiraour's 
ambition (Institutions, p. 24 25, from the MS. fragments of Timour's 
History).

prophets, Timour derived the surname of Saheb Keran, or master of the 
conjunctions (Biblioth. Orient p. 878). 

n ln the Institutions of Timour, these subjects of the khan of Kashgar 
are most improperly styled Ouzbegs or Uzbeks, a name which belongs to 
another branch and country of Tartars (Abulghazi, P. v. c. v. 5; P. vii. c. 5). 
Could I be sure that this word is in the Turkish original, I would boldly 
pronounce^ that the Institutions were framed a century after the death o"f 
Timour, since the establishment of the Uzbeks in Transoxiana.

the law and of the army had pledged their salvation to support him with 
their lives and fortunes, but in the hour of danger they were silent and 
afraid; and, after waiting seven days on the hills of Samarcand, he re- 
treated to the desert with only sixty horsemen. The fugitives were 
overtaken by a thousand Getes, whom he repulsed with incredible 
slaughter; and his enemies were forced to exclaim, " Timour is a won- 
derful man: fortune and the divine favour are with him." But in this 
bloody action his own followers were reduced to ten, a number which 
was soon diminished by the desertion of three Carizmians. He wan- 
dered in the desert with his wife, seven companions, and four horses; 
and sixty-two days was he plunged in a loathsome dungeon, from 
whence he escaped by his own courage and the remorse of the op- 
pressor. 13 After swimming the broad and rapid stream of the Jihoon 
or Oxus, he led, during some months, the life of a vagrant and outlaw 
on the borders of the adjacent states. But his fame shone brighter in 
adversity; he learned to distinguish the friends of his person, the asso- 
ciates of his fortune, and to apply the various characters of men for 
their advantage, and, above all, for his own. On his return to his na- 
tive country Timour was successively joined by the parties of his con- 
federates, who anxiously sought him in the desert; nor can I refuse 
to describe, in his pathetic simplicity, one of their fortunate encounters. 
He presented himself as a guide to three chiefs, who were at the head 
af seventy horse. "When their eyes fell upon me," says Timour, 
" they were overwhelmed with joy, and they alighted from their horses, 
and they came and kneeled, and they kissed my stirrup. I also came 
down from my horse, and took each of them in my arms. And I put 
my turban on the head of the first chief; and my girdle, rich in jewels 
and wrought with gold, I bound on the loins of the second; and the 
third I clothed in my own coat. And they wept, and I wept also; and 
the hour of prayer was arrived, and we prayed. And we mounted our 
horses, and came to my dwelling; and I collected my people, and made 
a feast." His trusty bands were soon increased by the bravest of the 
tribes; he led them against a superior foe, and, after some vicissitudes 
of war, the Getes were finally driven from the kingdom of Transoxiana. 

"At twelve, when but a boy, I fancied that I perceived in myself all the 
signs of greatness and of wisdom, and whoever came to visit me I used to 
receive with great hauteur and dignity." At seventeen he undertook the 
management of the flocks and herds of the family. At nineteen he 
became religious and left off playing chess, made a kind of Buddhist vow 
never to injure living thing, and felt his foot paralysed from having acci- 
dentally trod upon an ant. At twenty thoughts of rebellion and of great- 
ness rose in his mind; at twenty-one he appears to have performed his 
first feat of arms, and he was a practised warrior when he served in his 
twenty-seventh year under emir Houssein. He belonged to the Barlas 
family, which in turn belonged to the famous Turkish sept, the Kurikan 
Clan. He was therefore not a Mongol but a Turk. 0. S.] 

13 [After this imprisonment of sixty-two days in a loathsome dungeon, 
he made a vow to God that though he might be obliged to kill some people 
as a punishment or in self-defence, yet he would never keep any humao 
being in prison or in chains. O. S.J 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE &amp;57 

He had done much for his own glory; but much remained to be done, 
much art to be exerted, and some blood to be spilt, before he could 
teach his equals to obey him as their master. The birth and power of 
emir Houssein compelled him to accept a vicious and unworthy col- 
league, whose sister was the best beloved of his wives. Their union 
was short and jealous; but the policy of Timour, in their frequent 
quarrels, exposed his rival to the reproach of injustice and perfidy, and, 
after a final defeat, Houssein was slain by some sagacious friends, who 
presumed, for the last time, to disobey the commands of their lord. At 
the age of thirty-four, 1 * and in a general diet or couroultai, he was in- 
vested with Imperial command; but he affected to revere the house of 
Zingis; and while the emir Timour reigned over Zagatai and the East, 
a nominal khan served as a private officer in the armies of his servant. 
A fertile kingdom, five hundred miles in length and in breadth, might 
have satisfied the ambition of a subject; but Timour aspired to the do- 
minion of the world, and before his death the crown of Zagatai was one 
of the twenty-seven crowns which he had placed on his head. Without 
expatiating on the victories of thirty-five campaigns; without describing 
the lines of march which he repeatedly traced over the continent of 
Asia; I shall briefly represent his conquests in, I. Persia, II, Tartary, 
and III. India, 15 and from thence proceed to the more interesting nar- 
rative of his Ottoman war. 

I. For every war a motive of safety or revenge, of honour or zeal 
of right or convenience, may be readily found in the jurisprudence of 
conquerors. No sooner had Timour re-united to the patrimony of 
Zagatai the dependent countries of Carizme and Candahar, than he 
turned his eyes towards the kingdoms of Iran or Persia. From the 
Oxus to the Tigris that extensive country was left without a lawful 
sovereign since the death of Abousaid, the last of the descendants of 
the great Holacou. Peace and justice had been banished from the land 
above forty years, and the Mogul invader might seem to listen to the 
cries of an oppressed people. Their petty tyrants might have opposed 
him with confederate arms: they separately stood, and successively 
fell; and the difference of their fate was only marked by the prompti- 
tude of submission or the obstinacy of resistance. Ibrahim, prince of 
Shirwan or Albania, kissed the footstool of the Imperial throne. His 
peace-offerings of silks, horses, and jewels, were composed, according 
to the Tartar fashion, each article of nine pieces; but a critical specta- 
tor observed that there were only eight slaves. "I myself am the 
ninth," replied Ibrahim, who was prepared for the remark, and his 

"The first book of Sherefeddin is employed on the private life of the 
hero; and he himself, or his secretary (Institutions, p. 3-77), enlarges with 
pleasure on the thirteen designs and enterprises which most truly constitute 
his personal merit. It even shines through the dark colouring of Arabshah 
(P. i. c. 1-12).

second and third books of Sherefeddin, and by Arabshah (c. 13-55). Con-

flattery was rewarded by the smile of Timour. 16 Shah Mansour, prince 
of Fars, or the proper Persia, was one of the least powerful, but most 
dangerous, of his enemies. In a battle, under the walls of Shiraz, he 
broke, with three or four thousand soldiers, the coul or main-body of 
thirty thousand horse, where the emperor fought in person. No more 
than fourteen or fifteen guards remained near the standard of Timour; 
he stood firm as a rock, and received on his helmet two weighty strokes 
of a scimitar; 17 the Moguls rallied; the head of Mansour was thrown 
at his feet; and he declared his esteem of the valour of a foe by ex- 
tirpating all the males of so intrepid a race. From Shiraz his troops 
advanced to the Persian Gulf, and the richness and weakness of Or- 
muz 18 were displayed in an annual tribute of six hundred thousand 
dinars of gold. Bagdad was no longer the city of peace, the seat of 
the caliphs; but the noblest conquest of Holacou could not be over- 
looked by his ambitious successor. The whole course of the Tigris and 
Euphrates, from the mouth to the sources of those rivers, was reduced 
to his obedience; he entered Edessa; and the Turkmans of the black 
sheep were chastised for the sacrilegious pillage of a caravan of Mecca. 
In the mountains of Georgia the native Christians still braved the law 
and the sword of Mohammed; by three expeditions he obtained the 
merit of the gazie., or holy war; and the prince of Teflis -became his 
proselyte and friend. 

H. A just retaliation might be urged for the invasion of Turkestan, 
or the Eastern Tartary. The dignity of Timour could not endure the 
impunity of the Getes: he passed the Sflioon, subdued the kingdom of 
Kashgar, and marched seven times into the heart of their country. His 
most distant camp was two months' journey, or four hundred and eighty 
leagues, to the north-east of Samarcand; and his emirs, who traversed 
the river Irtish, engraved in the forests of Siberia a rude memorial of 
their exploits. The conquest of Kipzak, or the western Tartary, 10 was 

"The reverence of^ the Tartars -for the mysterious number of nine is 
declared by Abulghazi Khan, who, for that reason, divides his Genealogical 
History into nine parts. 

17 According to Arabshah (P. I. c. 28, p. 183), the coward Timour ran 
away to -his -tent, and hid himself from 'the pursuit of Shah Mansour under 
the women's garments. Perhaps Sherefeddin (], iiL c. 25) has magnified 
his courage. 

36 The history oi Ormuz is not unlike that of Tyre. The old city, on the 
continent, was destroyed by the Tartars, and renewed in a neighbouring 
island without fresh water 'or vegetation. The kings of Ormuz, rich in the 
Indian trade and the "pearl fishery, possessed large territories both in Persia 
and Arabia; but they were at first the tributaries of the sultans of Kerman, 
and at last were delivered (AJ). 1505) by the Portuguese tyrants from the 
tyranny of their own vizirs (Marco Polo, 1. i. c. 15, 16, fol. 7, 8; Abulfeda, 
Geograph. tabul. xi. p. 261, 262 ; an original Chronicle of Ormuz, in Texeira, 
or Stevens' History of Persia, p. 376-4*6; and the Itineraries inserted in 
the first volume of Ramusio; of Ludovico Barthema, 1503, fol 167,; of 
Andrea Corsali, 1517, fol. 202, 203; and of Odoardo Barbessa, in 1516,

founded on the double motive of aiding the distressed, and chastising 
the ungrateful. Toctamish, a fugitive prince, was entertained ^ and 
protected in his court: the ambassadors of Auruss Khan were dismissed 
with a haughty denial, and followed on the same day by the armies of 
Zagatai; and their success established Toctamish in the Mogul empire 
of the North. But, after a reign of ten years, the new khan forgot the 
merits and the strength of his benefactor; the base usurper, as he 
deemed him, of the sacred rights of the house of Zingis. Through- the 
gates of Dferbend he entered Persia at the head of ninety thousand 
horse: with the innumerable forces of Kipzak, Bulgaria, Circassia, and 
Russia, he passed the Sihoon, burnt the palaces of Timour, and com- 
pelled him, amidst the winter snows, to contend for Samarcand- and' his 
life. After a mild expostulation, and a glorious victory, the emperor 
resolved on revenge: and by the east, and the west, of the Caspian, and 
the Volga, he twice invaded Kipzak with- such mighty powers, that thir- 
teen miles were measured from his- right to his left wing. In a march 
of five months they rarely beheld the footsteps of man: and their daily 
subsistence was often trusted to the fortune of the chase. At length 
the armies encountered each other; but the treachery of the standard- 
bearer 1 , who, in the- heat of action, reversed the Imperial standard of, 
Kipzak determined the victory of the Zagatais; and Toctamish (I 
speak- the language of the Institutions) gave the tribe of Toushi to 
the wind of desolation. 20 He fled to the Christian dube of Lithuania;, 
again returned 1 to^ the banks of the Volga; and, after fifteen 1 battles 
with a domestic rival, at last perished in the wilds of Siberia: The, 
pursuit of a flying enemy carried Timour into the tributary provinces 
of Russiar a. duke of the reigning family was made- prisoner amidst the 
ruins- of his- capital; and Yeletz; by the pride and ignorance of ths 
Orientals', might easily be confounded with the genuine metropolis of 
the nation. Moscow trembled at the. approach of the Tartar-, and the 
resistance would have been feeble- since, the. hopes, of the: Russians 
were placed in a miraculous image- of the Virgin, to whose protection 
they ascribed the casual and- voluntary- retreat of the conqueror Am- 
bition and prudence recalled him to the, South, the desolate country 
was exhausted, and the Mogul soldiers were enriched with an immense? 
spoil of precious furs, of linen of Antioch, 21 and of ingots of goltf and 
silver. 221 On the banks- of the Doir, or Tanais-,, he received a Humble

some animadversion, on the superficial account of Snerefeddin (I. Hi 1 , c. 12, 
I3&gt; 14), who was ignorant of the designs of Timour 'and the truer springs of 
action. 

81 The furs of Russia are more credible than the- ingots-. But the Imen of 
Antioch has never been famous; and Antioch was- fir ruins 1 . I suspect 
that it was some manufacture of Europe, which the Hanse. merchants had 1

deputation from the consiJs and merchants of Egypt, 23 Venice, Genoa, 
Catalonia, and Biscay, who occupied the commerce and city of Tana, 
or Azoph, at the mouth of the river. They offered their gifts, admired 
his magnificence, and trusted his royal word. But the peaceful visit 
of an emir, who explored the state of the magazines and harbour, was 
speedily followed by the destructive presence of the Tartars. The city 
was reduced to ashes; the Moslems were pillaged and dismissed; but 
all the Chrisians who had not fled to their ships were condemned either 
to death or slavery. 24 Revenge prompted him to burn the cities of 
Serai and Astrachan, the monuments of rising civilisation; and his 
vanity proclaimed that he had penetrated to the region of perpetual 
daylight, a strange phenomenon, which authorised his Mohammedan 
doctors to dispense with the obligation of evening prayer. 25 

III. When Timour first proposed to his princes and emirs the inva- 
sion of India or Hindostan, 26 he was answered by a murmur of discon- 
tent: "The rivers! and the mountains and deserts I and the soldiers 
dad in armour! and the elephants, destroyers of men! " But the dis- 
pleasure of the emperor was more dreadful than all these terrors; and 
his superior reason was convinced that an enterprise of such tremen- 
dous aspect was safe and easy in the execution. He was informed by 
his spies of the weakness and anarchy of Hindostan: the soubahs ot 
the provinces had erected the standard of rebellion: and the perpetual 
Infancy of. sultan Mahmoud was despised even in the harem of Delhi. 
The Mogul army moved in three great divisions; and Timour observes 
with pleasure that the ninety-two squadrons of a thousand horse most 
fortunately corresponded with the ninety-two names or epithets of the 
prophet Mohammed. Between the Jihoon and the Indus they crossed 
one of the ridges of mountains which are styled by the Arabian geogra- 
phers The Stony Girdles of the Earth. The highland robbers were 

Sherefeddin, and marked the true limit of Timour*s conquests. His argu- 
ments are superfluous; and a simple appeal to the Russian annals is suffi- 
cient to prove that Moscow, which six years before had been taken by 
Toctamish, escaped the arms of a more formidable invader. 

88 An Egyptian consul from Grand Cairo is mentioned in Barbaro's Voy- 
age to Tana in 1436, after the city had been rebuilt (Rarausio, torn. ii. 
fol. 92). 

34 The sack of Azoph is described by Sherefeddin (1. iii. c. 55), and much 
more particularly by the author of an Italian chronicle (Andreas de Redusiis 
de Quero, in Chron. Tarvisiano, in Muratori, Script. Rerum Italicarum, 
torn. xix. p. 802-805). He had conversed with the Mianis, two Venetian 
brothers, one of whom had been sent a deputy to the camp of Timour, 
and the other had lost at Azoph three sons and 12,000 ducats. 

88 Sherefeddin only says (1. iii. c. 13) that the rays of the setting, and those 
of the rising sun, were scarcely separated by any interval; a problem 
which may be solved, in the latitude of Moscow (the 56th degree), with the 
aid of the Aurora Borealis and a long summer twilight. But a day of forty 
days (Khondemir apud D'Herbelot, p. 880) would rigorously confine us 
within the polar circle. 

**For the Indian war, see the Institutions (p. 129-139), the fourth book 
of Sherefeddin, and the history of Ferishta (in Dow, voL ii. p, 1-20), which 
throws a general %Ht on the affairs of Hindostan.

subdued or extirpated; but great numbers of men and horses perished 
in the snow; the emperor himself was let down a precipice on a port- 
able scaffold the ropes were one hundred and filty cubits in length; 
and before he could reach the bottom, this dangerous operation was 
five times repeated. Timour crossed the Indus at the ordinary passage 
of Attok; and successively traversed, in the footsteps of Alexander, 
the Punjab, or five rivers, 27 that fall into the master stream. From 
Attok to Delhi the high road measures no more than six hundred miles; 
but the two conquerors deviated to the south-east; and the motive of 
Timour was to join his grandson, who had achieved by his command 
the conquest of Moultan. On the eastern bank of the Hyphasis, on 
the edge of the desert, the Macedonian hero halted and wept: the Mo- 
gul entered the desert, reduced the fortress of Batnir, and stood in 
arms before the gates of Delhi, a great and flourishing city, which had 
subsisted three centuries under the dominion of the Mohammedan 
kings. The siege, more especially of the castle, might have been a 
work of time; but he tempted, by the appearance of weakness, the 
sultan Mahmoud and his vizir to descend into the plain, with ten 
thousand cuirassiers, forty thousand of his foot-guards, and one hun- 
dred and twenty elephants, whose tusks are said to have been armed 
with sharp and poisoned daggers. Against these monsters, or rather 
against the imagination of his troops, he condescended to use some 
extraordinary precautions of fire and a ditch, of iron spikes and a 
rampart of bucklers; but the event taught the Moguls to smile at their 
own fears; and as soon as these unwieldy animals were routed, the 
inferior species (the men of India) disappeared from the field. Ti- 
mour made his triumphal entry into the capital of Hindostan; and. ad- 
mired, with a view to imitate, the architecture of the stately mosque; 
but the order or licence of a general pillage and massacre polluted the 
festival of his victory. He resolved to purify his soldiers in the blood 
of the idolators, or Gentoos, who still surpass, in the proportion of ten 
to one, the numbers of the Moslems. In this pious design he advanced 
one hundred miles to the north-east of Delhi, passed the Ganges, fought 
several battles by land and water, and penetrated to the famous rock 
of Coupde, the statue of the cow, that seems to discharge the mighty 
river, whose source is far distant among the mountains of Thibet. 28 
His return was along the skirts of the northern hills; nor could this 

"The rivers of the Punjab, the five eastern branches of the Indus, have 
been laid down for the first time with truth and accuracy in Major Rennell's 
incomparable map of Hindostan. In his Critical Memoir he illustrates 
with judgment and learning the marches of Alexander and Timour. 

*The two great rivers, the Ganges and Burrampooter, rise in Thibet, 
from the opposite ridges of the same hills, separate from each other to the 
distance of 1200 miles, and, after a winding course of 2000 miles, again 
meet in one point near the gulf of Bengal. Yet so capricious is Fame, thai 
the Burrampooter is a late discovery, while his brother Ganges has been 
the theme of ancient and modern story. Coupele, the scene of Timoi.ir's 
last victory, must be situate near Loldong, iioo miles from Calcutta; and.

66a THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

rapid campaign of one year justify the strange foresight of his emirs, 
that their children in a warm climate would degenerate into a race of 
Hindoos. 

It was on the banks of the Ganges that Timour was informed, by his 
speedy messengers, of the disturbances which had arisen on the con- 
fines of Georgia and Anatolia, of the revolt of the Christians, and the 
ambitious designs of the sultan Bajazet. His vigour of mind and body 
was not impaired by sixty-three years and innumerable fatigues; and, 
after enjoying some tranquil months in the palace of Samarcand, he 
proclaimed a new expedition of seven years into the western countries 
of Asia. 29 To the soldiers who had served in the Indian war he granted 
the choice of remaining at home, or following their prince; but the 
troops of all the provinces and kingdoms of Persia were commanded 
to assemble at Ispahan, and wait the arrival of the Imperial standard. 
It was first directed against the Christians of Georgia, who were strong 
only in their rocks, their castles, and the winter season; but these ob- 
stacles were overcome by the zeal and perseverance of Timour: the 
rebels submitted to the tribute or the Koran; and if both religions 
boasted of their martyrs, that name is more justly due to the Christian 
prisoners, who were offered the choice of abjuration or death. On his 
descent from the hills, the emperor gave audience to the first ambassa- 
dors of Bajazet, and opened the hostile correspondence of complaints 
and menaces which fermented two years before the final explosion. Be- 
tween two jealous and haughty neighbours, the motives of quarrel will 
seldom be wanting. The Mogul and Ottoman conquests now touched 
each other in the neighbourhood of Erzeroum and the Euphrates; nor 
had the doubtful limit been ascertained by time and treaty. Each of 
these ambitious monarchs might accuse his rival of violating his terri- 
tory, of threatening his vassals, and protecting his rebels; and by the 
name of rebels each understood the fugitive princes whose kingdoms 
he had usurped, and whose life or liberty he implacably pursued. The 
resemblance of character was still more dangerous than the opposition 
of interest; and in their victorious career, Timour was impatient of an 
equal, and Bajazet was ignorant of a superior. The first epistle 80 of 
the Mogul emperor must have provoked, instead of reconciling, the 
Turkish sultan, whose family and nation he affected to despise. 31 
" Dost thou not know that the greatest part of Ask is subject to our 

29 See the Institutions, p. 141, to the end of the first book, and Shere- 
feddin (1. .v. c. 1-16) to the entrance of Timour into Syria. 

30 We have three copies of these hostile epistles in the Institutions (p. 147), 
in Sherefeddin (L v. c. 14), and in Arabshah (torn* ii. c. 19, p. 183-201) ; 
which agree with each other in the spirit and substance rather than in the 
style. It is probable that they have been translated, with various latitude, 
from the Turkish t original into the Arabic and Persian tongues. 

The mogul emir distinguishes himself and his countrymen by the name 
of Turks, and stigmatises the race and nation of Bajazet with the less 
honourable epithet of Turkmans, Yet I do not understand how the Otto- 
mans could be descended from a Turkman sailor; those inland shepherd 
were so remote from the sea and all maritime affairs. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 663 

arms and our laws? that our invincible forces extend from one sea to 
the other? that the potentates of the earth form a line before our gate? 
and that we have compelled Fortune herself to watch over the pros- 
perity of our empire? What is the foundation of thy insolence and 
folly? Thou hast fought some battles in the woods of Anatolia; con- 
temptible trophies! Thou hast obtained some victories over the Chris- 
tians of Europe; thy sword was blessed by the apostle of God; and 
thy obedience to the precept of the Koran, in waging war against the 
infidels, is the sole consideration that prevents us from destroying thy 
country, the frontier and bulwark of the Moslem world. Be wise in 
time; reflect; repent; and avert the thunder of our vengeance, which 
is yet suspended over thy head. Thou art no more than a pismire; 
why wilt thou seek to provoke the elephants? Alas! they will trample 
thee under their feet." In his replies Bajazet poured forth the indigna- 
tion of a soul which was deeply stung by such unusual contempt. After 
retorting the basest reproaches on the thief and rebel of the desert, 
the Ottoman recapitulates his boasted victories in Iran, Touran, and 
the Indies; and labours to prove that Timour had never triumphed 
unless by his own perfidy and the vices of his foes. " Thy armies are 
innumerable: be they so; but what are the arrows of the flying Tartar 
against the scimitars and battle-axes of my firm and invincible Jani- 
zaries? I will guard the princes who have implored my protection: 
seek them in my tents. The cities of Arzingan and Erzeroum are mine; 
and unless the tribute be duly paid, I will demand the arrear* under 
the walls of Tauris and Sultania." The ungovernable rage of the sul- 
tan at length betrayed him to an insult of a more domestic kind, " If 
I fly from thy arms," said he, " may my wives be thrice divorced from 
ray bed: but if thou hast not courage to meet me in the field, mayest 
thou again receive thy wives after they have thrice endured the em- 
braces o f a stranger." 82 Any violation by word or deed of the secrecy 
of the harem is an unpardonable offence among the Turkish nations; 83 
and the political quarrel of the two monarchs was embittered by pri- 
vate and personal resentment. Yet in his first expedition Timour was 
satisfied with the siege and destruction of Suvas or Sebaste, a strong 
city on the borders of Anatolia; and he revenged the indiscretion of 
the Ottoman on a garrison of four thousand Armenians, who were 
buried alive for the brave and faithful discharge of their duty. As a 
Musulman he seemed to respect the pious occupation of Bajazet, who 

85 According to the Koran (c. ii. p. 27, and Sale's Discourses, p. 134), a 
Musulman who had thrice divorced his wife (who had thrice repeated the 
words of a divorce) could not take her again till after she had been married 
to^and repudiated by, another husband; an ignominious transaction, which 
it is needless to aggravate by supposing that the first husband must see 
her enjoyed by a second before his face (Rycaut's State of the Ottoman 
Empire, !. ii. c. 21). 

83 The Common delicacy of the Orientals, in never speaking of their 
women, is ascribed in a much higher degree by Arabshah to the Turkish 
nations; and it is remarkable enough that Chalcocondyles (1. ii. p. 55 
[.p. 105, ed. Bonn]) had some knowledge of the prejudice and the insult. 



664 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

was still engaged in the blockade of Constantinople; and after this 
salutary lesson the Mogul conqueror checked his pursuit, and turned 
aside to the invasion of Syria and Egypt. In these transactions, the 
Ottoman prince, by the Orientals, and even by Timour, is styled the 
Kaissar of Roum, the Caesar of the Romans; a title which, by a small 
anticipation, might be given to a monarch who possessed the provinces, 
End threatened the city, of the successors of Constantine. 84 

The military republic of the Mamalukes still reigned in Egypt and 
Syria: but the dynasty of the Turks was overthrown by that of the 
Circassians; 85 and their favourite Barkok, from a slave and a prisoner, 
was raised and restored to the throne. In the midst of rebellion and 
discord, he braved the menaces, corresponded with the enemies, and 
detained the ambassadors, of the Mogul, who patiently expected his 
decease, to revenge the crimes of the father on the feeble reign of his 
son Farage. The Syrian emirs 36 were assembled at Aleppo to repel 
the invasion: they confided in the fame and discipline of the Mama- 
lukes, in the temper of their swords and lances of the purest steel of 
Damascus, in the strength of their walled cities, and in the populous- 
ness of sixty thousand villages; and instead of sustaining a siege, they 
threw open their gates, and arrayed their forces in the plain. But 
these forces were not cemented by virtue and union; and some power- 
ful emirs had been seduced to desert or betray their more loyal com- 
panions. Timour's front was covered with a line of Indian elephants, 
whose turrets were filled with archers and Greek fire: the rapid evolu- 
tions of his cavalry completed the dismay and disorder; the Syrian 
crowds fell back on each other; many thousands were stifled or slaugh- 
tered in the entrance of the great street; the Moguls entered with the 
fugitives; and after a short defence, the citadel, the impregnable cita- 
del of Aleppo, was surrendered by cowardice or treachery. Among the 
suppliants and captives Timour distinguished the doctors of the law, 
whom he invited to the dangerous honour of a personal conference. 87 
The Mogul prince was a zealous Musulman; but his Persian schools 
had taught him to revere the memory of Ali and Hosein; and he had 

84 For the style of the Moguls see the Institutions (p. 131, 147), and for 
the Persians the Bibliotheque Orientale (p. 882) ; but I do not find that the 
title of Caesar has been applied by the Arabians, or assumed by the Otto- 
mans themselves. 

86 See the reigns of Barkok and Faradge, in M. de Guignes (torn. Jv. L 
xxii.), who, from the Arabic texts of Aboulmahasen, Ebn Schounah, and 
Aintabi, has added some facts to our common stock of materials. 

80 For these recent and domestic transactions, Arabshah, though a partial, 
is a credible, witness (torn. i. c. 64-68, torn. ii. c. 1-14). Timour must have 
been odious to a Syrian; but the notoriety of facts would have obliged 
him, in some measure, to respect his enemy and himself. His bitters may 
correct the luscious sweets of Sherefeddin (L v. c. 17-29). 

"These interesting conversations appear to have been copied by Arab- 
shah^ (torn. i. c. 68, p. 625-645) from the cadhi and historian Ebn Schounah, 
a principal actor. Yet how could he be alive seventy-five years afterwards 
(D'Herbelot, p. 792)? 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 665 

imbibed a deep prejudice against the Syrians, as the enemies of the son 
of the daughter of the apostle of God. To these doctors he proposed 
a captious question, which the casuists of Bochara, Samarcand, and 
Herat were incapable of resolving. " Who are the true martyrs, of 
those who are slain on my side, or on that of my enemies? " But he 
was silenced, or satisfied, by the dexterity of one of the cadhis of 
Aleppo, who replied, in the words of Mohammed himself, that the mo- 
tive, not the ensign, constitutes the martyr; and that the Moslems of 
either party, who fight only for the glory of God, may deserve that 
sacred appellation. The true succession of the caliphs was a contro- 
versy of a still more delicate nature; and the frankness of a doctor, too 
honest for his situation, provoked the emperor to exclaim, " Ye are as 
false as those of Damascus: Moawiyah was a usurper, Yezid a tyrant, 
and Ali alone is the lawful successor of the prophet." A prudent ex- 
planation restored his tranquillity; and he passed to a more familiar 
topic of conversation. " What is your age? " said he to the cadhi. 
" Fifty years."" It would be the age of my eldest son: you see me 
here (continued Timour) a poor, lame, decrepit mortal. Yet by my 
arm has the Almighty been pleased to subdue the kingdoms of Iran, 
Touran, and the Indies. I am not a man of blood; and God is my wit- 
ness that in all my wars I have never been the aggressor, and that my 
enemies have always been the authors of their own calamity.'' During 
this peaceful conversation the streets of Aleppo streamed with blood,, 
and re-echoed with the cries of mothers and children, with the shrieks 
of violated virgins. The rich plunder that was abandoned to his sql- 
diers might stimulate their avarice; but their cruelty was enforced by 
the peremptory command of producing an adequate number of heads, 
which, according to his custom, were curiously piled in columns and 
pyramids: the Moguls celebrated the feast of victory, while the sur- 
viving Moslems passed the night in tears and in chains. I shall not 
dwell on the march of the destroyer from Aleppo to Damascus, where 
he was rudely encountered, and almost overthrown, by the armies ^of 
Egypt. A retrograde motion was imputed to his distress and despair: 
one of his nephews deserted to the enemy; and Syria rejoiced in the 
tale of his defeat, when the sultan was driven by the revolt of the 
Mamalukes to escape with precipitation and shame to his palace of 
Cairo. Abandoned by their prince, the inhabitants of Damascus stilt 
defended their walls; and Timour consented to raise the siege, if they 
would adorn his retreat with a gift or ransom; each article of nine 
pieces. But no sooner had he introduced himself into the city, under 
colour of a truce, than he perfidiously violated the treaty; imposed a 
contribution of ten millions of gold; and animated his troops to chas- 
tise the posterity of those Syrians who had executed, or approved, the 
murder of the grandson of Mohammed. A family which had given 
honourable burial to the head of Hosein, and a colony of artificers 
whom he sent to labour at Samarcand, were alone reserved in the gen- 
eral massacre; and after a period of seven centuries Damascus was re-

duced to: ashes r because a Tartar was moved by religious zeal to avenge 
the blood of an Arab. The losses and fatigues of the campaign obliged 
Tiinour to renounce the conquest of Palestine and Egypt; but in his 
return to the Euphrates he delivered Aleppo to the flames; and Justi- 
fied his pious motive by the pardon and reward of two thousand sec- 
taries of Ali ; who were desirous to visit the tomb, of his son. I have 
expatiated on the personal anecdotes which mark the character of the 
Mogul hero; but I shall briefly mention a8 that he erected on the ruins 
of Bagdad a pyramid: of ninety thousand heads; again visited Georgia; 
encamped on the banks of the Araxes; and proclaimed his resolution of 
marching against the Ottoman emperor. Conscious of the importance 
of the war, he collected his forces from every province: eight hundred 
thousand men were enrolled on his military list;, 88 but the splendid 
commands of five and ten thousand horse may be rather expressive of 
the rank and pension of the chiefs than of the genuine number of ef- 
fective soldiers. 40 In the pillage of Syria the Moguls had acquired 
irmnen.se riches; but the delivery of their pay and arrears, for seven 
years more firmly attached them to the Imperial- standard. 

During this diversion of the Mogul arms:, Bajazet had two years, to 
collect his forces for a more serious encounter. They consisted of four 
hundred thousand horse and foot,* 1 whose merit and fidelity were of 
an unequal complexion. We may discriinmate the Janizaries, who have 
been? gradually ifcised to an establishment of forty thousand men; a 
national cavalry, the Spahfe. of modern times; twenty thousand cui- 
rassiers of Europe, dad in black and impenetrable armour; the troops 
of Anatolia^ whose princes had taken refuge in the camp of Timour; 
and a colony of Tartars, whom he had driven from Kipzak, and to 
whom Bajazet had assigned a settlement in the plains of Adrianople. 
The fearless confidence of the sultan urged him to meet his antagonist; 
and, as if he had choaea that spot for revenge,, he displayed his ban- 

88 The marches and occupations of Timour between the Syrian and Otto- 
man wars are represented by Sherefeddin (L v. c. 29-43) and Arabshah 
(torn, iu c. 15-18). 

"This number of 800,090 was extracted by Arabshah, or rather by Ebn 
Schounah, ex ratfonario Timuri, on the faith of a Carizmian officer (torn. i. 
c, 68, p.. 617) ; and it is remarkable enough that a Greek historian (Pnranza r 
L K c. 29) ^adds. no more than 20,900 men. Pogghis reckons 1,000,000; 
another tatin contemporary (Chronl Tarvisianum, apud Muratori, torn. 
xix. p. 800) 1,100,000;: and the enormous sum of 1,600,000- is attested by 
a German soldier who was present at the battle of Angora (Letmclav. ad 
Cbakocondyl. L iii. p. 82). 'Timotuv in his Institutions, has not deigned: to 
calculate ^ his troops, his subjects, or. his 1 revemaes.

ners near the ruins of the unfortunate Suvas. In the meanwhile, Ti~ 
mour moved from the Araxes through the countries of Armenia and 
Anatolia: his boldness was secured by the wisest precautions; his speed 
was guided by order and discipline; and the woods, the mountains, and 1 
the rivers were diligently explored by the flying squadrons who marked 
his road and preceded his standard. Firm in his plan of fighting in 
the heart of the Ottoman kingdom, he avoided their camp, dexterously 
inclined to the left, occupied Csesarea, traversed the salt desert and the 
river Halys, and invested Angora; while the sultan, immovable and 
ignorant in his post, compared the Tartar swiftness to the crawling of 
a snail; 42 he returned on the wings of indignation to the relief of An- 
gora; and as both generals were alike impatient for action, the plains- 
round that city were the scene of a memorable battle, which has im- 
mortalised the glory of Timour and the shame of Bajazet. For this 
signal victory the Mogul .emperor was indebted to himself, to the genius 
of the moment, and the discipline of thirty years. He had improved 
the tactics, without violating the manners, of his nation, 43 whose force- 
still consisted in the missile weapons and rapid evolutions of a numerous 
cavalry. From a single troop to a great army the mode of attack was 
the same: a foremost line first advanced to the charge, and was sup- 
ported in a just order by the squadrons of the great vanguard. The 
general's eye watched over the field, and at his command the front and 
rear of the right and left wings successively moved forwards in their 
several divisions, and in a direct or oblique line; the enemy was pressed 
by eighteen or twenty attacks, and each attack afforded a chance of 
victory. If they all proved fruitless or unsuccessful, the occasion was 
worthy of the emperor himself, who gave the signal of advancing to the 
standard and main body, which he led in person. 44 But in the battle of 
Angora the main body itself was supported, on the flanks and in the rear, 
by the bravest squadrons of the reserve, commanded by the sons and 
grandsons of Timour. The conqueror of Hindostan ostentatiously 
showed a line of elephants, the trophies rather than the instruments of 
victory: the use of the Greek fire was familiar to the Moguls and Otto* 
mans; but had they borrowed from Europe the recent invention of 
gunpowder and cannon, the artificial thunder, in the hands of either 
nation, must have turned the fortune of the day. 45 In that day Bajazet 

43 It may not be useless to mark the distances between Angora and the 
neighbouring cities by the journeys of the caravans, each of twenty or 
twenty-five miles; to Smyrna twenty, to Kiotahia ten, to Boursa ten, to 
Caesarea eight, to Sinope ten, to Nicomedia nine, to Constantinople twelve 
or thirteen (see Tournefort, Voyage au Levant, torn. ii. lettre xxi.).

displayed the qualities of a soldier and a chief; but his genius sunk 
under a stronger ascendant, and, from various motives, the greatest part 
of his troops failed him in the decisive moment. His rigour and avarice 
had provoked a mutiny among the Turks, and even his son Soliman too 
hastily withdrew from the field. The forces of Anatolia, loyal in their 
revolt, were drawn away to the banners of their lawful princes. His 
Tartar allies had been tempted by the letters and emissaries of Timour, 40 
who reproached their ignoble servitude under the slaves of their fathers, 
and offered to their hopes the dominion of their new or the liberty of 
their ancient country. In the right wing of Bajazet the cuirassiers of 
Europe charged, with faithful hearts and irresistible arms; but these 
men of iron were soon broken by an artful flight and headlong pursuit; 
and the Janizaries alone, without cavalry or missile weapons, were en- 
compassed by the circle of the Mogul hunters. Their valour was at 
length oppressed by heat, thirst, and the weight of numbers; and the 
unfortunate sultan, afflicted with the gout in his hands and feet, was 
transported from the field on the fleetest of his horses. He was pur- 
sued and taken by the titular khan of Zagatai; and, after his capture 
and the defeat of the Ottoman powers, the kingdom of Anatolia sub- 
mitted to the conqueror, who planted his standard at Kiotahia, and 
dispersed on all sides the ministers of rapine and destruction. Mirza 
Mehemmed Sultan, the eldest and best beloved of his grandsons, was 
despatched to Boursa with thirty thousand horse; and such was his 
youthful ardour, that he arrived with only four thousand at the gates 
of the capital, after performing in five days a march of two hundred and 
thirty miles. Yet fear is still more rapid in its course; and Soliman, the 
son of Bajazet, had already passed over to Europe with the royal treas- 
ure. The spoil, however, of the palace and city was immense: the in- 
habitants had escaped; but the buildings, for the most part of wood, 
were reduced to ashes. From Boursa the grandson of Timour advanced 
to Nice, even yet a fair and flourishing city; and the Mogul squadrons 
were only stopped by the waves of the Propontis. The same success 
attended the other mirzas and emirs in their excursions; and Smyrna, 
defended by the zeal and courage of the Rhodian knights, alone de- 
served the presence of the emperor himself. After an obstinate defence 
the place was taken by storm: all that breathed was put to the sword; 
and the heads of the Christian heroes were launched from the engines, on 
board of two carracks or great ships of Europe that rode at anchor in 
the harbour. The Moslems of Asia rejoiced in their deliverance from a 
dangerous and domestic foe; and a parallel was drawn between the two 
rivals by observing that Timour, in fourteen days, had reduced a

the universal silence of contemporaries. 

^Timour has dissembled this secret and important negotiation with the 
Tartars, which is indisputably proved by the joint evidence of the Arabian 
(torn. L c. 47, p. 391), Turkish (Annal. Leunclav. p. 321), and Persian 
historians (KhoHdemir apud D'Herbelot, p. 882).

fortress which had sustained seven years the siege, or at least the block- 
ade, of Bajazet. 47 

The iron cage in which Bajazet was imprisoned by Tamerlane, so 
long and so often repeated as a moral lesson, is now rejected as a fable 
by the modern writers, who smile at the vulgar credulity. 48 They appeal 
with confidence to the Persian history of Sherefeddin All, which has 
been given to our curiosity in a French version, and from which I shall 
collect and abridge a more specious narrative of this memorable transac- 
tion. No sooner was Timour informed that the captive Ottoman was 
at the door of his tent than he graciously stepped forward to receive 
him, seated him by his side, and mingled with just reproaches a soothing 
pity for his rank and misfortune. "Alas!" said the emperor, "the 
decree of fate is now accomplished by your own fault; it is the web 
which you have woven, the thorns of the tree which yourself have 
planted. I wished to spare, and even to assist, the champion of the 
Moslems: you braved our threats; you despised our friendship; you 
forced us to enter your kingdom with our invincible armies. Behold 
the event. Had you vanquished, I am not ignorant of the fate which 
you reserved for myself and my troops. But I disdain to retaliate: 
your life and honour are secure; and I shall express my gratitude to 
God by my clemency to man." The royal captive showed some signa 
of repentance, accepted the humiliation of a robe of honour, and em- 
braced with tears his son Mousa, who, at his request, was sought and 
found among the captives of the field. The Ottoman princes were lodged 
in a splendid pavilion, and the respect of the guards could be surpassed 
only by their vigilance. On the arrival of the harem from Boursa, 
Timour restored the queen Despina and her daughter to their father 
and husband; but he piously required that the Servian princess, who 
had hitherto been indulged in the profession of Christianity, should em- 
brace without delay the religion of the prophet. In the feast of vic- 
tory, 'to which Bajazet was invited, the Mogul emperor placed a crown . 
on his head and a sceptre in his hand, with a solemn assurance of 
restoring him with an increase of glory to the throne of his ancestors. 
But the effect of this promise was disappointed by the sultan's untimely 
death; amidst the care of the most skilful physicians he expired of an 
apoplexy at Akshehr, the Antioch of Pisidia, about nine months after 
his defeat. The victor dropped a tear over his grave: his body, with 
royal pomp, was conveyed to the mausoleum which he had erected at 
Boursa; and his son Mousa, after receiving a rich present of gold and

to the copious narratives of Sherefeddin (1. v. c. 44-65) and Arabshah (torn. 
ii. c. 20-35). On this part only of Timour*s history it is lawful to quote the 
Turks (Cantemir, p. 53-55; Annal. Leundav. p. 320-322) and the Greeks 
(Phranza, 1. i. c. 29; Ducas, c. 15-17; Chalcocondyles, 1. iii.). 

48 The scepticism of Voltaire (Essai sur 1'Histoire G&amp;ie'raJe, c. 88) is ready 
on this, as on every occasion, to reject a popular tale, and to diminish the 
magnitude of vice, and virtue: and on most occasions his incredulity is 
reasonable.

Such is the portrait of a generous conqueror, which has been extracted 
from his own memorials, and dedicated to his son and grandson, nine- 
teen years after his decease; 40 and, at a time when the truth was remem- 
bered by thousands, a manifest falsehood would have implied a satire 
on his real conduct. Weighty indeed is this evidence, adopted by all 
the Persian histories; 00 yet flattery, more especially in the East, is base 
and audacious; and the harsh and ignominious treatment of Bajazet is 
attested by a chain of witnesses, some of whom shall be produced in the 
order of their time and country, i. The reader has not forgot the gar- 
rison of French whom the marshal Boucicault left behind him for the 
defence of Constantinople. They were on the spot to receive the earliest 
and most faithful intelligence of the overthrow of their great adversary, 
and it is more than probable that some of them accompanied the Greek 
embassy to the camp of Tamerlane. From their account, the hardships 
of the prison and death of Bajazet are affirmed by the marshal's servant 
and historian, within the distance of seven years. 61 2. The name of 
Poggius the Italian 52 is deservedly famous among the revivers of learn- 
ing in the fifteenth century. His elegant dialogue on the vicissitudes 
of fortune 58 was composed in his fiftieth year, twenty-eight years after 
the Turkish victory of Tamerlane, 5 * whom he celebrates as not inferior 
to the illustrious barbarians of antiquity. Of his exploits and disci- 
pline Poggius was informed by several ocular witnesses: nor does he 
forget an example so apposite to his theme as the Ottoman monarch, 
whom the Scythian confined like a wild beast in an iron cage, and ex- 

*See the History of Sherefeddin (L v. c. 49, 52, 53, 59, 60). This work 
was finished at Shiraz, in the year 1424, and dedicated to sultan Ibrahim, 
the son of Sharokh, the son of Timour, who reigned in Farsistan in his 
father's lifetime. 

"After the perusal of Khondemir, Ebn Schounah, etc., the learned D'Herbe- 
lot (Biblioth. Orientale, p. 882) may affirm that this fable is not mentioned 
in the most authentic histories; but his denial of the visible testimony 
of Arabshah leaves some room to suspect his accuracy.

-was expelled, in the year 1409, by a popular insurrection (Muratori, Annali

08 The reader will find a satisfactory account of the life and writings of 
Poggius in the Poggiana, an entertaining work of M. Lenfant, and in the 
Bibliotheca Latina mediae et infimae JEtatis of Fabricius (torn. v. p. 305-308). 
Poggius was born in the year 1380, and died in 1459. 

08 The dialogue de Varietate Fortunae (of which a complete and elegant 
edition has been published at Paris in 1723, in 4to) was composed a short 
time before the death of pope Martin V. (p. 5), and consequently about the 
end of the year 1430,

hibited a spectacle to Asia. I might add the authority of two Italian 
chronicles, perhaps of an earlier date, which would prove at least that 
the same story, whether false or true, was imported into Europe with 
the first tidings of the revolution. 55 3. At the time when Poggius flour- 
ished at Rome, Ahmed Ebn Arabshah composed at Damascus the florid 
and malevolent history of Timour, for which he had collected materials 
in his journeys over Turkey and Tartary. 00 Without any possible cor- 
respondence between the Latin and the Arabian writer, they agree in 
the fact of the iron cage; and their agreement is a striking proof of 
their common veracity. Ahmed Arabshah likewise relates another out- 
rage which Bajazet endured, of a more domestic and tender nature. 
His indiscreet mention of women and divorces was deeply resented by 
the jealous Tartar: in the feast of victory the wine was served by 
female cupbearers, and the sultan beheld his own concubines and wives 
confounded among the slaves, and exposed without a veil to the eyes of 
intemperance. To escape a similar indignity, it is said that his sue- 
cessors, except in a single instance, have abstained from legitimate nup 
tials; and the Ottoman practice and belief, at least in the sixteenth 
century, is attested by the observing Busbequius, 57 ambassador from 
the court of Vienna to the great Soliman. 4. Such is the separation of 
language, that the testimony of a Greek is not less independent than 
that of a Latin or an Arab. I suppress the names of Chalcocondyles 
and Ducas, who flourished in a later period, and who speak in a less 
positive tone; but more attention is due to George Phranza, 58 proto- 
vestiare of the last emperors, and who was born a year before the battle 
of Angora. Twenty-two years after that event he was sent ambassador 
to Amurath the Second; and the historian might converse with some 
veteran Janizaries, who had been made prisoners with the sultan, and 
had themselves seen him in his iron cage. 5. The last evidence, in every 
sense, is that of the Turkish annals, which have been consulted or tran- 
scribed by Leunclavius, Pocock, and Cantemir. 50 They unanimously 
deplore the captivity of the iron cage; and some credit may be allowed 

86 The Chronicon Tarvisianum (in Muratori, Script. Rerum Italicarum, 
torn. xix. p. 800), and the Annales Estenses (torn, xviii. p. 974). The two 
authors, Andrea de Redusiis de Quero, and James de Delayto, were both 
contemporaries, and both chancellors, the one of Trevigi, the other of 
Ferrara. The evidence of the former is the most positive.

to national historians, who cannot stigmatise the Tartar without uncov- 
ering the shame of their king and country. 

From these opposite premises a fair and moderate conclusion may be 
deduced. I am satisfied that Sherefeddin Ali has faithfully described 
the first ostentatious interview, in which the conqueror, whose spirits 
were harmonised by success, affected the character of generosity. But 
his mind was insensibly alienated by the unseasonable arrogance of 
Bajazet; the complaints of his enemies, the Anatolian princes, were 
just and vehement; and Timour betrayed a design of leading his royal 
captive in triumph to Samarcand. An attempt to facilitate his esape, 
by digging a mine under the tent, provoked the Mogul emperor to 
impose a harsher restraint; and in his perpetual marches an iron cage 
on a waggon might be invented, not as a wanton insult, but as a rigor- 
ous precaution. Timour had read in some fabulous history a similar 
treatment of one of his predecessors, a king of Persia; and Bajazet was 
condemned to represent the person and expiate the guilt of the Roman 
Caesar. 60 But the strength of his mind and body fainted under the trial, 
and his premature death might, without injustice, be ascribed to the 
severity of Timour. He warred not with the dead: a tear and a sepul- 
chre were all that he could bestow on a captive who was delivered from 
his power; and if Mousa, the son of Bajazet, was permitted to reign 
over the ruins of Boursa, the greatest part of the province of Anatolia 
had been restored by the conqueror to their lawful sovereigns. 

From the Irtish and Volga to the Persian Gulf, and from the Ganges 
to Damascus and the Archipelago, Asia was in the hand of Timour: his 
armies were invincible, his ambition was boundless, and his zeal might 
aspire to conquer and convert the Christian kingdoms of the West, which 
already trembled at his name. He touched the utmost verge of the 
land; but an insuperable, though narrow sea, rolled between the two 
continents of Europe and Asia, 61 and the lord of so many tomans or 
myriads of horse was not master of a single galley. The two passages 
of the Bosphorus and Hellespont, of Constantinople and Gallipoli, were 
possessed, the one by the Christians, the other by the Turks. On this 
great occasion they forgot the difference of religion, to act with union 
and firmness in the common cause: the double straits were guarded 
with ships and fortifications, and they separately withheld the trans- 
ports which Timour demanded of either nation, under the pretence of 

60 A Sapor, king of Persia, had been made prisoner, and enclosed in the 
figure of a cow's hide, by Maximian or Galerius Caesar. Such is the fable 
related by Eutychius (Annal. torn. i. p. 421, vers. Pocock). The recollec- 
tion of the true history (Decline and Fall, etc., vol. i. p. 320-322) will teach 
us to appreciate the knowledge of the Orientals of the ages which precede 
the Hegira. 

3 *Arabshah (torn. ii. c. 25) describes, like a curious traveller, the straits 
of Gallipoli and Constantinople. To acquire a just idea of these events 
I have compared the narratives and prejudices of the Moguls, Turks, 
Greeks, and Arabians. The Spanish ambassador mentions this hostile union 
of the Christians and Ottomans (Vie de Timour, p. 96). 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE "&gt;73 

attacking their enemy. At the same time they soothed his pride with 
tributary gifts and suppliant embassies, and prudently tempted him to 
retreat with the honours of victory. Soliman, the son of Bajazet, im- 
plored his clemency for his father and himself; accepted, by a red 
patent, the investiture of the kingdom of Romania, which he already 
held by the sword, and reiterated his ardent wish of casting himself in 
person at the feet of the king of the world. The Greek emperor 2 
(either John or Manuel) submitted to pay the same tribute which he 
had stipulated with the Turkish sultan, and ratified the treaty by an 
oath of allegiance, from which he could absolve his conscience so soon 
as the Mogul arms had retired from Anatolia. But the fears and fancy 
of nations ascribed to the ambitious Tamerlane a new design of vast 
and romantic compass; a design of subduing Egypt and Africa, march- 
ing from the Nile to the Atlantic Ocean, entering Europe by the Straits 
of Gibraltar, and, after imposing his yoke on the kingdoms of Christen- 
dom, of returning home by the deserts of Russia and Tartary. This 
remote, and perhaps imaginary danger, was averted by the submission 
of the sultan of Egypt: the honours of the prayer and the coin attested 
at Cairo the supremacy of Timour ; and a rare gift of a giraffe or camelo- 
pard, and nine ostriches, represented at Samarcand the tribute of the 
African world. Our imagination is not less astonished by the portrait 
of a Mogul, who, in his camp before Smyrna, meditates and almost 
accomplishes the invasion of the Chinese empire. 03 Timour was urged 
to this enterprise by national honour and religious zeal. The torrents 
which he had shed of Musulman blood could be expiated only by an 
equal destruction of the infidels; and as he now stood at the gates of 
paradise, he might best secure his glorious entrance by demolishing the 
idols of China, founding mosques in every city, and establishing the pro* 
fession of faith in one God and his prophet Mohammed. The recent 
expulsion of the house of Zingis was an insult on the Mogul name, and 
the disorders of the empire afforded the fairest opportunity for revenge. 
The illustrious Hongvou, founder of the dynasty of M ing, died four 
years before the battle of Angora, and his grandson, a weak and unfor- 
tunate youth, was burnt in his palace, after a million of Chinese had 
perished in the civil war. 6 * Before he evacuated Anatolia, Timou* 
despatched beyond the Sihoon a numerous army, or rather colony, of 
his old and new subjects, to open the road, to subdue the pagan Cal- 

" Since the name of Caesar had been transferred to the sultans of Roum, 
the Greek princes of Constantinople (Sherefeddin, 1. v. c. 54) were con-

title of Tekkur, which is derived by corruption from the genitive TOV icvplov 
(Cantemir, p. 51).

mucks and Mungals, and to found cities and magazines in the desert; 
and, by the diligence of his lieutenant, he soon received a perfect map 
and description of the unknown regions, from the source of the Irtish 
to the wall of China. During these preparations the emperor achieved 
the final conquest of Georgia, passed the winter on the banks of the 
Araxes, appeased the troubles of Persia, and slowly returned to his cap- 
ital after a campaign of four yeaxs and nine months. 

On the throne of Samarcand 6B he displayed, in a short repose, his 
magnificence and power; listened to the complaints of the people; dis- 
tributed a just measure of rewards and punishments; employed his 
riches in the architecture of palaces and temples; and gave audience to 
the ambassadors of Egypt, Arabia, India, Tartary, Russia, and Spain, 
the last of whom presented a suit of tapestry which eclipsed the pencil 
of the Oriental artists. The marriage of six of the emperor's grandsons 
was esteemed an act of religion as well as of paternal tenderness; and 
-the pomp of the ancient caliphs was revived in their nuptials. They 
were celebrated in the gardens of Canighul, decorated with innumerable 
tents and pavilions, which displayed the luxury of a great city and the 
spoils of a victorious camp. Whole forests were cut down to supply 
fuel for the kitchens; the plain was spread with pyramids of meat and 
vases of every liquor, to which thousands of guests were courteously 
invited: the orders of the state and the nations of the earth were mar- 
shalled at the royal banquet; nor were the ambassadors of Europe (says 
the haughty Persian) excluded from the feast; since even the casses, 
the smallest of fish, find their place in the ocean. 00 The public joy 
was testified by illuminations and masquerades; the trades of Samar- 
cand passed in review; and every trade was emulous to execute some 
quaint device, some marvellous pageant, with the materials of their 
peculiar art. After the marriage-contracts had been ratified by the 
cadhis, the bridegrooms and their brides retired to the nuptial cham- 
bers: nine times, according to the Asiatic fashion, they were dressed and 
undressed; and at each change of apparel pearls and rubies were show- 
ered on their heads, and contemptuously abandoned to their attendants. 
A general indulgence was proclaimed: every law was relaxed, every 
pleasure was allowed; the people was free, the sovereign was idle; and 
the historian of Timour may remark, that, after devoting fifty years to 
the attainment of empire, the only happy period of his life were the two 
months in which he ceased to exercise his power. But he was soon 
awakened to the cares of government and war. The standard was un-

60 Sherefeddin (1. vi. c. 24) mentions the ambassadors of one of the most 
potent sovereigns 'of Europe. We know that it was Henry III. king of 
Castile; and the curious relation of his two embassies is still extant (Mariana, 
Hist. Hispan. 1. xix. c. n, torn. ii. p. 329, 330; Avertissement 1'Hist. de 
Timur Bee, p. 28-33). There appears likewise, to have been some corre- 
spondence between the Mogul emperor and the court of Charles VII. king 
of France (Histoire de France, par Velly et Villaret t*m. xii. p. 336). 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 675 

furled for the invasion of China: the emirs made their report of two 
hundred thousand, the select and veteran soldiers of Iran and Touran: 
their baggage and provisions were transported by five hundred great 
waggons and an immense train of horses and camels; and the troops 
might prepare for a long absence, since more than six months were em- 
ployed in the tranquil journey of a caravan from Samarcand to Pekin. 
Neither age nor the severity of the winter could retard the impatience 
of Timour; he mounted on horseback, passed the Sihoon on the ice, 
marched seventy-six parasangs, three hundred miles, from his capital^ 
and pitched his last camp in the neighbourhood of Otrar, where he was 
expected by the angel of death. Fatigue, and the indiscreet use of iced 
water, accelerated the progress of his fever; and the conqueror of Asia 
expired in the seventieth year of his age, thirty-five years after he had 
ascended the throne of Zagatai. His designs were lost; his armies were 
disbanded; China was saved; and fourteen years after his decease, the 
most powerful of his children sent an embassy of friendship and com- 
merce to the court of Pekin. 67 

The fame of Timour has pervaded the East and West: his posterity 
is still invested with the Imperial title] and the admiration of his sub- 
jects, who revered him almost as a deity, may be justified in some de&gt; 
gree by the praise or confession of his bitterest enemies. 68 Although 
he was lame of a hand and foot, his form and stature were not unworthy 
of his rank; and his vigorous health, so essential to himself and to the 
world, was corroborated by temperance and exercise. In his familiar 
discourse he was grave and modest; and if he was ignorant of the 
Arabic language, he spoke with fluency and elegance the Persian and 
Turkish idioms. It was his delight to converse with the learned on 
topics of history and science; and the amusement of his leisure hours 
was the game of chess, which he improved or corrupted with new re- 
finements. 09 In his religion he was a zealous, though not perhaps an 
orthodox, Musulman; 70 but his sound understanding may tempt us to 
believe that a superstitious reverence for omens and prophecies, for 
saints and astrologers, was only affected as an instrument of policy. In 

07 See the translation of the Persian account of their embassy, a curious 
and original piece (in the fourth part of the Relations de Thevenot). They 
presented the emperor of China with an old horse which Timour had 
formerly rode. It was in the year 1419 that they departed from the court 
of .Herat, to which place they returned in 1422 from Pekin.

reproves the impiety of Timour and the Moguls, who almost preferred to 
the Koran the Yacsa, or Law of Zingis (cui Deus maledicat) ; nor will he 
believe that Sharokh had abolished the use and authority of that pagan code. 



676 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

the government of a vast empire he stood alone and absolute, without 
a rebel to oppose his power, a favourite to seduce his affections, or a 
minister to mislead his judgment. It was his firmest maxim, that, what- 
ever might be the consequence, the word of the prince should never be 
disputed or recalled; but his foes have maliciously observed that the 
commands of anger and destruction were more strictly executed than 
those of beneficence and favour. His sons and grandsons, of whom 
Timour left six-and-thirty at his decease, were his first and most sub- 
missive subjects; and whenever they deviated from their duty, they 
were corrected, according to the laws of Zingis, with the bastonade, 
and afterwards restored to honour and command. Perhaps his heart 
was not devoid of the social virtues; perhaps he was not incapable of 
loving his friends and pardoning his enemies; but the rules of morality 
are founded on the public interest; and it may be sufficient to applaud 
the -wisdom of a monarch, for the liberality by which he is not impov- 
erished, and for the justice by which he is strengthened and enriched. 
To maintain the harmony of authority and obedience, to chastise the 
proud, to protect the weak, to reward the deserving, to banish vice and 
idleness from his dominions, to secure the traveller and merchant, to 
restrain the depredations of the soldier, to cherish the labours of the 
husbandman, to encourage industry and learning, and, by an equal 
and moderate assessment, to increase the revenue without increasing 
the taxes, are indeed the duties of a prince; but, in the discharge of 
these duties, he finds an ample and immediate recompense. Timour 
might boast that, at his accession to the throne, Asia was the prey to 
anarchy and rapine, whilst under his prosperous monarchy a child, fear- 
less and unhurt, might carry a purse of gold from the East to the West, 
Such was his confidence of merit, that from this reformation he derived 
an excuse for his victories and a title to universal dominion. The four 
following observations will serve to appreciate his claim to the public 
gratitude; and perhaps we shall conclude that the Mogul emperor was 
rather the scourge than the benefactor of mankind, i. If some partial 
disorders, some local oppressions, were healed by the sword of Timour, 
the remedy was far more pernicious than the disease. By their rapine, 
cruelty, and discord, the petty tyrants of Persia might afflict their sub- 
jects; but whole nations were crushed under the footsteps of the re- 
former. The ground which had been occupied by flourishing cities was 
often marked by his abominable trophies, by columns, or pyramids, of 
human heads. Astracan, Carizme, Delhi, Ispahan, Bagdad, Aleppo, 
Damascus, Boursa, Smyrna, and a thousand others, were sacked, or 
burnt, or utterly destroyed, in his presence and by his troops: and 
perhaps his conscience would have been startled if a priest or philoso- 
pher had dared to number the millions of victims whom he had sacri- 
ficed to the establishment of peace and order. 71 2. His most destruc-

live wars were rather inroads than conquests. He invaded Turkestan, 
Kipzak, Russia, Hindostan, Syria, Anatolia, Armenia, and Georgia, with- 
out a hope or a desire of preserving those distant provinces. From 
thence he departed laden with spoil; but he left behind him neither 
troops to awe the contumacious, nor magistrates to protect the obedi- 
ent, natives. When he had broken the fabric of their ancient govern- 
ment he abandoned them to the evils which his invasion had aggra- 
vated or caused; nor were these evils compensated by any present or 
possible benefits. 3. The kingdoms of Transoxiana and Persia were 
the proper field which he laboured to cultivate and adorn as the per- 
petual inheritance of his family. But his peaceful labours were often 
interrupted, and sometimes blasted, by the absence of the conqueror. 
While he triumphed on the Volga or the Ganges, his servants, and even 
his sons, forgot their master and their duty. The public and private 
injuries were poorly redressed by the tardy rigour of inquiry and pun- 
ishment; and we must be content to praise the Institutions of Timour 
as the specious idea of a perfect monarchy. 4. Whatsoever might be 
the blessings of his administration, they evaporated with his life. To 
reign, rather than to govern, was the ambition of his children and grand- 
children, 72 the enemies of each other and of the people. A fragment 
of the empire was upheld with some glory by Sharokh, his youngest 
son; but after his decease the scene was again involved in darkness and 
blood; and before the end of a century Transoxiana and Persia were 
trampled by the Uzbeks from the north, and the Turkmans of the black 
and white sheep. The race of Timour would have been extinct if a 
hero, his descendant in the fifth degree, had not fled before the Uzbek 
arms to the conquest of Hindostan. His successors (the great Mo- 
guls 73 ) extended their sway from the mountains of Cashmir to 
Cape Comorin, and from Candahar to the gulf of Bengal. Since the 
reign of Aurungzebe their empire has been dissolved; their treasures of 
Delhi have been rifled by a Persian robber; and the richest of their 
kingdoms is now possessed by a company of Christian merchants of 4 
remote island in the Northern Ocean. 

Far different was the fate of the Ottoman monarchy. The massy 
trunk was bent to the ground, but no sooner did the hurricane pass 
away than it again rose with fresh vigour and more lively vegetation. 
When Timour in every sense had evacuated Anatolia, he left the cities 

of his cruelty. Except in Rowe's play on the fifth of November, I did not 
expect to hear of Timour's amiable moderation (White's preface, p. 7). 
Yet I can excuse a generous enthusiasm in the reader, and still more in the 
editor, of the Institutions. 

Consult the last chapters of Sherefeddin and Arabshah, and M. de 
Guignes (Hist, des Huns, torn. iv. 1. xx.). Eraser's History of Nadir Shah 
(p. 1-62). The story of Timour's descendants is imperfectly told; and 
the second and third parts of Sherefeddin are unknown.

without a palace, a treasure, or a king. The open country was over- 
spread with hordes of shepherds and robbers of Tartar or Turkman 
origin; the recent conquests of Bajazet were restored to the emirs, one 
of whom, in base revenge, demolished his sepulchre; and his five sons 
were eager, by civil discord, to consume the remnant of their patrimony. 
I shall enumerate their names in the order of their age and actions. 74 
i. It is doubtful whether I relate the story of the true Mustapha, or of 
an impostor who personated that lost prince. He fought by his father's 
side in the battle of Angora: but when the captive sultan was permitted 
to inquire for his children, Mousa alone could be found; and the Turk- 
ish historians, the slaves of the triumphant faction, are persuaded that 
his brother was confounded among the slain. If Mustapha escaped from 
that disastrous field, he was concealed twelve years from his friends and 
enemies, till he emerged in Thessaly, and was hailed by a numerous 
party as the son and successor of Bajazet. His first defeat would have 
been his last, had not the true or false Mustapha been saved by the 
Greeks, and restored, after the decease of his brother Mohammed, to 
liberty and empire. A degenerate mind seemed to argue his spurious 
birth; and if, on the throne of Adrianople, he was adored as the Otto- 
man sultan, his flight, his fetters, and an ignominious gibbet delivered 
the impostor to popular contempt. A similar character and claim was 
asserted by several rival pretenders: thirty persons are said to have 
suffered under the name of Mustapha; and these frequent executions 
may perhaps insinuate that the Turkish court was. not perfectly secure 
of the death of the lawful prince. 2. After his father's captivity Isa T5 
reigned for some time in the neighbourhood of Angora, Sinope, and the 
Black Sea; and his ambassadors were dismissed from the presence of 
Timour with fair promises and honourable gifts. But their master was 
soon deprived of his province and life by a jealous brother, the sovereign 
of Amasia; and the final event suggested a pious allusion that the law 
of Moses and Jesus, of Isa and Mousa, had been abrogated by the 
greater Mohammed. 3. S oilman is not numbered in the list of the Turk- 
ish emperors: yet he checked the victorious progress of the Moguls, and, 
after their departure, uijited for a while the thrones of Adrianople and 
Boursa. In war he was brave, active, and fortunate: his courage was 
softened by clemency; but it was likewise inflamed by presumption, 
and corrupted by intemperance and idleness. He relaxed the nerves of 
discipline in a government where either the subject or the sovereign must 
continually tremble: his vices alienated the chiefs of the army and the 
law; and his daily drunkenness, so contemptible in a prince and a man, 

"The civil wars, from the death of Bajazet to that of Mustapha, are 
related, according to the Turks, by Demetrius Cantemir (p. 58-82). Of 
the Greeks, Chalcocondyles (1. iv. and v.), Phranza (1. i. c. 30-32), and 
Ducas (c. 18-27), the last is the most copious and best informed.

was doubly odious in a disciple of the prophet. In the slumber of in- 
toxication he was surprised by his brother Mousa; and as he fled from 
Adrianople towards the Byzantine capital, Soliman was overtaken and 
slain in a bath, after a reign of seven years and ten menths. 4. The 
investiture of Mousa degraded him as the slave of the Moguls: his tribu- 
tary kingdom of Anatolia was confined within a narrow limit, nor could 
his broken militia and empty treasury contend with the hardy and vet- 
eran bands of the sovereign of Romania. Mousa fled in disguise from 
the palace of Boursa; traversed the Propontis in an open boat; wan- 
dered over the Wallachian and Servian hills; and after some vain 
attempts, ascended the throne of Adrianople, so recently stained with 
the blood of Soliman. In a reign of three years and a half his troops 
were victorious against the Christians of Hungary and the Morea; but 
Mousa was ruined by his timorous disposition and unseasonable clem- 
ency. After resigning the sovereignty of Anatolia he fell a victim to the 
perfidy of his ministers and the superior ascendant of his brother Mo- 
hammed. 5. The final victory of Mohammed was the just recompense 
of his prudence and moderation. Before his father's captivity the royal 
youth had been intrusted with the government of Ariiasia, thirty days 7 
journey from Constantinople, and the Turkish frontier against the 
Christians of Trebizond and Georgia. The castle in Asiatic warfare 
was esteemed impregnable; and the city of Amasia, 70 which is equally 
divided by the river Iris, rises on either side in the form of an amphi- 
theatre, and represents on a smaller scale the image of Bagdad. In his 
rapid career Timour appears to have overlooked this obscure and con- 
tumacious angle of Anatolia; and Mohammed, without provoking the 
conqueror, maintained his silent independence, and chased from the 
province the last stragglers of the Tartar host. He relieved himself 
from the dangerous neighbourhood of Isa; but in the contests of their 
more powerful brethren his firm neutrality was respected, till, after the 
triumph of Mousa, he stood forth the heir and avenger of the unfor- 
tunate Soliman. Mohammed obtained Anatolia by treaty and Romania 
by arms; and the soldier who presented him with the head of Mousa 
was rewarded as the benefactor of his king and country. The eight 
years of his sole and peaceful reign were usefully employed in banish- 
ing the vices of civil discord, and restoring on a firmer basis the fabric 
of the Ottoman monarchy. His last care was the choice of two vizirs, 
Bajazet and Ibrahim, 77 who might guide the youth of his son Amurath; 
and such was their union and prudence, that they concealed above forty 
days the emperor's death till the arrival of his successor in the palace of 
Boursa. A new war was kindled in Europe by the prince, or impostor,

"The virtues of Ibrahim are praised by a contemporary Greek (Ducas, 
c. 25). His descendants are the sole nobles in Turkey: they content them- 
selves with the administration of his pious foundations, are excused from 
public offices, and receive two annual visits from the sultan (Cantemir, p. 76). 



68o THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

Mustapha; the first vizir lost his army and his head; but the more for- 
tunate Ibrahim, whose name and family are still revered, extinguished 
the last pretender to the throne of Bajazet, and closed the scene of do- 
mestic hostility. 

In these conflicts the wisest Turks, and indeed the body of the nation, 
were strongly attached to the unity of the empire; and Romania and 
Anatolia, so often torn asunder by private ambition, were animated by 
a strong and invincible tendency of cohesion. Their efforts might have 
instructed the Christian powers; and had they occupied, with a confed- 
erate fleet, the straits of Gallipoli, the Ottomans, at least in Europe, must 
have been speedily annihilated. But the schism of the West, and the 
factions and wars of France and England, diverted the Latins from this 
generous enterprise: they enjoyed the present respite, without a thought 
of futurity; and were often tempted by a momentary interest to serve 
the common enemy of their religion. A colony of Genoese, 78 which had 
been planted at Phocsea T9 on the Ionian coast, was enriched by the 
lucrative monopoly of alum; 80 and their tranquillity, under the Turkish 
empire, was secured by the annual payment of tribute. In the last 
civil war of the Ottomans, the Genoese governor, Adorno, a bold and 
ambitious youth, embraced the party of Amurath; and undertook, with 
seven stout galleys, to transport him from Asia to Europe. The sultan 
and five hundred guards embarked on board the admiral's ship; which 
was manned by eight hundred of the bravest Franks.. His life and 
liberty were in their hands; nor can we, without reluctance, applaud 
the fidelity of Adorno, who, in the midst of the passage, knelt before 
him, and gratefully accepted a discharge of his arrears of tribute. They 
landed in sight of Mustapha and Gallipoli; two thousand Italians, armed 
with lances and battle-axes, attended Amurath to the conquest of 
Adrianople; and this venal service was soon repaid by the ruin of the 
commerce and colony of Phocaea. 

If Timour had generously marched at the request, and to the relief, of 
the Greek emperor, he might be entitled to the praise and gratitude of 

18 See Pachymer (1. v. c. 29 [c. 30, torn. i. p. 420, ed. Bonn]), Nicephorus 
Gregoras (1. ii. c. i [xv. 7? vol. ii. p. 766, ed. Bonn]), Sherefeddin (L v. 
c. 57), and Ducas (c. 25). The last of these, a curious and careful observer, 
is entitled, from his birth and station, to particular credit in all that concerns 
Ionia and the islands. Among the nations that resorted to New Phocaea, 
he mentions the English ('177X^01 [p. 161, ed. Bonn]); an early evidence 
of Mediterranean trade. 

70 For the spirit of navigation and freedom of ancient Phocaea, or rather 
of the Phocseans, consult the first book of Herodotus, and the Geographical 
Index of his last and learned French translator, M. Larcher (torn. vii. 
p. 299). 

80 Phocaea is not enumerated by Pliny (Hist. Nat. xxxv. 52) among the 
places productive of alum: he reckons Egypt as the first, and for the 
second the isle of Melos, whose alum-mines are described by Tournefort 
(torn. i. lettre iv.), a traveller and a naturalist. After the loss of Phocaea, 
the Genoese, in 1459, found that useful mineral in the isle of Ischia (Ismael. 
Bouillaud, ad Ducam, c. 25).

the Christians. 81 But a Musulman who carried into Georgia the sword 
of persecution, and respected the holy warfare of Bajazet, was not dis- 
posed to pity or succour the idolaters of Europe. The Tartar follower 
the impulse of ambition; and the deliverance of Constantinople was the 
accidental consequence. When Manuel abdicated the government, it 
was his prayer, rather than his hope, that the ruin of the church and 
state might be delayed beyond his unhappy days; and after his return 
from a western pilgrimage, he expected every hour the news of a sad 
catastrophe. On a sudden he was astonished and rejoiced by the in- 
telligence of the retreat, the overthrow, and the captivity of the Otto- 
man. Manuel 82 immediately sailed from Modon in the Morea; as- 
cended the throne of Constantinople, and dismissed his blind competitor 
to an easy exile in the isle of Lesbos. The ambassadors of the son 
of Bajazet were soon introduced to his presence; but their pride was 
fallen, their tone was modest: they were awed by the just apprehension 
lest the Greeks should open to the Moguls the gates of Europe. Soli- 
man saluted the emperor by the name of father; solicited at his hands 
the government or gift of Romania; and promised to deserve his favour 
by inviolable friendship, and the restitution of Thessalonica, with the 
most important places along the Strymon, the Propontis, and the Black 
Sea. The alliance of Soliman exposed the emperor to the enmity and 
revenge of Mousa: the Turks appeared in arms before the gates of 
Constantinople; but they were repulsed by sea and land; and unless 
the city was guarded by some foreign mercenaries, the Greeks must 
have wondered at their own triumph. But, instead of prolonging the 
division of the Ottoman powers, the policy or passion of Manuel was 
tempted to assist the most formidable of the sons of Bajazet. He con- 
cluded a treaty with Mohammed, whose progress was checked by the 
insuperable barrier of Gallipoli: the sultan and his troops were trans- 
ported over the Bosphorus; he was hospitably entertained in the capi- 
tal; and his successful sally was the first step to the conquest of Ro- 
mania. The ruin was suspended by the prudence and moderation of the 
conqueror: he faithfully discharged his own obligations and those of 
Soliman; respected the laws of gratitude and peace; and left the em- 
peror guardian of his two younger sons, in the vain hope of saving them 
from the jealous cruelty of their brother Amurath. But the execution 
of his last testament would have offended the national honour and re- 
ligion; and the divan unanimously pronounced that the royal youths 

"The writer who has the most abused this fabulous generosity is our 
ingenious Sir William Temple (his Works, vol. in. p. 349, 350, octavo 
edition), that lover of exotic virtue. After the conquest of Russia, etc., 
and the passage of the Danube, his Tartar hero relieves, visits, admires, 
and refuses the city of Constantine. His flattering pencil deviates in every 
line from the truth of history; yet his pleasing fictions are more excusable 
than the gross errors of Cantemir.

should never be' abandoned to the custody and education of a Christian 
dog. On this refusal the Byzantine councils were divided: but the age 
and caution of Manuel yielded to the presumption of his son John; and 
they unsheathed a dangerous weapon of revenge, by dismissing the true 
or false Mustapha, who had long been detained as a captive and hos- 
tage, and for whose maintenance they received an annual pension of 
three hundred thousand aspers. 83 At the door of his prison, Mustapha 
subscribed to every proposal; and the keys of Gallipoli, or rather of 
Europe, were stipulated as the price of his deliverance. But no sooner 
was he seated on the throne of Romania than he dismissed the Greek 
ambassadors with a smile of contempt, declaring, in a pious tone, that, 
at the day of judgment, he would rather answer for the violation of an 
Oath, than for the surrender of a Musulman city into the hands of the 
infidels. The emperor was at once the enemy of the two rivals, from 
whom he had sustained, and to whom he had offered - 9 an injury; and the 
victory of Amurath was followed, in the ensuing spring, by the siege of 
Constantinople. 8 * 

The religious merit of subduing the city of the Caesars attracted from 
Asia a crowd 1 of volunteers, who aspired to the crown of martyrdom; 
their military ardour was inflamed by the promise of rich spoils and 
beautiful femafes; and the sultan's ambition was consecrated by the 
presence and prediction of Seid Bechar, a descendant of the prophet, 85 
who arrived in the camp, on a mule, with a venerable tram of five hun- 
dred disciples. But he might blush, if a fanatic could blush, at the 
failure of his assurances. The strength of the walls resisted an army 
of two hundred thousand Turks: their assaults were repelled by the 
sallies of the Greeks and their foreign mercenaries; the old resources 
of defence were opposed to the new engines of attack; and the enthusi- 
asm of the dervish, who was snatched to heaven in visionary converse 
with Mohammed, was answered by the credulity of the Christians, whd 
beheld the Virgin Mary, m a violet garment, walking 6n the rampart 
and animating their courage. 86 After a siege of two months Amurath 
was recalled to Boursa by a domestic revolt, which had been kindled 
by Greek treachery, and was soon extinguished by the death of a guilt- 
less brother. While he led his Janizaries to new conquests ia Europe

2500 sterling ^(Leunclav. Pandect. Turc, p. 406-408).

him, supposes that the friend of Mohammed assumed in his amours the 
privilege of a prophet, and that the fairest of the Greek mins were promised

M For this miraculous apparition Cananus appeals to the Masulman saint; 
but who will bear 'testimony for Seid -Bechar? 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 683 

and Asia, the Byzantine empire was indulged in a servile and precari- 
ous respite of thirty years. Manuel sank into the grave; and John 
Palssologus was permitted to reign, for an annual tribute of three hun- 
dred thousand aspers, and the dereliction of almost all that he held 
beyond the suburbs of Constantinople. 

In the establishment and restoration of the Turkish empire the 
first merit must doubtless be assigned to the personal qualities of the 
sultans; since, in human life, the most important scenes will depend 
on the character of a single actor. By some shades of wisdom and vir- 
tue they may be discriminated from each other; but, except in a single 
instance, a period of nine reigns, and two hundred and sixty-five years, 
is occupied, from the elevation of Othman to the death of Soliman, by 
a rare series of warlike and active princes, who impressed their sub- 
jects with obedience and their enemies with terror. Instead of the 
slothful luxury of the seraglio, the heirs of royalty were educated in the 
council and the field: from early youth they were entrusted by their 
fathers with the command of provinces and armies; and this manly 
institution, which was often productive of civil war must have essen- 
tially contributed to the discipline and vigour, of the monarchy. The 
Ottomans cannot style themselves, like the Arabian caliphs, the de- 
scendants or successors of the apostle of God; and the kindred which 
they claim with the Tartar khans of the house of Zingis appears to be 
founded in flattery rather than in truth. 87 Their origin is obscure; but 
their sacred and indefeasible right, which no time can erase, and no vio- 
lence can fringe, was soon and unalterably implanted in the minds of 
their subjects. A weak or vicious sultan may be deposed and strangled; 
but his inheritance devolves to an infant or an idiot: nor has the most 
daring rebel presumed to ascend the throne of his lawful sovereign. 88 

While the transient dynasties of Asia have been continually subverted 
by a crafty vizir in the palace or a victorious general in the camp, the 
Ottoman succession, has been confirmed by the practice of five centuries, 
and is now incorporated with the vital principle of the Turkish nation. 

To the spirit and constitution of that nation a strong and singular 
influence may however be ascribed. The primitive subjects of Othman 
were the four hundred families of wandering Turkmans who had fol- 
lowed his ancestors from the Oxus to the Sangar; and the plains of 
Anatolia are still covered with the white and black tents of their rustic 
brethren. But this original drop was dissolved in the mass of volun- 

87 See Rycaut (1. i. c. 13) . The Turkish sultans assume the title of khan. 
Yet Abulghazi is ignorant of his Ottoman cousins. 

88 The third grand vizir of the name of Kiuperli, who was slain at the 
.battle of Salankanen in 1691 (Cantemir, p. 382), presumed to say that all 
the successors of Soliman had been fools or tyrants, and that it was time 
to abolish the race (Marsigli, State Militare, etc., p, 28). This political 
heretic was a good Whig, and justified against the French embassador the 
revolution of England (Mignot, Hist, des Ottomans, torn. iii. p. 434). 
His presumption condemns the singular exception of continuing offices in 
the same family.

tary and vanquished subjects, who, under the name of Turks, are united 
by the common ties of religion, language, and manners. In the cities 
from Erzeroum to Belgrade, that national appellation is common to all 
the Moslems, the first and most honourable inhabitants; but they have 
abandoned, at least in Romania, the villages and the cultivation of the 
land to the Christian peasants. In the vigorous age of the Ottoman 
government the Turks were themselves excluded from all eivil and mili- 
tary honours; and a servile class, an artificial people, was raised by the 
discipline of education to obey, to conquer, and to command. 89 From 
the time of Orchan and the first Amurath the sultans were persuaded 
that a government of the sword must be renewed in each generation 
with new soldiers; and that such soldiers must be sought, not in effemi- 
nate Asia, but among the hardy and warlike natives of Europe. The 
provinces of Thrace, Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, and Servia became 
the perpetual seminary of the Turkish army; and when the royal fifth 
of the captives was diminished by conquest, an inhuman tax of the 
fifth child, or of every fifth year, was rigorously levied on the Christian 
families. At the age of twelve or fourteen years the most robust youths 
were torn from their parents; their names were enrolled in a book; and 
from that moment they were clothed, taught, and maintained for the 
public service. According to the promise of their appearance, they were 
selected for the royal schools of Boursa, Pera, and Adrianople, intrusted 
to the care of the bashaws, or dispersed in the houses of lie Anatolian 
peasantry. It was the first care of their masters to instruct them in the 
Turkish language: their bodies were exercised by every labour that 
could fortify their strength; they learned to wrestle, to leap, to run, to 
shoot with the bow, and afterwards with the musket; till they were 
drafted into the chambers and companies of the Janizaries, and severely 
trained in the military or monastic discipline of the order. The youths 
most conspicuous for birth, talents, and beauty, were admitted into the 
inferior class of Agiamoglans, or the more liberal rank of Ichoglans, of 
whom the former were attached to the palace, and the latter to the 
person of the prince. In four successive schools, under the rod of the 
white eunuchs, the arts of horsemanship and of darting the javelin 
were their daily exercise, while those of a more studious cast applied 
themselves to the study of the Koran, and the knowledge of the Arabic 
and Persian tongues. As they advanced in seniority and merit, they 
were gradually dismissed to military, civil, and even ecclesiastical em- 
ployments: the longer their stay, the higher was their expectation; till, 
at a mature period, they were admitted into the number of the forty 
agas, who stood before the sultan, and were promoted by his choice to 
the government of provinces and the first honours of the empire. 00 Such

the Ottoman policy, and the transmutation of Christian children into Turkish 
soldiers.

a mode of institution was admirably adapted to the form and spirit of 
a despotic monarchy. The ministers and generals were, in the strictest 
sense, the slaves of the emperor, to whose bounty they were indebted 
for their instruction and support. When they left the seraglio, and suf- 
fered their heads to grow as the symbol of enfranchisement, they found 
themselves in an important office, without faction or friendship, without 
parents and without heirs, dependent on the hand which had raised them 
from the dust, and which, on the slightest displeasure, could break in 
pieces these statues of glass, as they are aptly termed by the Turkish 
proverb. 91 In the slow and painful steps of education, their characters 
and talents were unfolded to a discerning eye: the man, naked anrf 
alone, was reduced to the standard of his personal merit; and, if the 
soverign had wisdom to choose, he possessed a pure and boundless 
liberty of choice. The Ottoman candidates were trained by the virtues 
of abstinence to those of action; by the habits of submission to those of 
command. A similar spirit was diffused among the troops; and their 
silence and sobriety, their patience and modesty, have extorted the 
reluctant praise of their Christian enemies. 02 Nor can the victor} 
appear doubtful, if we compare the discipline and exercise of the Jani- 
zaries with the pride of birth, the independence of chivalry, the igno- 
rance of the new levies, the mutinous temper of th eveterans, and the 
vices of intemperance and disorder which so long contaminated the 
armies of Europe. 

The only hope of salvation for the Greek empire and the adjacent 
kingdoms would have been some more powerful weapon, some discovery 
in the art of war, that should give them a decisive superiority over 
their Turkish foes. Such a weapon was in their hands; such a discovery 
had been made in the critical moment of their fate. The chemists of 
China or Europe had found, by casual or elaborate experiments, that a 
mixture of saltpetre, sulphur, and charcoal produces, with a spark of 
fire, a tremendous explosion. It was soon observed that, if the expan- 
sive force were compressed in a strong tube, a ball of stone or iron 
might be expelled with irresistible and destructive velocity. The pre- 
cise era of the invention and application of gunpowder 8 is involved iir 
doubtful traditions and equivocal language; yet we may clearly dis 
cern that it was known before the middle of the fourteenth century, 
and that before the end of the same the use of artillery in battles and 
sieges by sea and land was familiar to the states of Germany, Italy. 
Spain, France, and England. 94 The priority of nations is of small ac-

count; none could derive any exclusive benefit from their previous or 
superior knowledge; and in the common improvement they stood on 
the same level of relative power and military science. Nor was it pos- 
sible to circumscribe the secret within the pale of the church; it was 
disclosed to the Turks by the treachery of apostates and the selfish pol- 
icy of rivals; and the sultans had sense to adopt, and wealth to reward, 
the talents of a Christian engineer. The Genoese, who transported 
Amurath into Europe, must be accused as his preceptors; and it was 
probably by their hands that his cannon was cast and directed at the 
siege of Constantinople. 95 The first attempt was indeed unsuccessful; 
but in the general warfare of the age the advantage was on their side 
who were most commonly the assailants; for a while the proportion 
of the attack and defence was suspended, and this thundering artillery 
was pointed against the walls and towers which had been erected only 
to resist the less potent engines of antiquity. By the Venetians the use 
of gunpowder was communicated without reproach to the sultans of 
Egypt and Persia, their allies against the Ottoman power; the secret 
was soon propagated to the extremities of Asia; and the advantage of 
the European was confined to his easy victories over the savages of the 
new world. If we contrast the rapid progress of this mischievous dis- 
covery with the slow and laborious advances of reason, science, and the 
arts of peace, a philosopher, according to his temper, will laugh or weep 
at the folly of mankind.

IN the four last centuries of the Greek emperors their friendly or hostile 
aspect towards the pope and the Latins may be observed as the ther- 
mometer of their prosperity or distress as the scale of the rise and fall 
of the barbarian dynasties. When the Turks of the house of Seljuk 

passages are collected by Ducange (Gloss. Latin, torn. i, p. 675, B&amp;mbarda). 
But in the early doubtful twilight, the name, sound, fire, and effect, that 
seem to express our artillery, may be fairly interpreted of the old engines 
and the Greek fire. For the English cannon at Crecy, the authority of 
John Villani (Chron. L xii. c. 65) must be weighed against the silence of 
Froissard. Yet Muratori (Antiquit. Italiae medii JEvi, torn. ii. Dissert, 
xxvi. p. 514, 515) has produced a decisive passage from Petrarch (De 
Remediis utriusque Fortunse Dialog.), who, before th year 1344, execrates 
this terrestrial thunder, nuper rara, nunc communis.

duces before Belgrade (A.D. 1436), is mentioned by Chalcocbndyles (1. v.

THE ROMAN EMPIRE 687 

pervaded Ask, and threatened Constantinople, we have seen at the 
council of Placentia the suppliant ambassadors of Alexius imploring the 
protection of the common father of the Christians. No sooner had the 
arms of the French pilgrims removed the sultan from Nice to Iconium 
than the Greek princes resumed, or avowed, their genuine hatred and 
contempt for the schismatics of the West, which precipitated the first 
downfall of their empire. The date of the Mogul invasion is marked in 
the soft and charitable language of John Vataces. After the recovery 
of Constantinople the throne of the first Palseologus was encompassed 
by foreign and domestic enemies: as long as the sword of Charles was 
suspended over his head he basely courted the favour of the Roman 
pontiff, and sacrificed to the present danger his faith, his virtue, and the 
affection of his subjects. On the decease of Michael the prince arid 
people asserted the independence of their church and the purity of their 
creed: the elder Andronicus neither feared nor loved the Latins; in his 
last distress pride was the safeguard of superstition; nor could he de- 
cently retract in his age the firm and orthodox declarations of his youth. 
His grandson, the younger Andronicus, was less a slave in his temper 
ajid situation; and the conquest of Bithynia by the Turks admonished 
him to seek a temporal and spiritual alliance with the Western princes. 
After a separation and silence of fifty years a secret agent, the monk 
Barlaam, was despatched to Pope Benedict the Twelfth; and his artful 
instructions appear to have been drawn by the master-hand of the great 
domestic. 1 a Most holy father," was he commissioned to say, " the em- 
peror is not less desirous than yourself of a union between the two 
churches;^ but in this delicate transaction he is obliged to respect his 
own dignity and the prejudices of his subjects. The ways of union are 
twofold, force and persuasion. Of force, tie inefficacy has been already 
tried, since the Latins have subdued the empire without subduing the 
minds of the Greeks. The method of persuasion, though slow, is sure 
and permanent. A deputation of thirty or forty of our doctors would 
probably agree with those of the Vatican in the love of truth and the 
unity of belief; but on their return, what would be the use, the recom- 
pense, of such agreement? the scorn of their brethren, and the reproaches 
of a blind and obstinate nation, Yet that nation is accustomed to rev- 
erence the general councils which have fixed the articles of our faith; 
and if they reprobate the decrees of Lyons, it is because the Eastern 
churches were neither heard nor represented in that arbitrary meeting. 
For this salutary end it will be expedient, and even necessary, that a! 
well-chosen legate should be sent into Greece to convene the patriarchs 
of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, and with their 
aid to prepare a free and universal synod. But at this moment," 

'This curious instruction was transcribed (I believe) from the Vatican 
archives by Odoricus Raynaldus, in his Continuation of the Annals of 
Baromus (Rom* ,1646-1677, in ten volumes in folio). I have contented

continued the subtle agent, " the empire is assaulted and endangered 
by the Turks, who have occupied four of the greatest cities of Ana- 
tolia. The Christian inhabitants have expressed a wish of returning 
to their allegiance and religion; but the forces and revenues of the 
emperor are insufficient for their deliverance: and the Roman legate 
must be accompanied or preceded by an army of Franks to expel the 
infidels, and open a way to the holy sepulchre." If the suspicious Latins 
should require some pledge, some previous effect of the sincerity of the 
Greeks, the answers of Barlaam were perspicuous and rational. " i. A 
general synod can alone consummate the union of the churches; nor 
can such a synod be held till the three Oriental patriarchs and a great 
number of bishops are enfranchised from the Mohammedan yoke. 2. 
The Greeks are alienated by a long series of oppression and injury: they 
must be reconciled by some act of brotherly love, some effectual suc- 
cour, which may fortify the authority and arguments of the emperor 
and the friends of the union. 3. If some difference of faith or cere- 
monies should be found incurable, the Greeks however are the disciples 
of Christ, and the Turks are the common enemies of the Christian name. 
The Armenians, Cyprians, and Rhodians are equally attacked; and it 
will become the piety of the French princes to draw their swords in the 
general defence of religion. 4. Should the subjects of Andronicus be 
treated as the worst of schismatics, of. heretics, of pagans, a judicious 
policy may yet instruct the powers of the West to embrace a useful 
ally, to uphold a sinking empire, to guard the confines of Europe, and 
rather to join the Greeks against the Turks than to expect the union of 
the Turkish arms with the troops and treasures of captive Greece." 
The reasons, the offers, and the demands of Andronicus were eluded 
with cold and stately indifference. The kings of France and Naples 
declined the dangers and glory of a crusade: the pope refused to call a 
new synod to determine old articles of faith; and his regard for the 
obsolete claims of the Latin emperor and clergy engaged him to use an 
offensive superscription " To the moderator 2 of the Greeks, and the 
persons who style themselves the patriarchs of the Eastern churches." 
For such an embassy a time and character less propitious could not 
easily have been found. Benedict the Twelfth 8 was a dull peasant, 
perplexed with scruples, and immersed in sloth and wine: his pride 

*The ambiguity of this title is happy or ingenious; and moderator, as 
synonymous to rector, gubernator, is a word of classical, and even Circeronian, 
Latinity, which may be found, not in the Glossary of Ducange, but in the 
Thesaurus of Robert Stephens. 

3 The first epistle (sine titulo) of Petrarch exposes the danger of the bark 
and the incapacity of the filot. Haec inter, vino madidus, aevo gravis, ac 
soporifero ^ rore perfusus, jamjam nutitat, dormitat, jam somno praeceps,

casset aratro, quam scalmum piscatorium ascendisset! This satire engages 
his biographer to weigh the virtues and vices of Benedict XII., which have 
been exaggerated by Guelphs and Ghibelines, by Papists and Protestants

He gave occasion to the saying, Bibamus papaliter.

might enrich with a third crown the papal tiara, but he was alike unfit 
for the regal and the pastoral office. 

After the decease of Andronicus, while the Greeks were distracted by 
intestine war, they could not presume to agitate a general union of the 
Christians. But as soon as Cantacuzene had subdued and pardoned 
his enemies, he was anxious to justify, or at least to extenuate, the in- 
troduction of the Turks into Europe and the nuptials of his daughter 
with a Musulman prince. Two officers of state, with a Latin interpreter, 
were sent in his name to the Roman court, which was transplanted to 
Avignon, on the banks of the Rhone, during a period of seventy years: 
they represented the hard necessity which had urged him to embrace thf 
alliance of the miscreants, and pronounced by his command the specious 
and edifying sounds of union and crusade. Pope Clement the Sixth/ 
the successor of Benedict, received them with hospitality and honour, 
acknowledged the innocence of their sovereign, excused his distress, ap- 
plauded his magnanimity, and displayed a clear knowledge of the state 
and revolutions of the Greek empire, which he had imbibed from the 
honest accounts of a Savoyard lady, an attendant of the empress Anne. 5 
If Clement was ill endowed with the virtues of a priest, he possessed 
however the spirit and magnificence of a prince whose liberal hand dis- 
tributed benefices and kingdoms with equal facility. Under his reign 
Avignon was the seat of pomp and pleasure: in his youth he had sur- 
passed the licentiousness of a baron; and the palace, nay the bed- 
chamber of the pope, was adorned, or polluted, by the visits of his 
female favourites. The wars of France and England were adverse to 
the holy enterprise; but his vanity was amused by the splendid idea: 
and the Greek ambassadors returned with two Latin bishops, the min- 
isters of the pontiff. On their arrival at Constantinople the emperor 
and the nuncios admired each other's piety and eloquence; and their 
frequent conferences were filled with mutual praises and promises, by 
which both parties were amused, and neither could be deceived. " I am 
delighted," said the devout Cantacuzene, " with the project of our holy 
war, which must redound to my personal glory as well as to the public 
benefit of Christendom. My dominions will give a free passage to the 
armies of France: my troops, my galleys, my treasures, shall be conse- 
crated to the common cause; and happy would be my fate could I de- 
serve and obtain the crown of martyrdom. Words are insufficient to 
express the ardour with which I sigh for the reunion of the scattered

members of Christ. If my death could avail, I would gladly present my 
sword and my neck: if the spiritual phoenix could arise from my ashes, 
I would erect the pile and kindle the flame with my own hands." Yet 
the Greek emperor presumed to observe that the articles of faith which 
divided the two churches had been introduced by the pride and precipi- 
tation of the Latins: he disclaimed the servile and arbitrary steps of the 
first Palseologus, and firmly declared that he would never submit his 
conscience unless to the decrees of a free and universal synod. " The 
situation of the times," continued he, " will not allow the pope and 
myself to meet either at Rome or Constantinople; but some maritime 
city may be chosen on the verge of the two empires, to unite the 
bishops, and to instruct the faithful of the East and West*" The nun- 
cios seemed content with the proposition; and Cantacuzene affects to 
deplore the failure of his hopes, which were soon overthrown by the 
death of Clement, and the different temper of his successor.' His own 
life was prolonged, but it was prolonged in a cloister; and, except by his 
prayers, the humble monk was incapable of directing the counsels of 
his pupil or the state. 6 

, Yet of all the Byzantine princes, that pupil, John Palseologus, was 
'the best disposed to embrace, to believe, and to obey the shepherd of 
the West. His mother, Anne of Savoy, was baptised in the bosom of 
the Latin church: her marriage with Andronicus imposed a change of 
name, of apparel, and of worship, but her heart was still faithful to her 
country and religion: she had formed the infancy of her son, and she 
governed the emperor after his mind, or at least his stature, was en- 
larged to the size of man. In the first year of his deliverance and 
restoration the Turks were still masters of the Hellespont; the son of 
Cantacuzene was in arms at Adrianople, and Palseologus could depend 
neither on himself nor on his people. By his mother's advice, and in 
the hope of foreign aid, he abjured the rights both of the drurch and 
state; and the act of slavery, 7 subscribed in purple ink, and sealed with 
the golden bull, was privately intrusted to an Italian agent. The first 
article of the treaty is ah oath of fidelity and obedience to Innocent 
the Sixth and his successors, the supreme pontiffs of the Roman and 
Catholic church. The emperor promises to entertain with due reverence 
their legates and nuncios, 'to assign a palace for their residence and a 
temple for their worship, and to deliver his second son Manuel as the- 
hostage of his faith. For these condescensions he requires a prompt 
succour of fifteen galleys, .with five hundred men-at-arms and a thou- 
sand archers, to serve against his Christian and Musulman enemies, 
Palseologus engages to impose on his clergy and people the same spiritual

yoke;, but as the resistance of the Greeks might be justly foreseen, he 
adopts the two effectual methods of corruption and , education. The 
legate was empowered to distribute the vacant benefices among the 
ecclesiastics who should subscribe the creed of the Vatican: three schools 
were instituted to instruct the youth of Constantinople in the language 
and doctrine of the Latins; and the name of Andronicus, the heir of the 
empire, was enrolled as the first student. Should he fail in the meas- 
ures of persuasion or force, Palseologus declares himself unworthy to 
reign, transfers to the pope all regal and paternal authority, and invests 
Innocent with full power to regulate the family, the government, and 
the marriage of his son and successor. But this treaty was neither exe- 
cuted nor published: the Roman galleys were as vain and imaginary- as 
the submission of the Greeks; and it was only by the secrecy that their 
sovereign escaped the dishonour of this fruitless humiliation. 

The tempest of the Turkish arms soon burst on his head; and after the 
loss of Adrianople and Romania he was enclosed in his capital, the vas- 
sal of the haughty Amurath, with the miserable hope of being the last 
devoured by the savage. In this abject state Palaeologus embraced the 
resolution of embarking for Venice, and casting himself at the feet of 
the pope; he was^the first of the Byzantine princes who had ever visited 
the unknown regions of the West, yet in them alone he could seek con^ 
solation or relief; and with less violation of his dignity be might appear 
in the sacred college than at the Ottoman Porte. After a long absence 
the Roman pontiffs were returning from Avignon to the hanks of the 
Tiber: Urban the Fifth, 8 of a mild and virtuous character, encouraged 
or allowed the pilgrimage of the Greek prince, and, within the same 
year, enjoyed the glory of receiving in the Vatican the two. Imperial 
shadows who represented the majesty of Constantine and Charlemagne. 
Iii this suppliant visit the emperor of Constantinople, whose vanity was 
lost in his distress, gave more than could be expected of empty sounds 
and formal submissions. A previous trial was imposed; and in the 
presence of four cardinals he acknowledged, as a true Catholic, the 
supremacy of the pope, and the double procession of the Holy Ghost. 
After this purification he was introduced to a public audience in the 
church of St Peter: Urban, in the midst of the cardinals, was seated 
on his throne; the Greek monarch, after three genuflexions, devoutly 
kissed the feet, the hands, and at length the mouth of the holy father, 
who celebrated high mass in his presence, allowed him to lead the britfte 
of his. mule, and treated him with a sumptuous banquet in the Vatican. 
The entertainment of Palaeologus was friendly and honourable, yet 
some difference was observed between the emperors of the East and

Eccles torn. xx. p. 223, 224). Yet, from some variations, I suspect the 
papal writers of slightly magnifying the genuflexions of Palaeologus.

West; nor could the former be entitled to the rare privilege of chanting 
the Gospel in the rank of a deacon. 10 In favour of his proselyte, Urban 
strove to rekindle the zeal of the French king and the other powers of 
the West; but he found them cold in the general cause, and active only 
in their domestic quarrels. The last hope of the emperor was in an 
English mercenary, John Hawkwood, 11 or Acuto, who,, with a band of 
adventurers, the White Brotherhood, had ravaged Italy from the Alps 
to Calabria, sold his services to the hostile states, and incurred a just 
excommunication by shooting his arrows against the papal residence. 
A special licence was granted to negotiate with the outlaw, but the 
forces, or the spirit, of Hawkwood were unequal to the enterprise: and 
it was for the advantage perhaps of Palaeologus to be disappointed of 
a succour that must have been costly, that could not be effectual, and 
which might have been dangerous. 12 The disconsolate Greek 13 pre- 
prepared for his return, but even his return was impeded by a most igno- 
minious obstacle. On his arrival at Venice he had borrowed large sums 
at exorbitant usury; but his coffers were empty, his creditors were im- 
patient, and his person was -detained as the best security for the pay- 
ment. His eldest son Andronicus, the regent of Constantinople, was 
repeatedly urged to exhaust every resource, and even by stripping the 
churches, to extricate his father from captivity and disgrace. But the 
unnatural youth was insensible of the disgrace, and secretly pleased 
with the captivity of the emperor: the state was poor, the clergy was 
obstinate; nor could some religious scruple be wanting to excuse the 
guilt of his indifference and delay. Such undutiful neglect was severely

of Imperator Graecorum was no longer disputed (Vit. Urban V., p. 623). 

w lt was confined to the successors of Charlemagne, and to them only on 
Christmas Day. On all other festivals these Imperial deacons were con- 
tent to serve the pope, as he said mass, with the book and the corporal. 
Yet the abbe de Sade generously thinks that the merits of Charles IV. 
might have entitled him, though not on the proper day (A.D. 1368, November i), 
to the whole privilege. He seems to affix a just value on the privilege and 
the man (Vie de Petrarque, torn. iii. p. 735). 

tt Through t some Italian corruptions, the etymology of Falcone in bosco 
(Matteo [Filippo] Villani, 1. xi. c. 79, in Muratori, torn. xiv. p. 746) suggests 
the English word Hawkwood, the true name of our adventurous countryman 
(Thomas Walsingham, Hist Anglican, inter Scriptores Camdeni, p. 184). 
After two-and-twenty victories and one defeat, he died, in 1394, general 
of the Florentines, and was buried with such honours as the republic has 
not paid to Dante or Petrarch (Muratori, Annali d'ltalia, torn. xii. p. 212-371). 

*This torrent of English (by birth or service) overflowed from France 
into Italy after the peace of Bretigny in 1360. Yet the exclamation of 
Muratori (Annali, torn. xii. p. 197) is rather true than civil. "Ci mancava 
ancor questo, che dopo essere calpestrata 1'Italia da tanti masnadieri Tedeschi 
ed Ungheri, venissero fin dall* Inghliterra nuovi cant a finire di divorarla." 

M Chalcocondyles, I. i. p. 25, 26 [p. 50, sq., ed. Bonn]. The Greek supposes 
his journey to the king of France, which is sufficiently refuted by the silence 
of the national historians. Nor am I much more inclined to believe that 
Palaeologus departed from Italy, valde bene consolatus et contentus (Vit 
Urban V. p. 623). 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 693 

reproved by the piety of his brother Manuel, who instantly sold or 
mortgaged all that he possessed, embarked for Venice, relieved his 
father, and pledged his own freedom to be responsible for the debt. On 
his return to Constantinople the parent and king distinguished his two 
sons with suitable rewards; but the faith and manners of the slothful 
Palaeologus had not been improved by his Roman pilgrimage; and his 
apostacy or conversion, devoid of any spiritual or temporal effects, was 
speedily forgotten by the Greeks and Latins. 14 

Thirty years after the return of Palseologus, his son and successor 
Manuel, from a similar motive, but on a larger scale, again visited the 
countries of the West. In a preceding chapter I have related his treaty 
with Bajazet, the violation of that treaty, the siege or blockade of 
Constantinople, and the French succour under the command of the gal- 
lant Boucicault. 15 By his ambassadors Manuel had solicited the Latin 
powers; but it was thought that the presence of a distressed monarch 
would draw tears and supplies from the hardest barbarians, 10 and the 
marshal who advised the journey prepared the reception of the By- 
zantine prince. The land was occupied by the Turks; but the navi- 
gation of Venice was safe and open: Italy received him as the first, or 
at least as the second, of the Christian princes; Manuel was pitied as 
the champion and confessor of the faith, and the dignity of his be- 
haviour prevented that pity from sinking into contempt. From Venice 
he proceeded to Padua and Pavia; and even the Duke of Milan, a 
secret ally of Bajazet, gave him safe and honourable conduct to the 
verge of his dominions. 17 On the confines of France 18 the royal officers 
undertook the care of his person, journey, and expenses; and two thou- 
sand of the richest citizens, in arms and on horseback, came forth to 
meet him as far as Charenton, in the neighbourhood of the capital. At 
the gates of Paris he was saluted by the chancellor and the parliament; 
and Charles the Sixth, attended by his princes and nobles, welcomed 
his brother with a cordial embrace. The successor of Constantine was 
clothed in a robe of white silk and mounted on a milk-white steed, a 
circumstance, in the French ceremonial, of singular importance: the 
white colour is considered as the symbol of sovereignty; and in a late 

"His return in 1370, and the coronation of Manuel, Sept 25, 1373 (Ducange,

visit the German emperor, after a haughty demand and a peevish re- 
fusal, had been reduced to content himself with a black courser. Man- 
uel was lodged in the Louvre: a succession of feasts and balls, the pleas- 
ures of the banquet and the chase, were ingeniously varied by the 
politeness of the French to display their magnificence and amuse his 
grief; he was indulged in the liberty of his chapel, and the doctors of 
the Sorbonne were astonished, and possibly scandalised, by the lan- 
guage, the rites, and the vestments of his Greek clergy. But the slight- 
est glance on the state of the kingdom must teach him to despair of any 
effectual assistance. The unfortunate Charles, though he enjoyed 
some lucid intervals, continually relapsed into furious or stupid insanity; 
the reigns of government were alternately seized by his brother and 
uncle, the dukes of Orleans and Burgundy, whose factious competition 
prepared the miseries of civil war. The former was a gay youth, dis- 
solved in luxury and love: the latter was the father of John count of 
Nevers, who had so lately been ransomed from Turkish captivity; and, 
if the fearless son was ardent to revenge his defeat, the more prudent 
Burgundy was content with the cost and peril of the first experiment. 
When Manuel had satiated the curiosity, and perhaps fatigued the 
patience of the French, he resolved on a visit to the adjacent island. 
In bis progress from Dover he was entertained at Canterbury with due 
reverence by the prior and monks of St. Austin, and, on Blackheath, 
king Henry the Fourth, with the English court, saluted the Greek hero 
(I copy our old historian), who, during many days, was lodged and 
treated in London as emperor of the East. 19 But the state of England 
was still more adverse to the design of the holy war. In the sainfe year 
the hereditary sovereign had been deposed and murdered: the reigning 
prince was a successful usurper, whose ambition was punished by jeal- 
ousy and remorse; nor could Henry of Lancaster withdraw his person 
or forces from the defence of a throne incessantly shaken by conspiracy 
and rebellion. He pitied, he praised, he feasted, the emperor of Con- 
stantinople; but if the English monarch assumed the cross, it was only 
to appease his people, and perhaps his conscience, by the mferit or sem- 
blance of this pious intention. 20 Satisfied, however, with gifts and hon- 
ours, Manuel returned to Paris; and, after a residence of two years in 
the West, shaped his course through Germany and Italy, embarked at 
Venice, and patiently expected, in the Morea, the moment of his ruin 
or deliverance. Yet he had escaped the ignominious necessity of offer-

ing his religion to public or private sale. The Latin church was dis- 
tracted by the great schism: the kings, the nations, the universities of 
Europe, were divided in their obedience between the popes of Rome 
and Avignon; and the emperor, anxious to conciliate the friendship of 
both parties, abstained from any correspondence with the indigent and 
unpopular rivals. His journey coincided with the year of the jubilee; 
but he passed through Italy without desiring or deserving the plenary 
indulgence which abolished the guilt or penance of the sins of the faith- 
ful. The Roman pope was offended by this neglect, accused him of 
irreverence to an image of Christ, and exhorted the princes of Italy to 
reject and abandon the obstinate schismatic. 21 

During the period of the crusades the Greeks beheld with astonish- 
ment and terror the perpetual stream of emigration that flowed, and 
continued to flow, from the unknown climates of the West. The visits 
of their last emperors removed the veil of separation, and they disclosed 
to their eyes the powerful nations of Europe, whom they no longer pre- 
sumed to brand with the name of barbarians. The observations of 
Manuel and his more inquisitive followers have been preserved by a 
Byzantine historian of the times: 22 his scattered ideas I shall collect 
and abridge; and it may be amusing enough, perhaps instructive, to 
contemplate the rude pictures of Germany, France, and England, whose 
ancient and modern state are so familiar to our imhids. I. GERMANY 
(says the Greek Chalcocondyles) is of ample latitude from Vienna to 
the Ocean, and it stretches (a strange geography) from Prague, in Bo- 
hemia, to the river Tartessus and the Pyrenaean mountains. 24 The soil^ 
except in figs and olives, is sufficiently fruitful; the air is salubrious, 
the bodies of the natives are robust and healthy, and these cold regions 
are seldom visited with the calamities of pestilence or earthquakes. 
After the Scythians or Tartars, the Germans are the most numerous of 
nations: they are brave and patient, and, were they uitfted under a 
single head, their force would be irresistible. By the gift of the pope, 
they have acquired the privilege of choosing the Roman emperor; 2 * 

"This fact is preserved in the Historia Politica, A.D. 1391-1478, published 
by Martin Crusius (Turco-Gracia, p. 1-43). The image of Christ, which 
the Greek emperor refused to worship, was probably a work of sculpture, 

81 The Greek and Turkish history of Laonicus Chalcocondyles ends with 
the winter of 1463, and the abrupt conclusion seems to mark that he laid 
down his pen in the same year. We know that he was an Athenian, and 
that some contemporaries of the same name contributed to the revival of 
the Greek language in Italy. But in his numerous digressions the modest 
historian has never introduced himself; and his editor Leunclavius, as 
well as Fabricius (Biblioth. Grsec. torn. vi. p. 474), seems ignorant of his 
life and character. For his descriptions of Germany, France, and England, 
see 1. ii. p. 36, 37, 44-50 [p. 70-72, 85-96, ed. Bonn]. 

I shall not animadvert on the geographical errors of Chalcocondyles. 
In this instance he perhaps followed, and mistook, Herodotus (1. ii. c. 33), 
whose text may be explained (Herodote de Larcher, torn. ii. p. 219, 220), 
or whose ignorance may be excused. Had these modem Greeks never 
cead Strabo, or any of their lesser geographers?

nor is any people more devoutly attached to the faith and obedience of 
the Latin patriarch. The greatest part of the country is divided among 
the princes and prelates; but Strasburg, Cologne, Hamburg, and more 
than two hundred free cities, are governed by sage and equal laws, ac- 
cording to the will and for the advantage of the whole community. The 
use of duels, or single combats on foot, prevails among them in peace 
and war; their industry excels in all the mechanic arts; and the Ger- 
mans may boast of the invention of gunpowder and cannon, which is 
now diffused over the greatest part of the world. II. The kingdom of 
PRANCE is spread above fifteen or twenty days' journey from Germany 
to Spain, and from the Alps to the British Ocean, containing many 
flourishing cities, and among these Paris, the seat of the king, which 
surpasses the rest in riches and luxury. Many princes and lords alter- 
nately wait in his palace and acknowledge him as their sovereign: the 
most powerful are the dukes of Bretagne and Burgundy, of whom the 
latter possesses the wealthy province of Flanders, whose Jiarbours are 
frequented by the ships and merchants of our own and the more remote 
seas. The French are an ancient and opulent people, and their language 
and manners, though somewhat different, are nof dissimilar from those 
of the Italians. Vain of the Imperial dignity of Charlemagne, of their 
victories over the Saracens, and of the exploits of their heroes Oliver 
and Rowland, 25 they esteem themselves the first of the western nations; 
but this foolish arrogance has been recently humbled by the unfor- 
tunate events of their wars against the English, the inhabitants of the 
British island. III. BRITAIN, in the ocean and opposite to the shores 
of Flanders, may be considered either as one or as three islands; but 
the whole is united by a common interest, by the same manners, and 
by a similar government. The measure of its circumference is five 
thousand stadia: the land is overspread with towns and villages; though 
destitute of wine, and not abounding in fruit-trees, it is fertile in wheat 
and barley, in honey and wool, and much doth is manufactured by the 
inhabitants. In populousness and power, in riches and luxury, Lon- 
don, 26 the metropolis of the isle, may claim a pre-eminence over all the

into French prose, and soon became the favourite amusement of the knights 
and ladies in the court of Charles VI. If a Greek believed in the exploits 
of Rowland and Oliver, he may surely be excused, since the monks of St 
Denys, the national historians, have inserted the fables of Archbishop 
Turpin in their Chronicles of France.

cities of the West. It is situate on the Thames, a broad and rapid 
river, which at the distance of thirty miles falls into the Gallic Sea; 
and the daily flow and ebb of the tide affords a safe entrance and de- 
parture to the vessels of commerce. The king is the head of a powerful 
and turbulent aristocracy: his principal vassals hold their estates by a 
free and unalterable tenure, and the laws define the limits of his author- 
ity and their obedience. The kingdom has been often afflicted by for- 
eign conquest and domestic sedition; but the natives are bold and hardy , 
renowned in arms and victorious in war. The form of their shields or 
targets is derived from the Italians, that of their swords from the 
Greeks; the use of the long bow is the peculiar and decisive advantage 
of the English. Their language bears no affinity to the idioms of the 
continent: in the habits of domestic life they are not easily distinguished 
from their neighbours of France; but the most singular circumstance 
of their manners is their disregard of conjugal honour and of female 
chastity. In their mutual visits, as the first act of hospitality, the guest 
is welcomed in the embraces of their wives and daughters: among friends 
they are lent and borrowed without shame; nor are the islanders of- 
fended at this strange commerce and its inevitable consequences.* 1 
Informed as we are of the .customs of old England, and assured of the 
virtue of our mothers, we may smile at the credulity, or resent the injus- 
tice, of the Greek, who must have confounded a modest salute * 8 with 
a criminal embrace. But his credulity and injustice may teach an im- 
portant lesson, to distrust the accounts of foreign and remote nations, 
and to suspend our belief of every tale that deviates from the laws of 
nature and the character of man. 2:&gt;

97 If the double sense of the verb Kfo (osculor, and in utero gero) be 
equivocal, the context and pious horror of Chalcocondyles can leave no 
doubt of his meaning and mistake (p. 49 [p. 93, ed. Bonn]).

in its more innocent sense. Nor can the phrase vap^xovTat rfa favrtow 
TUWUJCOS h TOLS brirqhiois, well bear a less coarse interpretation. "Gibbon 
is probably right as to the origin of this extraordinary mistake," says 
Milman. To this Dr. W. Smith adds that it may be observed that this 
idea of the unchastity of the English seems to have been prevalent amongst 
the Greeks. Finally, Prof. Bury says there is no ambiguity. Chalcocondyles 
uses the middle form /cuecrflcu, instead of the active icveiv which is used in 
classical Greek: but there is no second sense. Neither Ktfw nor Kvw is ever 
used in the sense of KVP to kiss. It is only in the aorist $/d5&lt;ro: &amp;fra that

698 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

After bis return, and the victory of Timour, Manuel reigned many 
years in prosperity and peace. As long as the sons of Bajazet solicited 
his friendship and spared his dominions, he was satisfied with the na- 
tional religion; and his leisure was employed in composing twenty theo- 
logical dialogues for its defence. The appearance of the Byzantine am- 
bassadors at the council of Constance 80 announces the restoration of 
the Turkish power, as well as of the Latin church: the conquest of the 
sultans, Mohammed and Amurath, reconciled the emperor to the Vati- 
can; and the siege of Constantinople almost tempted him to acquiesce 
in ; the double procession of the Holy Ghost. When Martin the Fifth 
ascended without a rival the chair of St. Peter, a friendly intercourse 
of. letters and embassies was revived between the East and West. Am- 
bition on one side, and distress on the other, dictated the same decent 
language of charity and peace: the artful Greek expressed a desire of 
marrying his six sons to Italian princesses; and the Roman, not less 
artful, despatched the daughter of the marquis of Montferrat, with a 
company of noble virgins, to soften, by their charms, the obstinacy of 
the schismatics. Yet under this mask of zeal a discerning eye will per- 
ceive that all was hollow and insincere in the court and church of Con- 
stantinople. According to the vicissitudes of danger and repose, the 
emperor advanced or retreated; alternately instructed and disavowed 
his ministers; and escaped from an importunate pressure by urging the 
duty of inquiry, the obligation of collecting the sense of his patriarchs 
and bishops, and the impossibility of convening them at a time when the 
Turkish arms were at the gates of his capital. From a review of the 
public transactions it will appear that the Greeks insisted on three suc- 
cessive measures, a succour, a council, and a final reunion, while the 
Latins eluded the second, and only promised the first as a consequential 
aiid voluntary reward of the third. But we have an opportunity of un- 
folding the most secret intentions of Manuel, as he explained them in 
a private conversation without artifice or disguise. In his declining 
age the emperor had associated John Palaeologus, the second of the 
name, and the eldest of his sons, on whom he devolved the greatest part 
of the authority and weight of government. One day, in the presence 
only of the historian Phranza, 81 his favourite chamberlain, he opened 

scandalous in proportion as we have studied the manners of that gentle 
and amorous people. 

IManuel was a voluminous "Defender of the Faith." In twenty-six 
dialogues he wrote a defence of orthodox Christianity against Islam, having 
been suggested by certain conversations which he had at Ancyra in 1390 with 
a Turk. The dialogues are entitled ki6\oyos vepl lijs T&amp;V Xpurricww

to his colleague and successor the true principle of his negotiations with 
the pope. 82 " Our last resource," said Manuel, " against the Turks is 
their fear of our union with the Latins, of the warlike nations of the 
West, who may arm for our relief and for their destruction. As often 
as you are threatened by the miscreants, present this danger before 
their eyes. Propose a council; consult on the means; but ever delay 
and avoid the convocation of an assembly, which cannot tend either tfl 
our' spiritual or temporal emolument. The Latins are proud; the 
Greeks are obstinate; neither party will recede or retract; and the at- 
tempt of a perfect union will confirm the schism, alienate the churches, 
and leave us, without hope or defence, at the mercy of the barbarians.** 
Impatient of this salutary lesson, the royal youth arose from his seat 
and departed in silence; and the wise monarch (continues Phranza), 
casting his eyes on me, thus resumed his discourse: " My son deems 
himself a great and heroic prince; but, alas I our miserable age does not 
afford scope for heroism or greatness. His daring spirit might have 
suited the happier times of our ancestors; but the present state re- 
quires not an emperor, but a cautious steward of the last relics of our 
fortunes. Well do I remember the lofty expectations which he built 
on our alliance with Mustapha; and much do I fear that his rash cour- 
age will urge the ruin of our house, and that even religion may pre- 
cipitate our downfall." Yet the experience and authority of Manuel 
preserved the peace and eluded the council; till, in the seventy-eighth 
year of hJs age, and in the habit of a monk, he terminated his career, 
dividing his precious movables among his children and the poor, hi&amp; 
physicians and his favourite servants. Of his six sons, 83 Andronicus 
the Second was invested with the principality of Thessalonica, and died 
of a leprosy soon after the sale of that city to the Venetians and its 
final conquest by the Turks. Some fortunate incidents had restored 
Peloponnesus, or the Morea, to the empire; and in his more prosperous 
days, Manuel had fortified the narrow isthmus of six miles 84 with a 
stone wall and one hundred and fifty-three towers. The wall was over- 

four-and-twenty years of age at the death of Manuel, who recommended 
him in the strongest terms to his successor: Imprimis vero hunc Phranzea 
tibi commendo, qui mixristravit mihi fideliter et diligenter (Phranzes, L ii. c. I 
[p. 125, ed. Bonn]). Yet the emperor John was cold, and he preferred 
the service of the despots of Peloponnesus. 

"See Phranzes, 1. ii. c. 13 [p. 178, ed. Bonn]. While so many manu- 
scripts o the Greek original are extant in the libraries of Rome, Milan, the 
Escurial, etc., it is a matter of shame and reproach that we should be 
reduced to the Latin version, or abstract, of James Pontanus (ad calcem 
Theophylact. Simocattae: Ingolstadt, 1604), so deficient in accuracy and 
elegance (Fabric. Biblioth. Graec. torn. vi. p. 615-620).

**The exact measure of the Hexamilion, from sea to sea, was 3800 orgyiae, 
or toiscs, of six Greek feet (Phranzes, 1. i. c. 35 [p. 108, ed. Bonn]), which 
would produce a Greek mile still smaller than that of 660 French toises, 
which is assigned by D ; Anville as still in use in Turkey. Five miles are 
commonly reckoned for the breadth of the isthmus. See the Travels of

thrown by the first blast of the Ottomans; the fertile peninsula might 
have been sufficient for the four younger brothers, Theodore and Con- 
stantine, Demetrius and Thomas; but they wasted in domestic contests 
the remains of their strength; and the least successful of the rivals were 
reduced to a life of dependence in the Byzantine palace. 

The eldest of the sons of Manuel, John Palseologus the Second, was 
acknowledged, after his father's death, as the sole emperor of the 
Greeks. He immediately proceeded to repudiate his wife, and to con- 
tract a new marriage with the princess of Trebizond: beauty was in his 
eyes the first qualification of an empress; and the clergy had yielded 
to his firm assurance, that, unless he might be indulged in a divorce, he 
would retire to a cloister and leave the throne to his brother Constan- 
tine. The first, and in truth the only victory of Palseologus, was over 
a Jew, 80 whom, after a long and learned dispute, he converted to the 
Christian faith; and this momentous conquest is carefully recorded in 
the history of the times. But he soon resumed the design of uniting 
the East and the West; and, regardless of his father's advice, listened, 
as it should seem with sincerity, to the proposal of meeting the pope 
in a general council beyond the Adriatic. This dangerous project was 
encouraged by Martin the Fifth, and coldly entertained by his suc- 
cessor Eugenius, till, after a tedious negotiation, the. emperor received 
a summons from a Latin assembly of a new character, the independent 
prelates of Basil, who styled themselves the representatives and judges 
of the Catholic church. 

The Roman pontiff had fought and conquered in the cause of ecclesi- 
astical freedom; but the victorious clergy were soon exposed to the 
tyranny of their deliverer; and his sacred character was invulnerable 
to those arms which they found so keen and effectual against the civil 
magistrate. Their great charter, the right of election, was annihilated 
by appeals, evaded by trusts or commendams, disappointed by rever- 
sionary grants, and superseded by previous and arbitrary reservations. 30 
A public auction was instituted in the court of Rome: the cardinals and 
favourites were enriched with the spoils of nations; and every country 
might complain that the most important and valuable benefices were 
accumulated on the heads of aliens and absentees. During their resi- 
dence at Avignon, the ambition of the popes subsided in the meaner 
passions of avarice 37 and luxury: they rigorously imposed on the clergy 

**The first objection of the Jews is on the death of Christ: if it were 
voluntary, Christ was a suicide: which the emperor parries with a mystery. 
They then dispute on the conception of the Virgin, the sense of the prophecies, 
etc. (Phranzes, 1. ii. c. 12, a whole chapter.) 

30 In the treatise delle Materie Beneficiarie of Fra Paolo (in the fourth 
volume of the last, and best, edition of his works) the papal system is 
deeply studied and freely described. Should Rome and her religion be 
annihilated, this golden volume may still survive, a philosophical history 
and a .salutary warning.

Jewels. See the Chronicle of John Villani (1. xi. c. 20, in Muratori's Collec-

the tributes of first-fruits and tenths; but they freely tolerated the im- 
punity of vice, disorder, and corruption. These manifold scandals were 
aggravated by the great schism of the West, which continued above 
fifty years. In the furious conflicts of Rome and Avignon, the vices 
of the rivals were mutually exposed; and their precarious situation de- 
graded their authority, relaxed their discipline, and multiplied their 
wants and exactions. To heal the wounds, and restore the monarchy, 
of the church, the synods of Pisa and Constance 38 were successively 
convened; but these great assemblies, conscious of their strength, re- 
solved to vindicate the privileges of the Christian aristocracy; From 
a personal sentence against two pontiffs whom they rejected, and a 
third, their acknowledged sovereign, whom they deposed, the fathers 
of Constance proceeded to examine the nature and limits of the Ro- 
man supremacy; nor did they separate till they had established the 
authority, above the pope, of a general council. It was enacted, that, 
for the government and reformation of the church, such assemblies 
should be held at regular intervals; and that each synod, before its 
dissolution, should appoint the time and place of the subsequent meet- 
ing. By the influence of the court of Rome, the next convocation at 
Sienna was easily eluded; but the bold and vigorous proceedings of the 
council of Basil !SO had almost been fatal to the reigning pontiff, Eu- 
genius the Fourth. A just suspicion of his design prompted the fathers 
to hasten the promulgation of their first decree, that the representatives 
of the church-militant on earth were invested with a divine and spiritual 
jurisdiction over all Christians, without excepting the pope; and that a 
general council could not be dissolved, prorogued, or transferred, unless 
by their free deliberation and consent. On the notice that Eugenius 
had fulminated a bull for that purpose, they ventured to summon, to 
admonish, to threaten, to censure, the contumacious successor of St. 
Peter. After many delays, to allow time for repentance, they finally 
declared, that, unless he submitted within the term of sixty days, he 
ras suspended from the exercise of all temporal and ecclesiastical au- 
thority. And to mark their jurisdiction over the prince as well as the 
priest, they assumed the government of Avignon, annulled the aliena- 
tion of the sacred patrimony, and protected Rome from the imposition

century is enormous, and almost incredible. 

"A learned and liberal Protestant, M. Lenfant, has given a fair history 
of the councils of Pisa, Constance, and Basil, in six volumes in quarto ; but 
the last part is the most hasty and imperfect, except in the account of the 
troubles of Bohemia. 

"The original acts or minutes of the council of Basil are preserved in the 
public library, in twelve volumes in folio. Basil was a free city, con- 
veniently situate on the Rhine, and guarded by the arms of the neighbour- 
ing and confederate Swiss. In 1459 the university was founded by pope 
Pius II. (JEneas Sylvius), who had been secretary to the council. But 
what is a council, or a university, to the presses of Froben and the studies 
of Erasmus? 



702 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

of new taxes. Their boldness was justified, not only by the general 
opinion of the clergy, but by the support and power of the first mon- 
archs of Christendom: the emperor Sigismond declared himself the 
servant and protector of the synod; Germany and France adhered to 
their cause; the duke of Milan was the enemy of Eugenius; and he was 
driven from the Vatican by an insurrection of the Roman people. Re- 
jected at the same time by his temporal and spiritual subjects, sub- 
mission was his only choice: by a most humiliating bull, the pope re- 
pealed his own acts, and ratified those of the council; incorporated his 
legates and cardinals with that venerable body; and seemed to resign 
himself to the decrees of the supreme legislature. Their fame pervaded 
the countries of the East: and it was in their presence that Sigismond 
received the ambassadors of the Turkish sultan, 40 who laid at his feet 
twelve large vases filled with robes of silk and pieces of gold. The 
fathers of Basil aspired to the glory of reducing the Greeks, as well 
as the Bohemians, within the pale of the church; and their deputies 
invited the emperor and patriarch of Constantinople to unite with an 
assembly which possessed the confidence of the Western nations. Pa- 
Jseologua was not averse to the proposal; and his ambassadors were in- 
troduced with due honours into the Catholic senate. But the choice 
of the place appeared to be an insuperable obstacle, since he refused to 
pass the Alps, or the sea of Sicily, and positively required that the 
synod should be adjourned to some convenient city in Italy, or at least 
on the Danube. The other articles of this treaty were more readily 
stipulated: it was agreed to defray the travelling expenses of the em- 
peror, with a train of seven hundred persons, 41 to remit an immediate 
sum of eight thousand ducats 42 for 'the accommodation of the Greek 
clergy; and in his absence to grant a supply of ten thousand ducats, 
with three hundred archers and some galleys, for the protection of 
Constantinople. The city of Avignon advanced the funds for the pre- 
liminary expenses; and the embarkation was prepared at Marseilles 
with some difficulty and delay. 

In his distress the friendship of Palseologus was disputed by the 
ecclesiastical powers of the West; but the dexterous activity of a 
monarch prevailed over the slow debates and inflexible temper of a re- 
public. The decrees of Basil continually tended to circumscribe the 
despotism of the pope, and to erect a supreme and perpetual tribunal

in the church. Eugenius was impatient of the yoke; and the union 
of the Greeks might aff ord a decent pretence for translating a rebellious 
synod from the Rhine to the Po. The independence of the fathers 
was lost if they passed the Alps: Savoy or Avignon, to which they ac- 
ceded with reluctance, were described at Constantinople as situate far 
beyond the Pillars of Hercules ; 4 * the emperor and his clergy were 
apprehensive of the dangers of a long navigation; they were offended 
by a haughty declaration, that, after suppressing the new heresy of the 
Bohemians, the council would soon eradicate the old heresy of the 
Greeks. 44 On the side of Eugenius all was smooth, and yielding, and 
respectful; and he invited the Byzantine monarch to heal by his pres- 
ence the schism of the Latin, as well as of the Eastern, church. Fer- 
rara, near the coast of the Adriatic, was proposed for their amicable 
interview: and with some indulgence of forgery and theft, a surreptk 
tious decree was procured, which transferred the synod, with its own 
consent, to that Italian city. Nine galleys were equipped for this serv- 
ice at Venice and in the isle of Candia; their diligence anticipated the 
slower vessels of Basil: the Roman admiral was commissioned to burn, 
sink, and destroy; 45 and these priestly squadrons might have encoun- 
tered each other in the same seas where Athens and Sparta had for- 
merly contended for the pre-eminence of glory. Assaulted by the im- 
portunity of the factions, who were ready to fight for the possession of 
his person, Palaeologus hesitated before he left his palace and country 
on a perilous experiment. His father's advice still dwelt on his mem- 
ory; and reason must suggest, that, since the Latins were divided among 
themselves, they could never unite in a foreign cause. Sigismond dis- 
suaded the unseasonable adventure; his advice was impartial, since he 
adhered to the council; and it was enforced by the strange belief that 
the German Csesar would nominate a Greek his heir and successor in 
the empire of the West. 49 Even the Turkish sultan was a counsellor 
whom it might be unsafe to trust, but whom it was dangerous to of- 

48 At the end of the Latin version of Phranzes we read a long . Greek 
epistle or declamation of George of Trebizond, who advises the emperor 
to prefer Eugenius and Italy. He treats with contempt the schismatic '

spired to transport the chair of St. Peter beyond the Alps; &lt;rt &amp;8\ioi (says

"Syropulus (p. 26-31) attests his own indignation, and that of his country-

deny nor alter an act of the council.

peremptory, and, till the hostile squadrons appeared, both parties tried to 
conceal their quarrel from the Greeks. 

"Syropulus mentions the hopes of Palseologus (p. 36), and the last advice 
of Sigismond (p. 57). At Corfu the Greek emperor was informed of his 
frienas death; had he known it sooner, he would have returned home 
(P. 79).

fend. Amurath was unskilled in the disputes, but he was apprehensive 
of the union, of the Christians. From his own treasures he offered to 
relieve the wants of the Byzantine court; yet he declared with seeming 
magnanimity that Constantinople should be secure and inviolate in the 
absence of her sovereign. 47 The resolution of Palseologus was decided 
by the most splendid gifts and the most specious promises: he wished 
to escape for a while from a scene of danger and distress; and after 
dismissing with an ambiguous answer the messengers of the council, 
he declared his intention of embarking in the Roman galleys. The age 
of the patriarch Joseph was more susceptible of fear than of hope; he 
trembled at the perils of the sea, and expressed his apprehension that 
his feeble voice, with thirty perhaps of his orthodox brethren, would 
be oppressed in a foreign land by the power and numbers of a Latin 
synod. He yielded to the royal mandate, to the flattering assurance 
that he would be heard as the oracle of nations, and to the secret wish 
of learning from his brother of the West to deliver the church from the 
yoke of kings. 48 The five crossbearers, or dignitaries, of St. Sophia, 
were bound to attend his person; and one of these, the great ecclesiarch 
or preacher, Sylvester Syropulus, 40 has composed a free and curious 
history co of the false union. 51 Of the clergy that reluctantly obeyed 
the summons of the emperor and the patriarch, submission was the 
first duty, and patience the most useful virtue. In a chosen list of 
twenty bishops we discover the metropolitan titles of Heraclea and 
Cyzicus, Nice and Nicomedia, Ephesus and Trebizond, and the per- 
sonal merit of Mark and Bessarion, who, in the confidence of their

Amurath (1. ii. c. 13). Utinam tie synodus ista unquam fuisset, si tantas 
offensiones et detrimenta paritura erat. This Turkish embassy is likewise 
mentioned by Syropulus (p. 58) ; and Amurath kept his word. He might 
threaten (p. 125, 219), but he never attacked, the city. 

48 The reader will smile at the simplicity with which he imparted these 
hopes to his favourites: rotating irXypoQoptay crxfoew 4}Xirie jcai 5ta poO Ildira

In modern Greek, TTOV\&lt;JJ, as a diminutive, is added to the end of words: 
nor can any reasoning of Creyghton, the editor, excuse his changing into 
.S0r0pulus (Sguros, fuscus) the Syropulus of his own manuscript, whose 
name is subscribed with his own hand in the acts of the council of Florence. 
Why might not the author be of Syrian extraction? 

00 From the conclusion of the history I should fix the date to the year 
1444, four years after the synod, when the great ecclesiarch had abdicated 
his office (sectio xii. p. 330-350). His passions were cooled by time and 
retirement; and, although Syropulus is often partial, he is never intemperate. 

"V^ra historia unionis non verts inter Graces et Latinos (Hag a Co- 
initis, 1660, in folio) was first published with a loose and florid version, by 
Robert Creyghton, chaplain to Charles II. in his exile. The zeal of the editor 
has prefixed a polemic title, for the beginning of the original is wanting. 
Syropulus may be ranked with the best of the Byzantine writers for the 
merit of his narration, and even of his style; but he is excluded from the 
orthodox collections of the councils.

learning and eloquence, were promoted to the episcopal rank. Some 
monks and philosophers were named to display the science and sanc- 
tity of the Greek church; and the service of the choir was performed 
by a select band of singers and musicians. The patriarchs of Alexan- 
dria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, appeared by their genuine or fictitious 
deputies; the primate of Russia represented a national church, and the 
Greeks might contend with the Latins in the extent of their spiritual 
empire. The precious vases of St. Sophia were exposed to the winds 
and waves, that the patriarch might officiate with becoming splendour: 
whatever gold the emperor could procure was expended in die massy 
ornaments of his bed and chariot; 52 and while they affected to maintain 
the prosperity of their ancient fortune, they quarrelled for the division 
of fifteen thousand ducats, the first alms of the Roman pontiff . After 
the necessary preparations, John Palaeologus, with a numerous train, 
accompanied by his brother Demetrius and the most respectable per- 
sons of the church and state, embarked in eight vessels with sails and 
oars, which steered through the Turkish straits of Gallipoli to the 
Archipelago, the Morea, and the Adriatic Gulf. 63 

After a tedious and troublesome navigation of seventy-seven days, 
this religious squadron cast anchor before Venice; and their reception 
proclaimed the joy and magnificence of that powerful republic. In the 
command of the world the modest Augustus had never claimed such 
honours from his subjects as were paid to his feeble successor by an 
independent state. Seated on the poop, on a lofty throne, he received 
the visit, or, in the Greek style, the adoration, of the doge and sena- 
tors. 54 They sailed in the Bucentaur, which was accompanied by 
twelve stately galleys: the sea was overspread with innumerable gon- 
dolas of pomp and pleasure; the air resounded with music and accla- 
mations; the mariners, and even the vessels, were dressed in silk and 
gold; and in all the emblems and pagea.nts the Roman eagles were 
blended with the lions of St. Mark. The triumphal procession, ascend- 
ing the great canal, passed under the bridge of the Rialto; and the 
Eastern strangers gazed with admiration on the palaces, the churches, 
and the populousness of a city that seems to float on the bosom of the

M Although I cannot stop to quote Syropulus for every fact, I will observe 
that the navigation of the Greeks from Constantinople to Venice and 
Ferrara is contained in the fourth section (p. 67-100), and that the historian 
has the uncommon talent of placing each scene before the reader's eye. 

M At the time of the synod Phranzes was in Peloponnesus: but he 
received from the despot Demetrius a faithful account of the honourable 
reception of the emperor and patriarch both at Venice and Ferrara (Dux . . . 
sedentem Imperatorem adorat), which are more slightly mentioned by the 
Latins (I ii. c. 14. IS, 16)

waves. 55 They sighed to behold the spoils and trophies with which it 
had been decorated after the sack of Constantinople. After an hos- 
pitable entertainment of fifteen days, Palseologus pursued his journey 
.by land and water from Venice to Ferrara; and on this occasion the 
pride of the Vatican was tempered by policy to indulge the ancient 
dignity of the emperor of the East. He made his entry on a black 
horse; but a milk-white steed, whose trappings were embroidered with 
golden eagles, was led before him; and the canopy was borne over his 
head by the princes of Este, the sons or kinsmen of Nicholas, marquis 
of the city, and a sovereign more powerful than himself. 60 Palaeologus 
did not alight till he reached the bottom of the staircase: the pope ad- 
vanced to the door of the apartment; refused his proffered genuflexion; 
and, after a paternal embrace, conducted the emperor to a seat on his 
left hand. Nor would the patriarch descend from his galley till a cere- 
mony, almost equal, had been stipulated between the bishops of Rome 
and Constantinople. The latter was saluted, by his brother with a kiss 
of union and charity; nor would any of the Greek ecclesiastics submit 
to kiss the feet of the Western primate. On the opening of the synod, 
the place of honour in the centre was claimed by the temporal and 
ecclesiastical chiefs; and it was only by alleging that his predecessors 
had not assisted in person at Nice or Chalcedon that Eugenius could 
evade the ancient precedents of Constantine and Marcian. After much 
debate it was agreed that the right and left sides of the church should 
be occupied by the two nations; that the solitary chair of St. Peter 
should be raised the first of the Latin line; and that the throne of the 
Greek emperor, at the head of his clergy, should be equal and opposite 
to the second place, the. vacant seat of the emperor of the West. 67 

But as soon as festivity and form had given place to a more serious 
treaty, the Greeks were dissatisfied with their journey, with themselves, 
and with the pope. The artful pencil of his emissaries had painted him 
in a prosperous state, at the head of the princes and prelates of Europe, 
obedient at his voice to believe and to arm. The thin appearance of 
the universal synod of Ferrara betrayed his weakness; and the Latins 
opened the first session with only five archbishops, eighteen bishops, and 

08 The astonishment of a Greek prince and a French ambassador (Memoires 
de Philippe de Comines, 1. vii. c. 18) at the sight of Venice, abundantly

ten abbots, the greatest part of whom were the subjects or country- 
men of the Italian pontiff. Except the duke of Burgundy, none of the 
potentates of the West condescended to appear in person, or by their 
ambassadors; nor was it possible to suppress the judicial acts of Basil 
against the dignity and person of Eugenius, which were finally con- 
cluded by a new election. Under these circumstances a truce or delay 
was asked and granted, till Palseologus could expect from the consent 
of the Latins some temporal reward for an unpopular union; and, after, 
the first session, the public proceedings were adjourned above six: 
months. The emperor, with a chosen band of his favourites and Jatii* 
zarieS) fixed his summer residence at a pleasant spacious monastery, 
six miles from Ferrara; forgot, in the pleasures of the chase, the dis- 
tress of the church and state; and persisted in destroying the game,' 
without listening to the just complaints of the marquis or the husband- 
men. 58 In the meanwhile his unfortunate Greeks were exposed to all; 
the miseries of exile and poverty; for the support of each stranger a 
monthly allowance was assigned of three or four gold florins, and, al- 
tlymgh the entire sum did not amount to seven hundred florins, a long 
arrear was repeatedly incurred by the indigence or policy of the Roman' 
court. 6 * They sighed for a speedy deliverance, but their escape was 
prevented by a triple chain; a passport from their superiors was te- ; 
quired at the gates of Ferrara; the government of Venice had engaged 
to arrest and send back the fugitives, and inevitable punishment awaited? 
them at Constantinople; excommunication, fines, and a sentence, whicE 
did not respect the- sacerdotal dignity, that they should be stripped 
naked and publicly whipped. 60 It was only by the alternative of hun- 
ger or dispute that the Greeks could be persuaded to open the first 
conference, and they yielded with extreme reluctance to attend from 
Ferrara to Florence the rear of a flying synod. This new- translation 
was urged by inevitable necessity: the city was visited by the plagu6; 
the fidelity of the marquis might be suspected; the mercenary troops; 
of the duke of Milan were at the gates, and,, as they occupied Ro- 
magna&gt; it was not without difficulty and: danger that the pope, the em-

to 691 florins, a sum which will not allow us to reckon above 200 Greeks of 
every condition (Syropulus, p. 104, I05&gt;. On the 20th October, 1438, 
there was an arrear of four months; in April, 1439, of three; and of five 
and, a half in July, at the time of the union (p. 172, 225, 271).

peror, and the bishops explored their way through the unfrequented 
paths of the Apennine. 61 

Yet all these obstacles were surmounted by time and policy. The 
violence of the fathers of Basil rather promoted than injured the cause 
of Eugenius: the nations of Europe abhorred the schism, and disowned 
the election, of Felix the Fifth, who was successively a duke of Savoy, 
a hermit, and a pope; and the great princes were gradually reclaimed 
by his competitor to a favourable neutrality and a firm attachment. 
The legates, with some respectable members, deserted to the Roman 
army, which insensibly rose in numbers and reputation; the council of 
Basil was reduced to thirty-nine bishops and three hundred of the in- 
ferior clergy; 62 while the Latins of Florence could produce the sub- 
scriptions of the pope himself, eight cardinals, two patriarchs, eight 
archbishops, fifty-two bishops, and forty-five abbots or chiefs of reli- 
gious orders. After the labour of nine months and the debates of 
twenty-five sessions, they attained the advantage and glory of the re- 
union of the Greeks. Four principal questions had been agitated be- 
tween the two churches: i. The use of unleavened bread in the com- 
munion of Christ's body. 2. The nature of purgatory. 3. The 
supremacy of the pope. And, 4. The single or double procession of 
the Holy Ghost. The cause of either nation was managed by ten theo- 
logical champions: the Latins were supported by the inexhaustible elo- 
quence of Cardinal Julian, and Mark of Ephesus and Bessarion of 
Kice were the bold and able leaders of the Greek forces. We may be- 
stow some praise on the progress of human reason,, by observing that 
the first of these questions was now treated as an immaterial rite, which 
might innocently vary with the fashion of the age and country. With 
regard to the second, both parties were agreed in the belief of an in- 
termediate state of purgation for the venial sins of the faithful; and 
whether their souls were purified by elemental fire was a doubtful 
point, which in a few years might be conveniently settled on the spot 
by the disputants. The claims of supremacy appeared of a more 
weighty and substantial kind, yet by the Orientals the Roman bishop 
had ever been respected as the first of the five patriarchs; nor did they 
scruple to admit that his jurisdiction should be exercised agreeably to 
the holy canons: a vague allowance, which might be defined or eluded 
by occasional convenience. The procession of the Holy Ghost from the 
Father alone, or from the Father and the Son, was an article of faith 

"The wars of Italy are most clearly represented in the thirteenth volume 
of the Annals of Muratori. The schismatic Greek, Syropulus (p. 145), 
appears to have exaggerated the fear and disorder of the pope in his 
retreat from Ferrara to Florence, which is poved by the acts to have been 
somewhat more decent and deliberate. 

** Syropulus is pleased to reckon seven hundred prelates in the council 
of Basil The error is manifest, and perhaps voluntary. That extravagant 
number could not be supplied by all the ecclesiastics of every degree who 
were present at the council, nor by all the absent bishops of the West, 
who, expressly or tacitly, might adhere to its decrees. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 709 

which had sunk much deeper into the minds of men; and in the ses- 
sions of Ferrara and Florence the Latin addition of filioque was sub- 
divided into two questions, whether it were legal, and whether it were 
orthodox. Perhaps it may not be necessary to boast on this subject 
of my own impartial indifference: but I must think that the Greeks 
were strongly supported by the prohibition of the council of Chalcedon 
against adding any article whatsoever to the creed of Nice, or rather 
of Constantinople. 03 In earthly affairs it is not easy to conceive how 
an assembly of legislators can bind their successors invested with 
powers equal to their own. But the dictates of inspiration must be 
true and unchangeable; nor should a private bishop or a provincial 
synod have presumed to innovate against the judgment of the Catholic 
church. On the substance of the doctrine the controversy was equal 
and endless; reason is confounded by the procession of a deity; the 
Gospel, which lay on the altar, was silent; the various texts of the 
fathers might be corrupted by fraud or entangled by sophistry; and 
the Greeks were ignorant of the characters and writings of the Latin 
saints. 64 Of this at least we may be sure, that neither side could be 
convinced by the arguments of their opponents. Prejudice may be 
enlightened by reason, and a superficial glance may be rectified by a 
clear and more perfect view of an object adapted to our faculties. But 
the bishops and monks had been taught from their infancy to repeat a 
form of mysterious words: their national and personal honour depended 
on the repetition of the same sounds, and their narrow minds were 
hardened and inflamed by the acrimony of a public dispute. 

While they were lost in a cloud of dust and darkness, the pope and 
emperor were desirous of a seeming union, which could alone accom- 
plish the purposes of their interview; and the obstinacy of public dis- 
pute was softened by the arts of private and personal negotiation. Tbfl 
patriarch Joseph had sunk under the weight of age and infirmities; 
his dying voice breathed the counsels of charity and concord, and his 
vacant benefice might tempt the hopes of the ambitious clergy. The 
ready and active obedience of the archbishops of Russia and Nice, of 
Isidore and Bessarion, was prompted and recompensed by their speedy 
promotion to the dignity of cardinals. Bessarion, in the first debates, 
had stood forth the most strenuous and eloquent champion of the Greek 
church; and if the apostate, the bastard, was reprobated, by his coun- 
try, 65 he appears in ecclesiastical story a rare example of a patriot who 

"The Greeks, who disliked the union, were unwilling to sally from this 
strong fortress (p. 178, 193, IQS. 202, of Syropulus). The shame of the 
Latins was aggravated by their producing an old MS. of the. second council 
of Nice, with filioque in the Nicene creed. A palpable forgery 1 (p. 173).

was recommended to court favour by loud opposition and well-timed 
compliance. With the aid of his two spiritual coadjutors, the emperor 
applied his arguments to the general situation and personal characters 
of the bishops, and each was successively moved by authority and ex- 
ample. Their revenues were in the hands of the Turks, their persons 
in those of the Latins; an episcopal treasure, three robes and forty 
ducats, was soon exhausted; 00 the hopes of their return still depended 
on the ships of Venice and the alms of Rome; and such was their in- 
digence, that their arrears, the payment of a debt, would be accepted 
as a favour, and might operate as a, bribe. 07 The danger and relief of 
Constantinople might excuse some prudent and pious dissimulation; 
and it was insinuated that the obstinate heretics who should resist the 
consent of the East and West would be abandoned in a hostile land to 
the revenge or justice of the Roman pontiff. 68 In the first private as- 
sembly of the Greeks the formulary of union was approved by twenty- 
four, and rejected by twelve, members; but the five crossbeams of St. 
Sophia, who aspired to represent the patriarch, were disqualified by 
ancient cliscipline, and their right of voting was transferred to an ob- 
sequious train of monks, grammarians, and profane laymen. The will 
of the monarch produced a false and servile unanimity, and no more 
.than two patriots hac} courage to speak their own sentiments and those 
of their country. Demetrius, the emperor's brother, retired to- Venice, 
that he might not be witness of the union; and Mark of Ephesus, mis- 
taking, perhaps hfe pride for his conscience, disclaimed all communion 
with the Latin heretics, and avowed himself the champion and con- 
fessor of the orthodox creed. 60 In the treaty between the two nations 
several forms of consent were proposed, such as might satisfy the 
.Latins without dishonouring the Greeks; and they weighed the scru- 
ples of words and syllables till the theological balance trembled with 
a .slight preponderance in favour of the Vatican. It was agreed (I 
must entreat the attention of the reader) that the Holy Ghost pro- 
ceeds from the Father and the Son, as from one principle and one sub-

Bucas (c. 31 [p. 216, ed Bonn]). One had possessed, for his whole property, 
three o!4 gownsi etci By teaching ,one-and-twenty years in his monastery, 
Bessarion himself had collected forty gold florins; but of these the arch- 
bishop had expended twenty-eight in his voyage from Peloponnesus, and 
the remainder at Constantinople (Syropulus, p. 127). 

67 Syropulus denies that the Greeks received any money before they had 
subscribed the act of union (p. 283) : yet he relates some suspicious cir- 
cumstances; and their bribery and corruption are positively affirmed by 
the historian Ducas [loc. cit.]. 

*The Greeks, most piteously express their own fears of exile and per-

emperor's threats (p. 260).

who usually lay quiet on tie. foot-cloth of the emperor's throne, but who

p. 265, 266)

stance; that he proceeds by the Son, being of the same nature and 
substance; and that he proceeds from the Father and the Son, bygone 
spiration and production. It is less difficult to understand the articles 
of the preliminary treaty: that the pope should defray all the expenses 
of the Greeks in their return home; that he should annually maintain 
two galleys and three hundred soldiers for the defence of Constanti- 
nople; that all the ships which transported pilgrims to Jerusalem should 
be obliged to touch at that port; that as often as they were required, 
the pope should furnish ten galleys for a year, or twenty for six 
months; and that he should powerfully solicit the princes of Europe, 
if the emperor had occasion for land-forces. 

The same year, and almost the same day, were marked by the depo- 
sition of Eugenius at Basil, and, at Florence, by his reunion of the 
Greeks and Latins. In the former synod (which he styled indeed an 
assembly of demons) the pope was branded with the guilt of simony, 
perjury, tyranny, heresy, and schism; 70 and declared to be incorrigible 
in his vices, unworthy of any title, and incapable of holding any ecclesi- 
astical office. In the latter he was revered as the true and holy vicar 
of Christ, who, after a separation of six hundred years, had reconciled 
the Catholics of the East and West in one fold, and under one shep- 
herd. The act of union was subscribed by the pope, the emperor, and 
the principal members of both churches; even by those who, like Syrop- 
ulus, 71 had been deprived of the right of voting. Two copies might 
have sufficed for the East and West; but Eugenius was not satisfied 
unless four authentic and similar transcripts were signed and attested 
as the monuments of his victory. 72 On a memorable day, the sixth ot 
July, the successors of St. Peter and Constantine ascended their 
thrones; the two nations assembled in the cathedral of Florence; their 
representatives, Cardinal Julian, and Bessarion archbishop of Nice, 
appeared in the pulpit, and, after reading in their respective tongues 
the act of union, they mutually embraced in the name and the presence 
of their applauding brethren. The pope and his ministers then offi- 
ciated according to the Roman liturgy; the creed was chanted with the 
addition of filioque; the acquiescence of the Greeks was poorly excused 

70 From the original Lives of the Popes, in Muratori's Collection (torn. iii. 
P. ii. torn, xxv.), the manners of Eugenius IV. appear to have been decent, 
and even exemplary. His situation, exposed to the world and to his enemies, 
was a restraint, and is a pledge. 

n Syropulus, rather than subscribe, would have assisted, as the least evil, 
at the ceremony of the union. He was compelled to do both; and the 
great ecclesiarch poorly excuses his submission to the emperor (p. 290-292). 

"None of these original acts of union can at present be produced. Of 
the ten MSS. that are preserved (five at Rome, and the remainder at 
Florence, Bologna, Venice, Paris, and London), nine have been examined 
by an accurate critic (M. de Brequigny), who condemns them for the 
variety and imperfections of the Greek signatures. Yet several of these 
may be esteemed as authentic copies, which were subscribed at Florence, 
before (26th of August, 1439) the final separation of the pope and emperor 
(M^moires de 1* Academic des Inscriptions, torn, xliii. p. 287-311).

by their ignorance of the harmonious but inarticulate sounds; 73 and the 

more scrupulous Latins refused any public celebration of the Byzantine 

rite. Yet the emperor and his clergy were not totally unmindful of na- 

tional honour. The treaty was ratified by their consent: it was tacitly 

agreed that no innovation should be attempted in their creed or cere- 

monies; they spared and secretly respected the generous firmness of 

Mark of Ephesus, and, on the decease of the patriarch, they refused to 

elect his successor, except in the cathedral of St. Sophia. In the distri- 

bution of public and private rewards the liberal pontiff exceeded their 

hopes and his promises: the Greeks, with less pomp and pride, returned 

by the same road of Ferrara and Venice; and their reception at Con- 

stantinople was such as will be described in the following chapter. 74 

The success of the first trial encouraged Eugenius to repeat the same 

edifying scenes, and the deputies of the Armenians, the Maronites, the 

Jacobites of Syria and Egypt, the Nestorians, and the Ethiopians, were 

successively introduced to kiss the feet of the Roman pontiff, and to 

announce the obedience and the orthodoxy of the East. These Orien- 

tal embassies, unknown in the countries which they presumed to rep- 

resent, 76 diffused over the West the fame of Eugenius; and a clamour 

was artfully propagated against the remnant of a schism in Switzerland 

and Savoy which alone impeded the harmony of the Christian world. 

The vigour of opposition was succeeded by the lassitude of despair; 

the council of Basil was silently dissolved; and Felix, renouncing the 

tiara, again withdrew to the devout or delicious hermitage of Ripaille. 

A general peace was secured by mutual acts of oblivion and indemnity: 

all ideas of reformation subsided; the popes continued to exercise and 

abuse their ecclesiastical despotism; nor has Rome been since dis- 

turbed by the mischiefs of a contested election. 77 

The journeys of three emperors were unavailing for their temporal,

M In their return the Greeks conversed at Bologna with the ambassadors 
of England; and after some questions and answers these impartial strangers 
laughed at the pretended union of Florence (Syropul. p. 307).

Jacobites, etc., that I have turned over, without success, the Bibliotheca 
Orientalis of Assemannus, a faithful slave of the Vatican.

lake of Geneva. It is now a Carthusian abbey; and Mr. Addison (Travels

celebrated the place and the founder. -^Eneas Sylvius, and the fathers of

or perhaps their spiritual, salvation; but they were productive of a 
beneficial consequence, the revival of the Greek learning in Italy, from 
whence it was propagated to the last nations of the West and North. 
In their lowest servitude and depression, the subjects of the Byzantine 
throne were still possessed of a golden key that could unlock the treas- 
ures of antiquity, of a musical and prolific language that gives a soul 
to the objects of sense, and a body to the abstractions of philosophy. 
Since the barriers of the -monarchy, and even of the capital, had been 
trampled under foot, the various barbarians had doubtless corrupted 
the form and substance of the national dialect; and ample glossaries 
have been composed, to interpret a multitude of words, of Arabic, Turk- 
ish, Sdavonian, Latin, or French origin. 78 But a purer idiom was 
spoken in the court and taught hi the college, and the flourishing state 
of the language is described, and perhaps embellished, by a learned 
Italian, 79 who, by a long residence and noble marriage, 80 was natural- 
ised at Constantinople about thirty years before the Turkish conquest. 
" The vulgar speech," says Philephus, 81 " has been depraved by the 
people, and infected by the multitude of strangers and merchants, who 
every day flock to the city and mingle with the inhabitants. It is from 
the disciples of such a school that the Latin language received the ver- 
sions of Aristotle and Plato, so obscure in sense, and in spirit so poor. 
But the Greeks, who have escaped the contagion, are those whom we 
follow, and they alone are worthy of our imitation. In familiar dis- 
course they still speak the tongue of Aristophanes and Euripides, of 
the historians and philosophers of Athens; and the style of their writ- 

* ln^ the^ first attempt Meursius collected 3600 Graeco-barbarous words, 
to which, in a second edition he subjoined 1800 more; yet what plenteous 
gleanings did he leave to Portius, Ducange, Fabrotti, the Bollandists, etc.! 
(Fabric. Biblioth. Grace, torn. x. p. 101, etc.) Some Persic words may be 
found in Xenophon, and some Latin ones in Plutarch; and such is the in- 
evitable effect of war and commerce; but the form and substance of the 
language were not affected by this slight alloy. 

"The life of Francis Philelphus, a sophist, proud, restless, and rapacious, 
has been diligently composed by Lancelot (Memoires de 1' Academic de5 
Inscriptions, torn. x. p. 691-751) and Tiraboschi (Istoria della Letteratura 
Itahana, tonu yii. p. 282-294), for the most part from his own letters. His 
elaborate writings, and those of his contemporaries, are forgotten: but 
their familiar epistles still describe the men and the times. 

*He married, and had perhaps debauched, the daughter of John, and 
the granddaughter of Manuel Chrysoloras. She was young, beautiful, and 
wealthy; and her noble family was allied to the Dorias of Genoa and the 
emperors^ of Constantinople.

ings is still more elaborate and correct. The persons who, by their 
birth and offices, are attached to the Byzantine court, are those who 
maintain, with the least alloy, the ancient standard of elegance and 
purity; and the native graces of language most conspicuously shine 
among the noble matrons, who are excluded from all intercourse with 
foreigners. With foreigners do I say? They live retired and seques- 
tered from the eyes of their fellow-citizens. Seldom are they seen in 
the streets; and when they leave their houses, it is in the dusk of 
evening, on visits to the churches and their nearest kindred. On these 
occasions they are on horseback, covered with a veil, and encompassed 
by their parents, their husbands, or their servants. 82 

Among the Greeks a numerous and opulent clergy was dedicated to 
the service of religion; their monks and bishops have ever been dis- 
tinguished by the gravity and austerity of their manners, nor were they 
diverted, like the Latin priests, by the pursuits and pleasures of a secu- 
lar and even military life. After a large deduction for the time and 
talents that were lost in the devotion, the laziness, and the discord of 
the church and cloister, the more inquisitive and ambitious minds would 
explore the sacred and profane erudition of their native language. The 
ecclesiastics presided ov?r the education of youth: the schools of phi- 
losophy and eloquence were perpetuated till the fall of the empire; -and 
it may be affirmed that more books and more knowledge were included 
within the walls of Constantinople than could be dispersed over the 
extensive countries of the West. 83 But an important distinction has 
been already noticed: the Greeks Were stationary or retrograde, while 
the Latins were advancing with a rapid and progressive motion. The 
pations were ezcited by the spirit of independence and emulation; and 
even the little world of the Italian states contained more people and 
industry than the decreasing circle of the Byzantine empire. In Eu- 
rope the lower ranks of society were relieved from the yoke of feudal 
servitude; and freedom is the first step to curiosity and knowledge. 
The use, however rude and corrupt, of the Latin tongue had been pre- 
served by superstition; the universities, from Bologna to Oxford, 84 , were 
peopled with thousands of scholars; and their misguided ardour" might

from the manners of ancient Rome* 

88 See the state of learning in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries in 
the learned and judicious Mosheim (Institut. Hist. Eccles. p. 434-440, 490-494). 

"At the end of the fifteenth century there existed in Europe about fifty 
universities, and of these the foundation of ten or twelve is prior to the 
year 1300. They were crowded in proportion to their scarcity. Bologna 
contained 10,000 students, chiefly of the civil law. In the year 1357 the 
number at Oxford had decreased from 30,000 to 6000 scholars (Henry's 
History of .Great Britain, vol. iv. p. 478). Yet even this decrease is much 
superior- to the present list of the members of the university. 

[Rashdall,,{n his Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages, says that the 
maximum number of students at Oxford in the fourteenth century was 
from 1500 to 3000. By 1438 they had fallen to 1000. He thinks it unlikely 
that the numbers at Paris and Bologna exceeded 6000 or 7000. O. S.] 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 7*5 

be directed to more liberal and manly studies. In the resurrection of 
science Italy was the first that cast away her shroud; and the eloquent 
Petrarch, by his lessons and his example, may justly be applauded a? 
the first harbinger of day. A purer style of composition, a more gen- 
erous and rational strain of sentiment, flowed from the study and imi- 
tation of the writers of ancient Rome; and the disciples of Cicero and 
Virgil approached, with reverence and love, the sanctuary of their Gre- 
cian masters. In the sack of Constantinople, the French, and even the 
Venetians, had despised and destroyed the works of Lysippus and Ho- 
mer; the monuments of art may be annihilated by a single blow, but 
the immortal mind is renewed and multiplied by the copies of the pen, 
and such copies it was the ambition of Petrarch and his friends to pos- 
sess and understand. The arms of the Turks undoubtedly pressed the 
flight of the Muses: yet we may tremble at the thought that Greece 
might have been overwhelmed, with her schools and libraries, before 
Europe had emerged from the deluge of barbarism; that the seeds of 
science might have been scattered by the winds before the Italian soil 
was prepared for their cultivation. 

The most learned Italians of the fifteenth century have confessed 
and applauded the restoration of Greek literature, after a long oblivion 
of many hundred years. 85 Yet in that country, and beyond the Alps, 
some names are quoted; some profound scholars who, in the darkei 
ages, were honourably distinguished by their knowledge of the Greek 
tongue; and national vanity has been loud hi the praise of such rare 
examples of erudition. Without scrutinising the merit of individuals, 
truth must observe that their science is without a cause and without an 
effect; that it was easy for them to satisfy themselves and their more 
ignorant contemporaries; and that the idiom, which they had so mar- 
vellously acquired, was transcribed in few manuscripts, and was not 
taught in any university of the West. In a corner of Italy it faintly 
existed as the popular, or at least as the ecclesiastical, dialect. 80 The 
first impression of the Doric and Ionic colonies has never been com- 
pletely erased; the Calabrian churches were long attached to the 
throne of Constantinople; and the monks of St. Basil pursued their 
studies in Mount Athos and the schools of the East. Calabria was the 
native country of Barlaam, -who has already appeared as a sectary and 
an ambassador; and Barlaam was the first who revived, beyond, the

learning in Italy, the two principal are Hodius, Dr. Humphrey Hody (de

Londini, 1742, in large octavo), and Tiraboschi (Istoria della Letteratura 
Italiana, torn. v. p. 364-377* torn. vii. p. 112-143). The Oxford professor is 
a laborious scholar, but the librarian of Modena enjoys the superiority of 
a modern an ^national historian. 

"In Calabria quae olim Magna Graecia dicebatur, coloniis Graecis repleta, 
remansit quaedam linguae veteris 'cognitio (Hodius, p.. 2). If it were eradi- 
cated by the Romans, it was revived and perpetuated by the monks of St. 
Basil, who possessed seven convents at Rossano alone (Giannone, Istoria

Alps, the memory, or at least the writings, of Homer. 87 He is de- 
scribed, by Petrarch and Boccace, 88 as a man of a diminutive stature, 
though truly great in the measure of learning and genius: of a piercing 
discernment, though of a slow and painful elocution. For many ages 
(as they affirm) Greece had not produced his equal in the knowledge 
of history, grammar, and philosophy; and his merit was celebrated in 
the attestations of the princes and doctors of Constantinople. One of 
these attestations is still extant; and the emperor Cantacuzene, the 
protector of his adversaries, is forced to allow that Euclid, Aristotle, 
and Plato were familiar to that profound and subtle logician. 89 In the 
court of Avignon he formed an intimate connection with Petrarch 90 
the first of the Latin scholars; and the desire of mutual instruction was 
the principle of their literary commerce. The Tuscan applied himself 
with eager curiosity and assiduous diligence to the study of the Greek 
language, and in a laborious strugle with the dryness and difficulty of 
the first rudiments he began to reach the sense, and to feel the spirit, 
of poets and philosophers whose minds were congenial to his own. But 
he was soon deprived of the society and lessons of this useful assist- 
ant; Barlaam relinquished his fruitless embassy, and, on his return to 
Greece, he rashly provoked the swarms of fanatic monks, by attempt- 
ing to substitute the light of reason to that of their navel. After a 
separation of three years the two friends again met in the court of 
Naples; but the' generous pupil renounced the fairest occasion of im- 
provement; and by his recommendation Barlaam was finally settled in 
a small bishopric of his native Calabria. 01 The manifold avocations of 
Petrarch, love and friendship, his various correspondence and frequent 
journeys, the Roman laurel, and his elaborate compositions in prose 
and verse, in Latin and Italian, diverted him from a foreign idiom; 
and as he advanced in life the attainment of the Greek language was 
the object of his wishes rather than of his hopes. When he was about 
fifty years of age, a Byzantine ambassador, his friend, and a master of 
both tongues, presented him with a copy of Homer, and the answer of 
Petrarch is at once expressive of his eloquence, gratitude, and regret. 
After celebrating the generosity of the donor, and tjie value of a gift 
more precious in his estimation than gold or rubies, he thus proceeds: 
" Your present of the genuine and original text of the divine poet, the 

8T Ii Barbari (says Petrarch, the French and Germans) vix, non dicam 
libros sed nomen Homed audiverunt. Perhaps in that respect the thirteenth 
century was less happy than the age of Charlemagne.

fountain of all invention, is worthy of yourself and of me; you have 
fulfilled your promise, and satisfied my desires. Yet your liberality 
is still imperfect: with Homer you should have given me yourself; a 
guide who could lead me into the fields of light, and disclose to my 
wondering eyes the specious miracles of the Iliad and Odyssey. But, 
alas! Homer is dumb, or I am deaf; nor is it in my power to enjoy 
the beauty which I possess. I have seated him by the side of Plato, 
the prince of poets near the prince of philosophers, and I glory in the 
sight of my illustrious guests. Of their immortal writings, whatever 
had been translated into the Latin idiom I had already acquired; but 
if there be no profit, there is some pleasure, in beholding these vener- 
able Greeks in their proper and national habit. I am delighted with 
the aspect of Homer; and as often as I embrace the silent volume, I 
exclaim with a sigh, Illustrious bard! with what pleasure should I 
listen to thy song, if my sense of hearing were not obstructed and lost 
by the death of one friend, and in the much lamented absence of 
another! Nor do I yet despair, and the example of Cato suggests some 
comfort and hope, since it was in the last period of age that he attained 
the knowledge of the Greek letters." 2 

The prize which eluded the efforts of Petrarch was obtained by the 
fortune and industry of his friend Boccace, 83 the father of the Tuscan 
prose. That particular writer, who derives his reputation from the 
Decameron, a hundred novels of pleasantry and love, may aspire to the 
more serious praise of restoring in Italy the study of die Greek lan- 
guage. In the year one thousand three hundred and sixty a disciple 
of Barlaam, whose name was Leo or Leontius Pilatus, was detained in 
his way to Avignon by the advice and hospitality of Boccace, who 
lodged the stranger in his house, prevailed on the republic of Florence 
to allow him an annual stipend, and devoted his leisure to the first 
Greek professor, who taught that language in the Western countries of 
Europe. The appearance of Leo might disgust the most eager disciple: 
he was clothed in the mantle of a philosopher or a mendicant; his 
countenance was hideous; his face was overshadowed with black hair; 
his beard long and uncombed; his deportment rustic; his temper 
gloomy and inconstant; nor could he grace his discourse with the or- 
naments or even the perspicuity of Latin elocution. But his mind was 
stored with a treasure of Greek learning: history and fable, philosophy 

"I will transcribe a passage from this epistle of Petrarch (Famil. ix. 2) : 
Donasti Homerum non in alienum sermonem violento alveo derivatum, 
sed ex ipsis Graeci eloquii scatebris, et qualis divino illi profluxit ingenio. . . . 
Sine tua voce Homerus tuus apud me mutus, immo yero ego apud ilium 
surdus sum. Gaudeo tamen vel adspectu solo, ac saepe ilium amplexus atque 
suspirans dicp, O magne vir, etc. 

" For the life and writings of Boccace, who was born in 1313, and died in 
1375, Fabricius (Biblioth. Latin, medii JEvi, torn. i. p. 248, etc.) and Tira- 
boschi (torn. v. p. 83, 439-451) may be consulted. The editions, versions, 
imitations of his novels, are innumerable. Yet he was ashamed to com- 
municate that trifling, and perhaps scandalous, work to Petrarch, his re- 
spectable friend, in whose letters and memoirs he conspicuously appears. 



7i8 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

and grammar, were alike at his command; and he read the poems of 
Homer in the schools of Florence. It was from his explanation that 
Boccace composed and transcribed a literal prose version of the Iliad 
and Odyssey, which satisfied the thirst of his friend Petrarch, and 
which, perhaps in the succeeding century, was clandestinely used by 
Laurentius Valla, the Latin interpreter. It was from his narratives 
that the same Boccace collected the materials for his treatise on the 
genealogy of the heathen gods, a work, in that age, of stupendous eru- 
dition, and which he ostentatiously sprinkled with Greek characters 
and passages, to excite the wonder and applause of his more ignorant 
readers. 04 The first steps of learning are slow and laborious; no more 
than ten votaries of Homer could be enumerated in all Italy, and 
neither Rome, nor Venice, nor Naples, could add a single name to this 
studious catalogue. But their numbers would have multiplied, their 
progress would have been accelerated, if the inconstant Leo, at the 
end of three years, had not relinquished an honourable and beneficial 
station. In his passage Petrarch entertained him at Padua a short 
time: he enjoyed the scholar, but was justly offended with the gloomy 
and unsocial temper of the man. Discontented with the world and 
with himself, Leo depreciated his present enjoyments, while absent per^ 
sons and objects were dear to his imagination. In Italy he was a Thes- 
salian, in Greece a native of Calabria; in the company of the Latins he 
disdained their language, religion, and manners: no sooner was he 
landed at Constantinople than he again sighed for the wealth of Venice 
and the elegance of Florence. His Italian friends were deaf to his im- 
portunity: he depended on their curiosity and indulgence, and em- 
barked on a second voyage; but on his entrance into the Adriatic the 
ship was assailed by a tempest, and the unfortunate teacher, who like 
Ulysses had fastened himself to the mast, was struck dead by a flash 
of lightning. The humane Petrarch dropped a tear on his disaster; 
but he was most anxious to learn whether some copy of Euripides or 
Sophocles might not be saved from the hands of the mariners. 05 

But the faint rudiments of Greek learning, which Petrarch had en-^ 
couraged and Boccace had planted, soon withered and expired. TJie 
succeeding generation was content for a while with the improvement 
of Latin eloquence; nor was it before the end of the fourteenth cen- 
tury that a new and perpetual flame was rekindled in Italy. 06 Previous

to his own journey, the emperor Manuel despatched his envoys and 
orators to implore the compassion of the Western princes. Of these 
envoys the most conspicuous, or the most learned, was Manuel Chryso- 
loras, 07 of noble birth, and whose Roman ancestors are supposed to 
have migrated with the great Constantine. After visiting the courts of 
France and England, where he obtained some contributions and more 
promises, the envoy was invited to assume the office of a professor; 
and Florence had again the honour of this second invitation. By his 
knowledge, not only of the Greek but of the Latin tongue, Chrysoloras 
deserved tie stipend and surpassed the expectation of the republic. 
His school was frequented by a crowd of disciples of every rank and 
age; and one of these, in a general history, has described his motives 
and his success. " At that time," says Leonard Aretin, 08 " I was a 
student of the civil law; but my soul was inflamed with the love of let- 
ters, and I bestowed some application on the sciences of logic and 
rhetoric. On the arrival of Manuel I hesitated whether I should de- 
sert my legal studies or relinquish this golden opportunity; and thus, 
in the ardour of youth, I communed with my own mind Wilt thou be 
wanting to thyself and thy fortune? Wilt thou refuse to be introduced 
to a familiar converse with Homer, Plato, and Demosthenes? with those 
poets, philosophers, and orators, of whom such wonders are related, 
and who are celebrated by every age as the great masters of human 
science? Of professors, and scholars in civil law, a sufficient supply 
will always be found in our universities; but a teacher, and such a 
teacher of the Greek language, if he once be suffered to escape, may 
never afterwards be retrieved. Convinced by these reasons, I gave 
myself to Chrysoloras, and so strong was my passion, that the lessons 
which I had imbibed in the day were the constant subject of my 
nightly dreams." 9!) At the same time and place the Latin classics were 
explained by John of Ravenna, the domestic pupil of Petrarch: 100 the 
Italians, who illustrated their age and country, were formed in this 

and the presence of the Greek magistrates and troops at Ravenna and Rome 
must have preserved, in some degree, the use of their native tongue. - 

** See the article of Emanuel, or Manuel Chrysoloras, in Hody (p. 12-54) 
and Tiraboschi (torn. vii. p. 113-118). The precise date of his arrival 
floats between the years 1390 and 1400, and is only confined by the reign 
of Boniface IX. 

w The name of Aretinus has been assumed by five or six natives of Aresso 
in Tuscany, of whom the mt&gt;st famous and the most worthless lived in the 
sixteenth century. Leonardus Brunus Aretinus, the disciple of Chrysoloras, 
was a linguist, an orator, and an historian, the secretary of four successive 
popes, and the chancellor of the republic of Florence, where he died A.D. 1444, 
at the age of seventy-five (Fabric. Biblioth. medii JEvi, torn. i. p. 190, etc.; 
Tiraboschi, torn. vii. p. 33-38).

plains of the eager curiosity, restless temper, and proud feelings, which 
announce the genius and glory of a riper age (M&amp;noires sur Petrarque

double school, and Florence became the fruitful seminary of Greek 
and Roman erudition. 101 The presence of the emperor recalled Chryso- 
loras from the college to the court; but he afterwards taught at Pavia 
and Rome with equal industry and applause. The remainder of his 
life, about fifteen years, was divided between Italy and Constantinople, 
between embassies and lessons. In the noble office of enlightening a 
foreign nation, the grammarian was not unmindful of a more sacred 
duty to his prince and country; and Emanuel Chrysoloras died at Con- 
stance on a public mission from the emperor to the council. 

After his example, the restoration of the Greek letters in Italy was 
prosecuted by a series of emigrants, who were destitute of fortune and 
endowed with learning, or at least with language. From the terror or 
oppression of the Turkish arms, the natives of Thessalonica and Con- 
stantinople escaped to a land of freedom, curiosity, and wealth. The 
synod introduced into Florence the lights of the Greek church and the 
oracles of the Platonic philosophy; and the fugitives who adhered to 
the union had the double merit of renouncing their country, not only 
for the Christian but for the Catholic cause. A patriot, who sacrifices 
his party and conscience to the allurements of favour, may be pos- 
sessed however of the private and social virtues: he no longer hears 
the reproachful epithets of slave and apostate, and the consideration 
which he acquires among his new associates will restore in his own eyes 
the dignity of his character. The prudent conformity of Bessarion 
was rewarded with the Roman purple: he fixed his residence in Italy, 
and the Greek cardinal, the titular patriarch of Constantinople, was 
respected as the chief and protector of his nation: 102 his abilities were 
exercised in the legations of Bologna, Venice, Germany, and France; 
and his election to the chair of St. Peter floated for a moment on the 
uncertain breath of a conclave. 103 His ecclesiastical honours diffused 
a splendour and pre-eminence over his literary merit and service: his 
palace was a school; as often as the cardinal visited the Vatican he 
Was attended by a learned train of both nations; 104 of men applauded

Vergerius, Omnibonus Vincentius, Poggius, Franciscus Barbaras, etc. But 
I question whether a rigid chronology would allow Chrysoloras all these 
eminent scholars (Hodius, p. 25-27, etc.). 

101 See in Hody the article of Bessarion (p. 136-177). Theodore Gaza, 
George of Trebizond, and the rest of the Greeks whom I have named or 
omitted, are inserted in their proper chapters of his learned work. See like- 
wise Tiraboschi, in the first and second parts of the sixth tome.

by themselves and the public, and whose writings, now overspread 
with dust, were popular and useful in their own times. I shall not 
attempt to enumerate the restorers of Grecian literature in the fifteenth 
century; and it may be sufficient to mention with gratitude the names 
of Theodore Gaza, of George of Trebizond, of John Argyropulus, and 
Demetrius Chalcocondyles, who taught their native language in the 
schools of Florence and Rome. Their labours were not inferior to those 
of Bessarion, whose purple they revered, and whose fortune was the 
secret object of their envy. But the lives of these grammarians were 
humble and obscure: they had declined the lucrative paths of the 
church; their dress and manners secluded them from the commerce of 
the world; and since they were confined to the merit, they might be 
content with the rewards of learning. From this character Janus Las- 
caris 105 will deserve an exception. His eloquence, politeness, and Im- 
perial descent, recommended him to the French monarchs; and in the 
same cities he was alternately employed to teach and to negotiate. 
Duty and interest prompted them to cultivate the study of the Latin 
language, and the most successful attained the faculty of writing and 
speaking with fluency and elegance in a foreign idiom. But they ever 
retained the inveterate vanity of their country: their praise, or at least 
their esteem, was reserved for the national writers to whom they owed 
their fame and subsistence; and they sometimes betrayed their con- 
tempt in licentious criticism or satire on Virgil's poetry and the oratory 
of Tully. 10 * The superiority of these masters arose from the familiar 
use of a living language; and their first disciples were incapable of dis- 
cerning how far they had degenerated from the knowledge and even 
the practice of their ancestors. A vicious pronunciation, 107 which they

105 He was born before the taking of Constantinople, but his honourable 
life was stretched far into the sixteenth century (A.D. 1535). Lea X. and 
Francis I. were his noblest patrons, under whose auspices he founded the 
Greek colleges of Rome and Paris (Hody, p. 247-275). He left posterity 
in France ; -but the counts de Vintimille, and their numerous branches, derive 
the name of Lascaris from a doubtful marriage in the thirteenth century 
with the daughter of a Greek emperor (Ducange, Fam. Byzant p. 224-230). 

106 Two of his epigrams against Virgil, and three against Tully, are pre- 
served and refuted by Franciscus Floridus, who can find no better names 
than Graeculus ineptus et impudens (Hody, p. 274). In our own times an 
English critic has accused the JEneid of containing multa languida, nuga- 
toria, spiritii et maj estate carminis heroici defecta; many such verses as 
he, the said Jeremiah Markland, would have been ashamed of owning 
(praefat. ad. Statii Sylvas, p. 21, 22). 

107 Manuel Chrysoloras and his colleagues are accused of ignorance, envy, 
or avarice (Sylloge, etc., torn. ii. p. 235). The modern Greeks pronounce 
the p as a V consonant, and confound three vowels (^ i v) and several 
diphthongs. Such was the vulgar pronunciation which the stern Gardiner 
maintained by penal statutes in the university of Cambridge; but the 
monosyllable fa represented to an Attic ear the bleating of sheep, and a 
bellwether is better evidence than a bishop or a chancellor. The treatises

introduced, was banished from the schools by the reason of the suc- 
ceeding age. Of the power of the Greek accents they were ignorant; 
and those musical notes, which, from an Attic tongue and to an Attic 
ear, must have been the secret soul of harmony, were to their eyes, as 
to our own, no more than mute and unmeaning marks, in prose super- 
fluous and troublesome in verse. The art of grammar they truly pos- 
sessed; the valuable fragments of Apollonius and Herodian were trans- 
fused into, their lessons; and their treatises of syntax and etymology, 
though devoid of philosophic spirit, are still useful to the Greek stu- 
dent. In the shipwreck of the Byzantine libraries each fugitive seized 
a fragment of treasure, a copy of some author, who, without his indus- 
try, might have perished: the transcripts were multiplied by an assidu- 
ous and sometimes an elegant pen, and the text was corrected and ex- 
plained by their own comments or those of the elder scholiasts. The 
sense, though not the spirit, of the Greek classics was interpreted to 
the Latin world: the beauties of style evaporate in a version; but the 
judgment of Theodore Gaza selected the more solid works of Aristotle 
and Theophrastus, and their natural histories of animals and plants 
opened a rich fund of genuine and experimental science. 

Yet the fleeting shadows of metaphysics were pursued with more 
curiosity and ardour. After a long oblivion, Plato was revived in Italy 
by a venerable Greek, 108 who taught in the house of Cosmo of Medicis. 
While the synod of Florence was involved in theological debate, some 
beneficial consequences might flow from the study of his elegant phi- 
losophy: his style is the purest standard of the Attic dialect, and his 
sublime thoughts are sometimes adapted to familiar conversation, and 
sometimes adorned with the richest colours of poetry and eloquence. 
The dialogues of Plato are a dramatic picture of the life and death of 
a sage; and, as often as he descends from the clouds, his moral system 
inculcates the love of truth, of our country, and of mankind. The pre- 
cept and example of Socrates recommended a modest doubt and liberal 
inquiry; and if the Platonists, with blind devotion, adored the visions 
and errors of their divine master, their enthusiasm might correct the 
dry, dogmatic method of the Peripatetic school. So equal, yet so oppo- 
site, are the merits of Plato and Aristotle, that they may be balanced 
in endless controversy; but some spark of freedom may be produced by 
the collision of adverse servitude. The modern Greeks were divided 

of those scholars, particularly Erasmus, who asserted a more classical 
pronunciation, are collected in the Sylloge of Havercamp (2 yols. in octavo, 
Lugd. Bat. '1734 1740); but it is difficult to paint sounds by words,; and, 
in their reference to modern use, they can be understood only by their 
respective countrymen. We may observe that our peculiar pronunciation 
of the 6, th, is approved by Erasmus (torn. ii. p. 130).

between the two sects: with more fury than skill they fought under the 
banner of their leaders, and the field of battle was removed in their 
flight from Constantinople to Rome. But this philosophical debate 
soon degenerated into an angry and personal quarrel of grammarians; 
and Bessarion, though an advocate for Plato, protected the national 
honour by interposing the advice and authority of a mediator. In the 
gardens of the Medici the academical doctrine was enjoyed by the po- 
lite and learned; but their philosophic society was quickly dissolved; 
and if the writings of the Attic sage were perused in the closet, the more 
powerful Stagyrite continued to reign the oracle of the church and 
school. 100 

I have fairly represented "the literary merits of the Greeks; yet it 
must be confessed that they were seconded and surpassed by the ardour 
of the Latins. Italy was divided into many independent states; and 
at that time it was the ambition of princes and republics to vie with 
each other in the encouragement and reward of literature. The fame 
of Nicholas 1 the Fifth 110 has not been adequate to his merits. From 
a plebeian origin he raised himself by his virtue and' learning: the char- 
acter of .the man, prevailed over the interest of the pope, and he sharp- 
ened those weapons which r were soon pointed against the Roman 
church. 111 He h^d been the friend of the most eminent scholars of the 
age: he became their patron; and such was the humility of his manners, 
that the change was scarcely discernible either to them or to himself. 
If he pressed the acceptance of a liberal gift, it was not as the measure 
of desert,' but as the proof of benevolence; and when modest merit de- 
cliiled his bounty, " Accept it," would he say, with a consciousness of 
his own worth: " you will not always have a. Nicholas among ye." The 
influence of the hoi, see pervaded Christendom; arid he everted that 
influence in the search, not of benefices, but of books. From the ruins 
of the Byzantine libraries, from the darkest monasteries of Germany 
and Britain, he collected the, dusty manuscripts of the writers of an- 
tiquity; .and wherever the original could not be removed, a faithful 
copy was transcribed and transmitted for his use. The Vatican, the 
old repository for bulls and legends, for superstition and forgery, was 
daily replenished with more precious furniture; and such was the in- 
dustry of Nicholas, that in a reign of eight years he formed a library

of five thousand volumes. To his munificence the Latin world was in- 
debted for the versions of Xenophon, Diodorus, Polybius, Thucydides, 
Herodotus, and Appian; of Strabp's Geography, of the Iliad, of the 
most valuable works of Plato and Aristotle, of Ptolemy and Theo- 
phrastus, and of the fathers of the Greek church. The example of the 
Roman pontiff was preceded or imitated by a Florentine merchant, 
who governed the republic without arms, and without a title. Cosmo 
of Medicis 112 was the father of a line of princes whose name and age 
are almost synonymous with the restoration of learning: his credit was 
ennobled into fame; his riches were dedicated to the service of man- 
kind; he corresponded at once with Cairo and London; and a cargo of 
Indian spices and Greek books was often imported in the same vessel. 
The genius and education of his grandson Lorenzo rendered him not 
only a patron but a judge and candidate in the literary race. In his 
palace, distress was entitled to relief, and merit to reward: his leisure 
hours were delightfully spent in the Platonic academy; he encouraged 
the emulation of Demetrius Chalcocondyles and Angelo Politian; and 
his active missionary Janus Lascaris returned from the East with a 
treasure of two hundred manuscripts, fourscore of which were as yet 
unknown in the libraries of Europe. 113 The rest of Italy was animated 
by a similar spirit, and the progress of the nation repaid the liberality 
of her princes. The Latins held the exclusive property of their own 
literature; and these disciples of Greece were soon capable of transmit- 
ting and improving the lessons which they had imbibed. After a short 
succession of foreign teachers, the tide of emigration subsided; but the 
language of Constantinople was spread beyond the Alps, and the Na- 
tives of France, Germany, and England n * imparted to their country 
the sacred fire which they had kindled in the schools of Florence and 
Rome. 115 In the productions of the mind, as in those of the soil, the

gifts of nature are excelled by industry and skill: the Greek authors, 
forgotten on the banks of the Ilissus, have been illustrated on those of 
the Elbe and the Thames; and Bessarion or Gaza might have envied 
the superior science of the barbarians, the accuracy of Budaeus, the 
taste of Erasmus, the copiousness of Stephens, the erudition of Scaliger, 
the discernment of Reiske or of Bentley. On the side of the Latins the 
discovery of printing was a casual advantage; but this useful art has 
been applied by Aldus and his innumerable successors to perpetuate 
and multiply the works of antiquity. 116 A single manuscript imported 
from Greece is revived in ten thousand copies, and each copy is fairer 
than the original. In this form Homer and Plato would peruse with 
more satisfaction their own writings; and their scholiasts must resign 
the prize to the labours of our Western editors. 

Before the arrival of classic literature the barbarians in Europe were 
immersed in ignorance; and their vulgar tongues were marked with the 
rudeness and poverty of their manners. The students of the more per- 
fect idioms of Rome and Greece were introduced to a new world of light 
and science; to the society of the free and polished nations of antiq- 
uity; and to a familiar converse with those immortal men who spoke 
the sublime language of eloquence and reason. Such an intercourse 
must tend to refine the taste and to elevate the genius of the moderns; 
and yet, from the first experiment, it might appear that the study of 
the ancients had given fetters, rather than wings, to the human mind. 
However laudable, the spirit of imitation is of a servile cast; and the 
first disciples of the Greeks and Romans were a colony of strangers in 
the midst of their age and country. The minute and laborious dili- 
gence which explored the antiquities of remote times might have im- 
proved or adorned the present state of society; the critic and meta- 
physician were the slaves of Aristotle; the poets, historians, and orators 
were proud to repeat the thoughts and words of the Augustan age: 
the works of nature were observed with the eyes of Pliny and Theo- 
phrastus; and some Pagan votaries professed a secret devotion to the 
gods of Homer and Plato. 117 The Italians were oppressed by the 

110 The press of Aldus Manutius, a Roman, was established at Venice 
about the year 1494: he printed above sixty considerable works of Greek 
literature, almost all for the first time; several containing different treatises 
and authors, and of several authors two, three, or four editions (Fabric. 
Biblioth. Graec. torn. xiii. p. 605, etc.). Yet his glory must not tempt us 
to forget that the first Greek book, the Grammar of Constantine Lascaris, 
was printed at Milan in 1476, and that the Florence Homer of 1488 displays 
all the luxury of the typographical art. See the Annales Typographic! 
of Mattaire, and the Bibliographic Instructive of De Bure, a knowing 
bookseller of Paris. 

n7 I will select three singular examples of this classic enthusiasm, i. At 
the synod of Florence, Gemistus Pletho said, in familiar conversation, to 
George of Trebizond, that in a short time mankind would unanimously 
renounce the Gospel and the Koran for a religion similar to that of the 
Gentiles (Leo Allatius, apud Fabricium, torn. x. p. 751). 2. Paul II. 
persecuted the Roman academy, which had been founded by Pomponius 
Laetus; and the principal members were accused of heresy, impiety, and

strength and number of their ancient auxiliaries: the century after the 
deaths of Petrarch and Boccace was filled with a crowd of Latin imi- 
tators, who decently repose on our shelves; but in that era of learning 
it will not be easy to discern a real discovery of science, a work of in- 
vention or eloquence, in the popular language of the country. 118 But 
as soon as it had been deeply saturated with the celestial dew, the soil 
was quickened into vegetation and life; the modern idioms were re- 
fined; the classics of Athens and Rome inspired a pure taste and a gen- 
erous emulation; and in Italy, as afterwards in France and England, 
the pleasing reign of poetry and fiction was succeeded by the light of 
speculative and experimental philosophy. Genius may anticipate the 
season of maturity; but in the education of a people, as in that of an 
individual, memory must be exercised before the powers of reason and 
fancy can be expanded: nor may the artist hope to equal or surpass, 
till he has learned to imitate, the works of his predecessors.

THE respective merits of Rome and Constantinople are compared and 
celebrated by an eloquent Greek, the father of the Italian schools. 1 
The view of the ancient capital, the seat of his ancestors, surpassed the 
most sanguine expectations of Manuel Chrysoloras; and he no longer 
blamed the exclamation of an old sophist, that Rome was the habita- 
tion, not of men, but of gods. Those gods, and those men, had long 
since vanished; but, to the eye of liberal enthusiasm, the majesty of 
ruin restored the image of her ancient prosperity. The monuments of 
the consuls and Caesars, of the martyrs and apostles, engaged on all 
sides the curiosity of the philosopher and the Christian; and he con- 

paganism (Tiraboschi, torn. vL P. i. p. 81, 82). 3. In the next century 
some scholars and poets in France celebrated the success of Jodelle's tragedy 
of Cleopatra by a festival of Bacchus, and, as it is said, by the sacrifice 
of a goat (Bayle, Dictionnaire, JODELLE; Fontenelle, torn. iii. p. 56-61). Yet 
the spirit of bigotry might often discern a serious impiety in the sportive 
play of fancy and learning. 

"^The survivor Boccace died in the year 1375; and we cannot place 
before 1480 the composition of the Morgante Maggiore of Pulci, and the 
Orlando Inamorato of Boiardo (Tiraboschi, torn. vi. P. ii. p. 174-177). 

x The epistle of Manuel Chrysoloras to the emperor John Palseologus 
will not offend the eye or ear of a classical student (ad calcem Codini de 
Antiquitatibus C. P. p. 107-126). The superscription suggests a chrono- 
logical remark, that John Palaeologus II. was associated in the empire 
before the year 1414, the date of Chrysoloras's death. A still earlier date, 
at least 1408, is deduced from the age of his youngest sons, Demetrius and 
Thomas, who were both Porphyrogeniti (Ducange, Fam. Byzant. p. 244, 247). 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 727 

fessed that in every age the arms and the religion of Rome were des- 
tined to reign over the earth. While Chrysoloras admired .the venerable 
beauties of the mother, he was not forgetful of his native country, her 
fairest daughter, her Imperial colony; and the Byzantine patriot ex- 
patiates with zeal and truth on the eternal advantages of nature, and 
the more transitory glories of art and dominion, which adorned, or had 
adorned, the city of Constantine. Yet the perfection of the copy still 
redounds (as he modestly observes) to the honour of the original, and 
parents are delighted to be renewed, and even excelled, by the superior 
merit of their children. " Constantinople," says the orator, " is situate 
on a commanding point between Europe and Asia, between the Archi* 
pelago and the Euxine. By her interposition the two seas and the two 
continents are united for the common benefit of nations; and the gates 
of commerce may be shut or opened at her command. The harbour, 
encompassed on all sides by the sea and the continent, is the most se- 
cure and capacious in the world. The walls and gates of Constanti- 
nople may be compared with those of Babylon: the towers are many; 
each tower is a solid and lofty structure; and the second wall, the 
outer fortification, would be sufficient for the defence and dignity of ar* 
ordinary capital. A broad and rapid stream may be introduced into 
the ditches; and the artificial island may be encompassed, like Athens, 2 
by land or water." Two strong and natural causes are alleged for the 
perfection of the model of new Rome. The royal founder reigned over 
the most illustrious nations of the globe; and in the accomplishment of 
his designs the power of the Romans was combined with the art and 
science of the Greeks. Other cities have been reared to maturity by 
accident and time: their beauties are mingled with disorder and deform- 
ity; and the inhabitants, unwilling to remove from their natal spot, 
are incapable of correcting the errors of their ancestors and the original 
vices of situation or climate. But the free idea of Constantinople was 
formed and executed by a single mind; and the primitive model was 
improved by the obedient zeal of the subjects and successors of the 
first monardh. The adjacent isles were stored with an inexhaustible 
supply of marble; but the various materials were transported from the 
most remote shores of Europe and Asia; and the public and private 
buildings, the palaces, churches, aqueducts, cisterns, porticoes, col- 
umns, baths, and hippodromes, were adapted to the greatness of the 
capital of .the East The superfluity of wealth was spread along the 
shores of Europe and Asia; and the Byzantine territory, as far as the 
Euxine, the Hellespont, and the long wall, might be considered as a 
populous suburb and a perpetual garden. In this flattering picture, the 
past and the present, ike times of prosperity and decay, are artfully 

"Somebody observed that the city of Athens might be circumnavigated

confounded: but a sigh and a confession escape from the orator, that 
his wretched country was the shadow and sepulchre of its former self. 
The works of ancient sculpture had been defaced by Christian zeal or 
barbaric violence; the fairest structures were demolished; and the mar- 
bles of Paros or Numidia were burnt for lime, or applied to the meanest 
uses. Of many a statue, the place was marked by an empty pedestal; 
of many a column, the size was determined by a broken capital; the 
tombs of the emperors were scattered on the ground; the stroke of time 
was accelerated by storms and earthquakes; and the vacant space was 
adorned by vulgar tradition with fabulous monuments of gold and sil- 
ver. From these wonders, which lived only in memory or belief, he 
distinguishes, however, the porphyry pillar, the column and colossus of 
Justinian, 8 and the church, more especially the dome, of St. Sophia; 
the best conclusion, since it could not be described according to its 
merits, and after it no other object could deserve to be mentioned. But 
he forgets that, a century before, the trembling fabrics of the colossus 
and the church had been saved and supported by the timely care of 
Andronicus the Elder. Thirty years after the emperor had fortified 
St. Sophia with two new buttresses or pyramids, the eastern hemisphere 
suddenly gave way; and the images, the altars, and the sanctuary were 
crushed by the falling ruin. The mischief indeed was speedily re- 
paired; the rubbish was cleared by the incessant labour of every rank 
and age; and the poor remains of riches and industry were consecrated 
by the Greeks to the most stately and venerable temple of the East. 4 
The last hope of the falling city and empire was placed in the har- 
mony of the mother and daughter, in the maternal tenderness of Rome, 
and the filial obedience of Constantinople. In the synod of Florence, 
the Greeks and Latins had embraced, and subscribed, and promised; 
but these signs of friendship were perfidious or fruitless; 5 and the base- 
less fabric of the union vanished like a dream. 6 The emperor and his 

*Nicephorus Gregoras has described the colossus of Justinian (1. vii. 12) : 
but his measures are false and inconsistent. The editor Boivin consulted 
his friend Girardon; and the sculptor gave him the true proportions of an 
equestrian statue. That of Justinian was still visible to Peter Gyllius 
not on the column, but in the outward court of the seraglio; and he was 
at Constantinople when it was melted down, and cast into a brass cannon 
(de Topograph. C P. 1. ii. c. 17). 

*See the decay and repairs of St. Sophia, in Nicephorus Gregoras (L vii. 12, 
L xy. 2). The building was propped by Andronicus in 1317, the eastern 
hemisphere fell in 1345. The Greeks, in their pompous rhetoric, exalt the 
beauty and holiness of the church, an earthly heaven, the abode of angels 
and of God himself, etc. 

*The genuine and original narrative of Syropulus (p. 312-351) opens 
the schism from the first office of the Greeks at Venice to the general oppo- 
sition at Constantinople of the clergy and people. 

On the schism of Constantinople, see Phranza (1. ii. c. 17), Laonicus 
aialcocondyles (1. vi. p. 155, 156 [p. 292-295, ed. Bonn]), and Ducas (c. 31) ; 
the last of whom writes with truth and freedom. Among the moderns we 
may distinguish the continuator of Fleury (torn. xxii. p. 338, etc., 401, 420, 
etc.) and Spondanus (A.D. 1440-50). The sense of the latter is drowned 
m nremdice and passion as soon as Rome and religion are concerned. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRK 7*9 

prdates returned home in the Venetian galleys; but as they touched 
at the Morea and the isles of Corfu and Lesbos, the subjects of the 
Latins complained that the pretended union would be an instrument of 
oppression. No sooner did they lanfi on the Byzantine shore, than they 
were saluted, or rather assailed, with a general murmur of zeal and 
discontent. During their absence, above two years, the capital had 
been deprived of its civil and ecclesiastical rulers; fanaticism fer- 
mented in anarchy; the most furious monks reigned over the conscience 
of women and bigots; and the hatred of the Latin name was the first 
principle of nature and religion. Before his departure for Italy the 
emperor had flattered the city with the assurance of a prompt relief 
and a powerful succour; and the clergy, confident in their orthodoxy 
and science, had promised themselves and their flocks an easy victory 
over the blind shepherds of the West. The double disappointment ex- 
asperated the Greeks; the conscience of the subscribing prelates was 
awakened; the hour of temptation was past; and they had more to 
dread from the public resentment than they could hope from the favour 
of the emperor or the pope. Instead of justifying their conduct, the}' 
deplored their weakness, professed their contrition, and cast themselves 
on the mercy of God and of their brethren. To the reproachful ques- 
tion, what had been the event or the use of their Italian synod? they 
answered, with sighs and tears, " Alas! we have made a new faith; we 
have exchanged piety for impiety; he have betrayed the immaculate 
sacrifice; and we are become Azymites." (The Azymites were those 
who celebrated the communion with unleavened bread; and I must re- 
tract or qualify the praise which I have bestowed on the growing phi- 
losophy of the times.) "Alas! we have been seduced by distress, by 
fraud, and by the hopes and fears of a transitory life. The hand that 
has signed the union should be cut off; and the tongue that has pro- 
nounced the Latin creed deserves to be torn from the root." The best 
proof of their repentance was an increase of zeal for the most trivial 
rites and the most incomprehensible doctrines; and an absolute separa- 
tion from all, without excepting their prince, who preserved some re- 
gard for honour and consistency. After the decease of the patriarch 
Joseph, the archbishops of Heradea and Trebizond had courage to re- 
fuse the vacant office; and Cardinal Bessarion preferred the warm and 
comfortable shelter of the Vatican. The choice of the emperor and his. 
clergy was confined to Metrophanes of Cyzicus: he was consecrated in 
St. Sophia, but the temple was vacant. The crossbearers abdicated 
their service; the infection spread from the city to the villages; and 
Metrophanes discharged, without effect, some ecclesiastical thunders, 
against a nation of schismatics. The eyes of the Greeks were directed 
to Mark of Ephesus, the champion of his country; and the sufferings- 
of the holy confessor were repaid with a tribute of admiration and ap- 
plause. His example and writings propagated the flame of religious, 
discord; age and infirmity soon removed him from the world; but the- 
gospel of Mark was not a law of forgiveness; and he requested with h&amp;

dying breath that none of the adherents of Rome might attend his obse- 
quies or pray for his soul. 

The schism was not confined to the narrow limits of the Byzantine 
empire. Secure, under the Mamaluke sceptre, the three patriarchs of 
Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem assembled a numerous synod; dis- 
owned their representatives at Ferrara and Florence; condemned the 
&lt;a:eed and council of 'the Latins; and threatened the emperor of Con- 
stantinople with the censures of the Eastern church. Of the sectaries of 
the Greek communion, the Russians were the most powerful, ignorant, 
and superstitious. Their primate, the cardinal Isidore, hastened from 
Florence to Moscow, 7 to reduce the independent nation under the 
Roman yoke. But the Russian bishops had been educated at Mount 
Athos;. and the prince and people embraced the theology of their 
priests. They were scandalised by the title, the pomp, the Latin cross 
of the legate, the friend of those impious men who shaved their beards, 
and performed the divine office with gloves on their hands and rings on 
their fingers: Isidore was condemned by a synod; his person was im- 
prisoned in a monastery; and it was with extreme difficulty that the 
cardinal could escape frojn the hands ot a tierce arid fanatic people. 8 
The Russians refused a passage to the missionaries of Rome who as- 
pired to convert the Pagans beyond the Tanais; and their refusal was 
justified by the maxim that the guilt of idolatry is less damnable than 
that of schism. The errors of the Bohemians were excused by their 
abhorrence for the pope; and a deputation of the Greek clergy so- 
licited the friendship of those sanguinary enthusiasts. 10 While Eu- 
genius triumphed in the union and orthodoxy of the Greeks, his party 
was contracted to the walls, or rather to the palace, of Constantinople. 
The zeal of Palaeologus had been excited by interest; it was soon cooled 
by opposition: an attempt to violate the national belief might endanger 

*Isidoie was metropolitan of Kiow. but the Greeks subject to Poland 
have removed that see from the ruins of Kiow to Lemberg, or Leopold

transferred, their spiritual obedience to the archbishop, who became, in 
1588, the patriarch of Moscow (Levesque, Hist de Russie, torn. iii. p. 188, 
190, from a Greek MS- at Turin, Iter et labores Archiepiscopi Arsenii).

his life and crown; nor could the pious rebels be destitute of foreign 
and domestic aid. The sword of his brother Demetrius, who in Italy 
had maintained a prudent and popular silence, was half unsheathed in 
the cause of religion; and Amurath, the Turkish sultan, was displeased 
and alarmed by the seeming friendship of the Greeks and Latins. 

" Sultan Murad, or Amurath, lived forty-nine, and reigned thirty 
years,, six months, and eight days. He was a just and valiant prince, 
of a great soul, patient of labours, learned, merciful, religious, charit- 
able; a lover and encourager of the studious, and of all who excelled in 
any art of science; a good emperor, and a great general. No man ob- 
tained more or greater victories than Amurath; Belgrade alone withstood 
his attacks. Under his reign the soldier was ever victorious, thfr citizen 
rich and secure. If he subdued any country, his first care was to build 
mosques and caravanseras, hospitals and colleges. Every year he gave 
a thousand pieces of gold to the sons of the Prophet, and sent two thou- 
sand five hundred to the religious persons of Mecca, Medina, and Jeru- 
salem." u This portrait is transcribed from the historian of the Oth- 
man empire: but the applause of a servile and superstitious people has 
been lavished on the worst of tyrants; and the virtues of a sultan are 
often the vices most useful to himself, or most agreeable to his subjects. 
A nation ignorant of the equal benefits of liberty and law must be awed 
by the flashes of arbitrary power: the cruelty of a despot will assume the 
character of justice; his profusion, of liberality; his obstinacy, of firm- 
ness. If the most reasonable excuse be rejected, few acts of obedience 
will be found impossible; and guilt must tremble, where innocence 
cannot always be secure. The tranquillity of the people, and the disci- 
pline of the troops, were best maintained by perpetual action in the 
field: war was the trade of the Janizaries; and those who survived the 
peril, and 'divided the spoil, applauded the generous ambition of their 
sovereign. To propagate the true religion was the duty of a faithful 
Musulman: the unbelievers were his enemies, and those of the Prophet; 
and, in the hands of the Turks, the scimitar was the only instrument of 
conversion. Under these circumstances, however, the justice and mod- 
eration of Amurath are attested by his conduct, and acknowledged by 
the Christians themselves, who consider a prosperous reign and a peace* 
ful death as the reward of his singular merits. In the vigour of his age 
and military power he seldom engaged in war till he was justified by a 
previous and adequate provocation: the victorious sultan was disarmed 
by submission; and in lie observance of treaties, his word was inviolate 
and sacred. 12 The Hungarians were commonly the aggressors; he was

example to his son Mohammed. 



732 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

provoked by the revolt of Scanderbeg; and the perfidious Carainanian 
was twice vanquished, and twice pardoned, by the Ottoman monarch. 
Before he invaded the Morea, Thebes had been surprised by the despot: 
in the conquest of Thessalonica the grandson of Bajazet might dispute 
the recent purchase of tie Venetians; and after the first siege of Con- 
stantinople, the sultan was never tempted, by the distress, the absence, 
or the injuries of Palaeologus, to extinguish the dying light of the By- 
zantine empire. 

But the most striking feature in the life and character of Amurath 
. is the double abdication of the Turkish throne; and, were not his mo- 
tives debased by an alloy of superstition, we must praise the royal phi- 
losopher, 18 who at the age of forty could discern the vanity of human 
greatness. Resigning the sceptre to his son, he retired to the pleasant 
residence of Magnesia; but he retired to the society of saints and her- 
mits. It was not till the fourth century of the Hegira that the religion 
of Mohammed had been corrupted by an institution so adverse to his 
genius; but in the age of the crusades the various orders of dervishes 
ware multiplied by the example of the Christian, and even the Latin, 
monks. 14 The lord of nations submitted to fast, and pray, and turn 
round in endless rotation with the fanatics, who mistook the giddiness 
of the head for the illumination of the spirit. 15 But he was soon awak- 
ened from this dream of enthusiasm by the Hungarian invasion; and 
his obedient son was the foremost to urge the public danger and the 
wishes of the people. Under the banner of their veteran leader, the 
Janizaries fought and conquered; but he withdrew from the field of 
Varna, again to pray, to fast, and to turn round with the Magnesian 
brethren. These pious occupations were again interrupted by the dan- 
ger of the state. A victorious army disdained the inexperience of their 
youthful ruler: the city of Adrianople was abandoned to rapine and 
slaughter; and the unanimous divan implored his presence to appease 
the tumult, and prevent the rebellion, of the Janizaries. At the well- 
known voice of their master they trembled and obeyed; and the reluc- 
tant sultan was compelled to support his splendid servitude, till, at the 
end of four years, he was relieved by the angel of death. Age or disease, 
misfortune or caprice, have tempted several princes to descend from 

"Voltaire (Essai sur 1'Histoire Generate, c. 89, p. 283, 284) admires L

prince for retiring to a monastery? In his way, Voltaire was a bigot, an 
intolerant bigot. 

"See the articles Dervische, Fakir, Nasser, Rohbaniat, in D'Herbelot's 
Bibliptheque Orientate. Yet the subject is superficially treated from the 
Persian and Arabian writers. It is among the Turks that these orders 
have principally flourished. 

"Rycaut (in the Present State of the Ottoman Empire, p. 242-268) affords 
much information, which he drew from his personal conversation with 
the heads of the dervishes, most of whom ascribed their origin to the time 
of Orchan. He does not mention the Zichida of Chalcocondyles (1. vii. p. 
186 [p. 352, ed Bonn]), among whom Amurath retired: the Seids of that 
author are the descendants of Mohammed. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 733 

the throne; and they have had leisure to repent of their irretrievable 
step. But Amurath alone, in the full liberty of choice, after the trial of 
empire and solitude, has repeated his preference of a private life. 

After the departure of his Greek brethren, Eugenius had not been 
unmindful of their temporal interest; and his tender regard for the By- 
zantine empire was animated by a just apprehension of the Turks, who 
approached, and might soon invade, the borders of Italy. But the 
spirit of the crusades had expired; and the coldness of the Franks was 
not less unreasonable than their headlong passion. In the eleventh 
century a fanatic monk could precipitate Europe on Asia for the re- 
covery of the holy sepulchre: but in the fifteenth, the most pressing 
motives of religion and policy were insufficient to unite the Latins in 
the defence of Christendom. Germany was an inexhaustible storehouse 
of men and arms: 16 but that complex and languid body required the 
impulse of a vigorous hand; and Frederic the Third was alike impotent 
in his personal character and his Imperial dignity. A long war had 
impaired the strength, without satiating the animosity, of France and 
England; 17 but Philip duke of Burgundy was a vain and magnificent 
prince; and he enjoyed, without danger or expense, the adventurous 
piety of his subjects, who sailed, in a gallant fleet, from the coast of 
Flanders to the Hellespont. The maritime republics of Venice and 
Genop, were less remote from the scene of action; and their hostile fleets 
were associated under the standard of St. Peter. The kingdoms of 
Hungary and Poland, which covered as it were the interior pale of the 
Latin church, were the most nearly concerned to oppose the progress 
of the Turks. Arms were the patrimony of the Scythians and Sarma- 
tians; and these nations might appear equal to the contest, could they 
point, against the common foe, those swords that were so wantonly 
drawn in bloody and domestic quarrels. But the same spirit was ad- 
verse to concord and obedience: a poor country and a limited monarch 
are incapable of maintaining a standing force; and tie loose bodies of 
Polish and Hungarian horse were not armed with the sentiments and 
weapons which, on some occasions, have given irresistible weight to the 
French chivalry. Yet, on this side, the designs of the Roman pontiff, 
and the eloquence of Cardinal Julian, his legate, were promoted by 

"In the year 1431 Germany raised 40,000 horse, men-at-arms, against 
tHe Hussites of Bohemia (Lenfant, Hist, du Concile de Basle, torn. i. p. 318). 
At the siege of Nuys, on the Rhine, in 1474, the princes, prelates, and 
cities sent their respective quotas; and the bishop of Munster (qui n'est 
pas des plus grands) furnished 1400 horse, 6000 foot, all in green, with 
1200 waggons. The united armies of the king of England and the duke of 
Burgundy scarcely equalled one-third of this German host (Memoires de 
Philippe de Commes, 1. iv. c. 2). At present, six or seven hundred thousand 
rren are maintained in constant pay and admirable discipline by the powers 
of Germany. 

1T It was not till the year 1444 that France and England could agree on a 
truce of some months. (See Rymer's Fcedera, and the chronicles of both 
nations.)

the circumstances of the times; 18 by the union of the two crowns on the 
head of Ladislaus, 19 a young and ambitious soldier; by the valour of a 
hero, whose name, the name of John Huniades, was already popular 
among the Christians, and formidable to the Turks. An endless treas- 
ure of pardons and indulgences was scattered by the legate; many pri- 
vate warriors of France and Germany enlisted under the holy banner; 
and the crusade derived some strength, or at least some reputation, 
from the new allies both .of Europe and Asia. A fugitive despot of 
Servia exaggerated the distress and ardour of the Christians beyond 
the Danube, who would unanimously rise to vindicate their religion and 
liberty. The Greek emperor, 20 with a spirit unknown to his fathers, 
engaged to guard the Bosphorus, and to sally from Constantinople at 
the head of his national and mercenary troops. The sultan of Cara- 
mania 21 announced the retreat of Amurath, and a powerful diversion 
in the heart of Anatolia; and if the fleets of the West could occupy at 
the same moment the straits of the Hellespont, the Ottoman monarchy 
would be dissevered, and destroyed. Heaven and earth must rejoice 
in the perdition of the miscreants; and the legate, with prudent am- 
biguity, instilled the opinion of the invisible, perhaps the visible, aid 
of the Son of God and his divine mother. 

Of the Polish and Hungarian diets a religious war was the unanimous 
cry; and Ladislaus, after passing the Danube, led an army of his con- 
federate subjects as far as Sophia, the capital of the Bulgarian kingdom. 
In this expedition they obtained two signal victories, which were justly 
ascribed to the valour and conduct of Huniades. In the first, with a 
vanguard of ten thousand men, he surprised the Turkish camp; in the 
second, he vanquished and made prisoner the most renowned of their 
generals, who possessed the double advantage of ground and numbers. 
The approach of winter, and the natural and artificial obstacles of Mount 
Hsemiis, arrested the progress of the hero, who measured a narrow in- 
terval of six days' march from the. foot of the mountains to the hostile 
towers of Adrianople and the friendly capital of the Greek empire. The

of Caramania.

retreat was undisturbed; and the entrance into Buda was at once a 
military and religious triumph. An ecclesiastical procession was fol- 
lowed by the king and his warriors on foot: he nicely balanced the 
merits and rewards of the two nations; and the pride of conquest was 
blended with the humble temper of Christianity. Thirteen bashaws, 
nine standards, and four thousand captives, were unquestionable tro- 
phies; and as all were willing; to believe, and none were present to con- 
tradict, the crusaders multiplied, with unblushing confidence, the myri- 
ads of Turks whom they had left on the field of battle. 22 The most solid 
proof, and the most salutary consequence, of victory, was a deputation 
from the divan to solicit peace, to restore Servia, to ransom the pris- 
oners, and to evacuate the Hungarian frontier. By this treaty the 
rational objects of the war were obtained: the king, the despot, and 
Huniades himself, in the diet of Segedin, were satisfied with public and 
private emolument; a truce of ten years was concluded; and the fol- 
lowers of Jesus and Mohammed, who swore on the Gospel and the 
Koran, attested the word of God as the guardian of truth and the 
avenger of perfidy. In the place of the Gospel the Turkish ministers 
had proposed to substitute the Eucharist, the real presence of the Cath- 
olic Deity; but the Christians refused to profane their holy mysteries; 
and a superstitious conscience is less forcibly bound by the spiritual 
energy than by the outward and visible symbols of an oath. 23 

During the whole transaction the cardinal legate had observed a sul- 
len silence, unwilling to approve, and unable to oppose, the consent of 
the king and people. But the diet was not dissolved before Julian was 
fortified by the welcome intelligence that Anatolia was invaded by the 
Cararaanian, and Thrace by the Greek emperor; that the fleets of 
Genoa, Venice, and Burgundy were masters of the Hellespont; and that 
the allies, informed of the victory, and ignorant of the treaty, of Ladis- 
laus, impatiently waited for the return of his victorious army. " And is 
it thus," exclaimed the cardinal, 2 * " that you will desert their expecta- 
tions and your own fortune? It is to them, to your God, and your fel- 
low-Christians, that you have pledged your faith; and that prior obli- 
gation annihilates a rash and sacrilegious oath to the enemies of Christ. 

31 In their letters to the emperor Frederic III. the Hungarians slay 30,000 
Turks in one battle; but the modest Julian reduces the slaughter to 6000 
or even 2000 infidels (^Eneas Sylvius in Europ. c. 5, and epist 44, 81, apud 
Spondanum). 

"'See the origin of the Turkish war, and the first expedition of Ladislaus, 
in the fifth and sixth books of the third decad of Bonfinius, who, in his 
division and style, copies Livy with tolerable success. Callimachus (1. ii. 
p. 487-496) is still more pure and authentic. 

34 1 dp not pretend to warrant the literal accuracy of Julian's speech, 
which is variously worded by Callimachus (1. iii. p. 505-507), Bonfinius 
(dec. iii. 1. vi. p. 457, 458), and other historians, who might indulge their 
own eloquence, while they represent one of the orators of the age. But 
they all agree in the advice and arguments for perjury, which in the field 
of .controversy are fiercely attacked by the Protestants, and feebly defended 
by the Catholics. The latter are discouraged by the misfortune of Varna, 



736 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

His vicar on earth is the Roman pontiff; without whose sanction you 
can neither promise nor perform. In his name I absolve your per- 
jury and sanctify your arms: follow my footsteps in the paths of 
glory and salvation; and if still you have scruples, devolve on my head 
the punishment and the sin." This mischievous casuistry was seconded 
by his respectable character and the levity of popular assemblies: war 
was resolved on the same spot where peace had so lately been sworn; 
and, in the execution of the treaty, the Turks were assaulted by the 
Christians, to whom, with some reason, they might apply the epithet of 
Infidels. The falsehood of Ladislaus to his word and oath was palliated 
by the religion of the times: the most perfect, or at least the most popu- 
lar, excuse would have been the success of his arms and the deliverance 
of the Eastern church. But the same treaty which should have bound 
his conscience had diminished his strength. On the proclamation of 
the peace the French and German volunteers departed with indignant 
murmurs: the Poles were exhausted by distant warfare, and perhaps 
disgusted with foreign command; and their palatines accepted the first 
licence, and hastily retired to their provinces and castles. Even Hun- 
gary was divided by faction, or restrained by a laudable scruple; and 
the relics of the crusade that marched in the second expedition were 
reduced to an inadequate force of twenty thousand men. A Wallachian 
chief, who joined the royal standard with his vassals, presumed to re- 
mark that their numbers did not exceed the hunting retinue that some- 
times attended the sultan; and the gift of two horses of matchless speed 
might admonish Ladislaus of his secret foresight of the event. But the 
despot of Servia, after the restoration of this country and children, was 
tempted by the promise of new realms; and the inexperience of the 
king, the enthusiasm of the legate, and the martial presumption of 
Huniades himself, were persuaded that every obstacle must yield to the 
invincible virtue of the sword and the cross. After the passage of the 
Danube two roads might lead to Constantinople and the Hellespont; 
the one direct, abrupt, and difficult, through the mountains of Hsemus; 
the other more tedious and secure, over a level country, and along the 
shores of the Euxine; in which their flanks, according to the Scythian 
discipline, might always be covered by a movable fortification of wag- 
gons. The latter was judiciously preferred: the Catholics marched 
through the plains of Bulgaria, burning, with wanton cruelty, the 
churches and villages of the Christian natives; and their last station 
was at Varna, near the sea-shore; on which the defeat and death of 
Ladislaus have bestowed a memorable name. 26 

"Varna, under the Grecian name of Odessus, was a colony of the Milesians, 
which they denominated from the hero Ulysses (Cellarius, torn. L p. 374; 
D'Anville, torn. i. p. 312). According to Arrian's Periplus of the Euxine 
(p. 24, 25, in the first volume of Hudson's Geographers), it was situate 
1740 stadia, or furlongs, from the mouth of the Danube, 2140 from 
Byzantium, and 360 to the north of a ridge or promontory of Mount Haenius, 
which advances into the sea. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 737 

It was on this fatal spot that, instead of finding a confederate fleet 
to second their operations, they were alarmed by the approach of Amu- 
rath himself, who had issued from his Magnesian solitude and trans- 
ported the forces of Asia to the defence of Europe. According to some 
writers the Greek emperor had been awed, or seduced, to grant the pas- 
sage of the Bosphorus; and an indelible stain of corruption is fixed on 
the Genoese, or the pope's nephew, the Catholic admiral, whose mer- 
cenary connivance betrayed the guard of the Hellespont. From Adrian- 
ople the sultan advanced by hasty marches at the head of sixty thou- 
sand men; and when the cardinal and Huniades had taken a nearer 
survey of the numbers and order of the Turks, these ardent warriors 
proposed the tardy and impracticable measure of a retreat. The king 
alone was resolved to conquer or die; and his resolution had almost been 
crowned with a glorious and salutary victory. The princes were oppo- 
site to each other in the centre; and the Beglerbegs, or generals of Ana- 
tolia and Romania, commanded on the right and left against the adverse 
divisions of the despot and Huniades. The Turkish wings were broken 
on the first onset: but the advantage was fatal; and the rash victors, in 
the heat of the pursuit, were carried away far from the annoyance of 
the enemy or the support of their friends. When Amurath beheld the 
flight of his squadrons, he despaired of his fortune and that of the em- 
pire: a veteran Janizary seized his horse's bridle; and he had mag- 
nanimity to pardon and reward the soldier who dared to perceive the 
terror, and arrest the flight, of his sovereign. A copy of the treaty, the 
monument of Christian perfidy, had been displayed in the front of 
battle; and it is said that the sultan in his distress, lifting his eyes and 
his hands to heaven, implored the protection of the God of truth; and 
called on the prophet Jesus himself to avenge the impious mockery of 
his name and religion. 26 With inferior numbers and disordered ranks 
the king of Hungary rushed forwards in the confidence of victory, till 
his cireer was stopped by the impenetrable phalanx of the Janizaries. 
If we may credit lie Ottoman annals, his horse was pierced by the 
javelin of Amurath; 27 he fell among the spears of the infantry J and a 
Turkish soldier proclaimed with a loud voice, " Hungarians, behold the 
head of your king! " The death of Ladislaus was the signal of their 
defeat. On his return from an intemperate pursuit, Huniades deplored 
his error and the publk loss: he strove to rescue the royal body, till 
he was overwhelmed by the tumultuous crowd of the victors and van- 
quished; and the last efforts of his courage and conduct were exerted to 

38 Some Christian writers affirm that he drew from his bosom the host or 
wafer on which the treaty had not been sworn. The Moslems suppose, with 
more simplicity, an appeal to God and his prophet Jesus, which is likewise 
insinuated by CalUmachus (1. iii. p. 516; Spondan. A.D. 1444, No. 8). 

"A critic will always distrust these spolia opima of a victorious general, 
so difficult for valour to obtain, so easy for flattery to invent (Cantemir, 
p. 90, 91). Callimachus (1. iii. p. 517) more simply and probably affirms, 
supervenientibus Janizaris, telorum multitudine, son tarn confossus est, quam 
obrutus.

save the renctoant of his Wallachian cavalry. Ten thousand Christians 
were slain in the disastrous battle of Varna: the loss of the Turks, more 
considerable in numbfers, bore a smaller proportion to their total 
strength; yet the philosophic sultan was not ashamed to confess that his 
ruin must be the consequence of a second and similar victory. At his 
command a C6lumn was erected on the spot where Ladislaus had fallen; 
but the modest inscription, instead of accusing the rashness, recorded 
the valour and .bewailed the misfortune of the Hungarian youth. 28 

Before I lose sight of the field of Varna I am tempted to pause on the 
character and story of two principal actors, the cardinal Julian and 
John Huniades. Julian 50 Caesarini was born of a noble family of 
Rome: his studies had embraced both the Latin and Greek learning, 
both the sciences of divinity and law; and his versatile genius was 
equally adapted to the schools, the camp, and the court. No sooner had 
he been invested with the Roman purple than he was sent into Germany 
to arm the empire against the rebels and heretics of Bohemia. The 
spirit of persecution is unworthy of a Christian; the military profession 
iU becomes a priest; but the former is excused by the times; and the 
latter was ennobled by the courage of Julian, who stood dauntless and 
alone in the disgraceful flight of the German host.' As the pope's legate 
he opened the council of Basil; but the president soon appeared the most 
strenuous champion of ecclesiastical freedom; and an opposition of 
seven years was conducted by his ability and zeal. After promoting the 
strongest measures .against the authority and person of Eugenius&gt; some 
secret motive of interest or conscience engaged him to desert on a sud- 
den the popular party.. The cardinal withdrew himself from Basil to 
Ferrara; and, in the debates of the Greeks and Latins, the two nations 
admired the dexterity of his arguments and the depth of his theological 
erudition. 80 In his Hungarian embassy we have already seen the mis- 
chievous effects of his sophistry and eloquence, of which Julian himself 
was the first victim. The cardinal, who performed the duties of a 
priest and a soldier, was lost in .the defeat of Varna. The circumstances

of his death are variously related; but it is believed that a weighty in- 
cumbrance of gold impeded his flight, and tempted the cruel avarice of 
some Christian fugitives. 

From a humble, or at least a doubtful, origin the merit of John 
Huniades promoted him to the command of the Hungarian armies. 
His father was a Wallachian, his mother a Greek: her unknown race- 
might possibly ascend to the emperors of .Constantinople; and the 
claims of the Wallachians, with the surname of Corvinus, from the place 
of his nativity, might suggest a thin pretence for mingling his blood with 
the patricians of ancient Rome. 81 In his youth he served in the wars 
of Italy, and was retained, with twelve horsemen, by the bishop of 
Zagrab: the valour of the white knight 82 was soon conspicuous; he in- 
creased his fortunes by a noble and wealthy marriage; and in the de- 
fence of the Hungarian borders he won in the same year three battles 
against the Turks. By his influence Ladislaus of, Poland obtained the 
crown of Hungary; and the important service was rewarded by the 
title and office of Waivod of Transylvania. The first of Julian's cru- 
sades added two Turkish laurels on his brow; and in the public distress 
the fatal errors of Varna were forgotten. During the absence and 
minority of Ladislaus of Austria, the titular, king,. Huniades was elected 
supreme captain and governor of Hungary; and if envy at first was 
silenced by terror, a reign of twelve years supposes the arts of policy 
as well as of war. Yet the idea of a consummate general is not deline- 
ated in his campaigns; the white knight fought with the hand rather 
than- the head, as the chief of desultory barbarians, who attack without 
fear and fly without shame; and his military life is composed of a 
romantic alternative of victories and escapes. By the Turks, who em- 
ployed his name to frighten their perverse children, he was corruptly 
denominated Jancus Lain, or the Wicked: their hatred is the proof of 
their esteem; the kingdom which he guarded was inaccessible to their 
arms; and they felt him most daring and formidable when they fondly 
believed the captain and his country irrecoverably lost. Instead of con- 
fining himself to a defensive war, four years after the defeat of Varna 
he again penetrated into the heart of Bulgaria, and in the plain ,of 
Cossova sustained, till the third day, the shock of the Ottoman army, 
four times more numerous than his own. As he fled alone through the 
woods of Wallachia, the hero was surprised by two robbers; but while 
they disputed a gold' chain that hung at his, neck, he recovered his 
sword 1 , slew the one, terrified the other, and, after new perils of cap-

which confounded the name of a Wallachian village with the 'casual, though 
glorious, epithet of a single' branch of the Valerian family at Rome?

times, mentions him with' high encomiums, but under the whimsical name

arid the Turkish annals of Letraclavius, presume to accuse his fidelity of 
valour.

tivity or death, consoled by his presence an afflicted kingdom. But the 
last and most glorious action of his life was the defence of Belgrade 
against the powers of Mohammed the Second in person. After a siege 
of forty days the Turks, who had already entered the town, were com- 
pelled to retreat; and the joyful nations celebrated Huniades and Bel- 
grade as the bulwarks of Christendom. 88 About a month after this 
great deliverance the champion expired; and his most splendid epitaph 
is the regret of the Ottoman prince, who sighed that he could no longer 
hope for revenge against the single antagonist who had triumphed over 
his arms. On the first vacancy of the throne Matthias Corvinus, a youth 
of eighteen years of age, was elected and crowned by the grateful Hun- 
garians. His reign was prosperous and long: Matthias aspired to the 
glory of a conqueror and a saint; but his purest merit is the encour- 
agement of learning; and the Latin orators and historians, who were 
invited from Italy by the son, have shed the lustre of their eloquence 
on the father's character. 84 

In the list of heroes John Huniades and Scanderbeg are commonly 
associated; 85 and they are both entitled to our notice, since their occu- 
pation of the Ottoman arms delayed the ruin of the Greek empire. 
John Castriot, the father of Scanderbeg, 86 was the hereditary prince of 
a small district of Epirus, or Albania, between the mountains and the 
Adriatic Sea. Unable to contend with the sultan's power, Castriot 
submitted to the hard conditions of peace and tribute: he delivered his 
four sons as the pledges of his fidelity; and the Christian youths, after 
receiving the mark of circumcision, were instructed in the Mohammedan 

"See Bonfinius (decad iii. 1. viii. p. 492) and Spondanus (A.D. 1456, 
No. 1-7). Huniades shared the glory of the defence of Belgrade with 
Capistran, a Franciscan friar; and in their respective narratives, neither 
the saint nor the hero condescends to take notice of his rival's merit. 

"See Bonfinius, decad iii. 1. viii. decad iv. 1. viii. The observations of 
Spondanus on the life and character of Matthias Corvinus are curious and 
critical (A.D. 1464, No. i; 1475, No. 6; 1476, No. 14-16; 1490, No. 4, 5). 
Italian fame was the object of his vanity. His actions are celebrated in 
the Epitome Rerum Hungaricarum (p. 322-412) of Peter Ranzanus, a 
Sicilian. His wise and facetious sayings are registered by Galestus Martius 
of Narni (528-568), and we have a particular narrative of his wedding and 
coronation. These three tracts are all contained in the first vol. of Bel's 
Scriptores Rerum Hungaricarum. 

"They are ranked by Sir William Temple, in his pleasing Essay on Heroic 
Virtue (Works, vol. iii. p. 385), among the seven chiefs who have deserved, 
without wearing, a royal crown: Belisarius, Narses, Gonsalvo of Cordova, 
William first prince of Orange, Alexander duke of Parma, John Huniades, 
and George Castriot, or Scanderbeg. 

86 1 could wish for some simple, authentic memoirs of a friend of Scander- 
beg, which would introduce me to the man, the time, and the place. In 
the^old and national history of Marinus Barletius, a priest of Scodra (de 
Vita, Moribus, et^ Rebus gestis Georgii Castrioti, etc., libri xiii. pp. 367,

many false jewels. See likewise Chakocondyles, 1. vii. p. 185, 1. viii. p. 220

THE ROMAN EMPIRE 741 

religion and trained in the arms and arts of Turkish policy . 3r The 
three elder brothers were confounded in the crowd of slaves; and the 
poison to which their deaths are ascribed cannot be verified or disproved 
by any positive evidence. Yet the suspicion is in a great measure re- 
moved by the kind and paternal treatment of George Castriot, the 
fourth brother, who, from his tender youth, displayed the strength and 
spirit of a soldier. The successive overthrow of a Tartar and two 
Persians, who carried a proud defiance to the Turkish court, recom- 
mended him to the favour of Amurath, and his Turkish appellation of 
Scanderbeg (Iskender beg), or the lord Alexander, is an indelible me- 
morial of his glory and servitude. His father's principality was re- 
duced into a province; but the loss was compensated by the rank and 
title of Sanjiak, a command of five thousand horse, and the prospect 
of the first dignities of the empire. He served with honour in the wars 
of Europe and Asia; and we may smile at the art or credulity of the 
historian, who supposes that in every encounter he spared the Christians, 
while he fell with a thundering arm on his Musulman foes. The glory 
of Huniades is without reproach: he fought in the defence of his religion 
and country; but the enemies who applaud the patriot have branded 
his rival with the name of traitor and apostate. In the eyes of the 
Christians the rebellion of Scanderbeg is justified by his father's wrongs, 
the ambiguous death of his three brothers, his own degradation, and the 
slavery of his country; and they adore the generous, though tardy, zeal 
with which he asserted the faith and independence of his ancestors. 
But he had imbibed from his ninth year the doctrines of the Koran: he 
was ignorant of the Gospel; the religion of a soldier is determined by 
authority and habit; nor is it easy to conceive what new illumination 
at the age of forty sa could be poured into his soul. His motives would 
be less exposed to the suspicion of interest or revenge, had he broken 
his chain from the moment that he was sensible of its weight: but a 
long oblivion had surely impaired his original right; and every year of 
obedience ajad reward had cemented the mutual bond of the sultan 
aiid his subject. If Scanderbeg had long harboured the belief of Chris- 
tianity and the intention of revolt, a worthy mind must condemn the 
base dissimulation that could serve only to betray, that could promise 
only to be forsworn, that could actively join in the temporal and spirit- 
ual perdition of so many thousands of his unhappy brethren. Shall we 
praise a secret correspondence with Huniades while he commanded 
the vanguard of the Turkish army? Shall we excuse the desertion of 
his standard, a treacherous desertion which abandoned the victory to 

"His circumcision, education, etc., are marked by Marinus with brevity 
and reluctance (1. i. p. 6, 7). 

"Since Scanderbeg died A.D. 1466, in the sixty-third year of his age 
(Marinus, 1. xiii. p. 370), he was born in 1403; since he was torn from his 
parents by the Turks when he was novennis (Marinus, 1. i. p. i, 6), that 
event must have happened in 1412, nine years before the accession of 
Amurath IL, who must have inherited, not acquired, the Albanian slave. 
Spondanus has remarked this inconsistency, A.D. 1431, No. 31 ; 1443, No. 14. 



74* THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

the enemies of his benefactor? In the confusion of a defeat, the eye 
of Scanderbeg was fixed on the Reis Effendi, or principal secretary: 
with the dagger at his breast, he extorted a firman or patent for the 
government of Albania; and the murder of the guiltless scribe and his 
train prevented the consequences of an immediate discovery. With 
some bold companions, to whom he had revealed his design, he escaped 
in the night by rapid marches from the field of battle to his paternal 
mountains. The gates of Croya were opened to the royal mandate; and 
no sooner did he command the fortress than George Castriot dropped 
the mask of dissimulation, abjured the prophet and the sultan, and 
proclaimed himself the avenger of his family and country. The names 
of religion and liberty provoked a general revolt: the Albanians, a mar- 
tial race, were unanimous to live and die with their hereditary prince; 
and the Ottoman garrisons were indulged in the choice of martyrdom 
or baptism. In the assembly of the states of Epirus, Scanderbeg was 
elected general of the Turkish war; and each of the allies engaged to 
furnish his respective proportion of men and money. From these con- 
tributions, from his patrimonial estate, and from the valuable salt-pits 
of Selina, he drew an annual revenue of two hundred thousand ducats; 39 
and the entire sum, exempt from the demands of luxury, was strictly 
appropriated to the public use. His manners were popular; but his 
discipline was severe; and every superfluous vice was banished from 
his camp: his example strengthened his command; and under his con- 
duct the Albanians were invincible in their own opinion and that of 
their enemies. The bravest adventurers of France and Germany were 
allured by his fame and retained in his service: his standing militia 
consisted of eight thousand horse and seven thousand foot; the horses 
were small, the men were active: but he viewed with a discerning eye 
the difficulties and resources of the mountains; and, at the blaze of the 
beacons, the whole nation was distributed in the strongest posts. With 
such unequal arms Scanderbeg resisted twenty-three years the powers 
of the Ottoman empire; and two conquerors, Amurath the Second and 
his greater son, were repeatedly baffled by a rebel whom they pursued 
with seeming contempt and implacable resentment. At the head of 
sixty thousand horse and forty thousand Janizaries, Amurath entered 
Albania: he might ravage the open country, occupy the defenceless 
towns, convert the churches into mosques, circumcise the Christian 
youths, and punish with death his adult and obstinate captives: but 
the conquests of the sultan were confined to the petty fortress of Sfeti- 
grade; and the garrison, invincible to his arms, was oppressed by a 
paltry artifice and a superstitious scruple. 40 Amurath retired with 

*His revenue and forces are luckily given by Marinus (1. ii. p. 44). 

40 There were two Dibras, the upper and lower, the Bulgarian and Albanian : 
the former, 70 miles from Croya (1. i. p. 17), was contiguous to the fortress 
of Sfetigrade, whose inhabitants refused to drink from a well into which 
a dead dog had traitorously been cast (1. Y. p. 139, 140). We want a good 
map of Epirus. ' ' . 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 743 

shame and loss from the walls of Croya, the castle and residence of the 
Castriots; the march, the siege, the retreat, were harassed by a vexa- 
tious, and almost invisible, adversary; 41 and the disappointment might 
tend to embitter, perhaps to shorten, the last days of the sultan. 42 In 
the fulness of conquest Mohammed the Second still felt at his bosom 
this domestic thorn; his lieutenants were permitted to negotiate a 
truce, and the Albanian prince may justly be praised as a firm and able 
champion of his national independence. The enthusiasm of chivalry 
and religion has ranked him with the names of Alexander and Pyrrhus; 
nor would they blush to acknowledge their intrepid countryman: but 
his narrow dominion and slender powers must leave him at a humble 
distance below the heroes of antiquity, who triumphed over the East 
and the Roman legions. His splendid achievements, the bashaws whom 
he encountered, the armies that he discomfited, and the three thousand 
Turks who were slain by his single hand, must be weighed in the scales 
of suspicious criticism. Against an illiterate enemy, and in the dark 
solitude of Epirus, his partial biographers may safely indulge the lati- 
tude of romance; but their fictions are exposed by the light of Italian 
history, and they afford a strong presumption against their own truth 
by a fabulous tale of his exploits, when he passed the Adriatic with 
eight hundred horse to the succour of the king of Naples. 43 Without 
disparagement to his fame, they might have owned that he was finally 
oppressed by the Ottoman powers; in his extreme danger he applied to 
pope Pius tie Second for a refuge in the ecclesiastical state; and his 
resources were almost exhausted, since Scanderbeg died a fugitive at 
Lissus, on the Venetian territory. 44 His sepulchre was soon violated by 
the Turkish conquerors; but the Janizaries, who wore his bones en- 
chased in a bracelet, declared by this superstitious amulet their invol- 
untary reverence for his valour. The instant ruin of his country may 
redound to the hero's glory; yet, had he balanced the consequences of 

41 Compare the Turkish narrative of Cantemir (p. 92) with the pompous 
and prolix declamation in the fourth, fifth, and sixth books of the Albanian 
priest, "who has been copied by the tribe of strangers and moderns. 

41 In honour of his hero, Barletius (1. vi. p. 188-192) kills the sultan, by 
disease indeed, under the walls of Croya. But this audacious fiction is 
disproved by the Greeks and Turks, who agree in the time and manner of 
Amurath's death at Adrianople. 

48 See the marvels of his Calabrian expedition in the ninth and tenth 
books of Marinus Barletius, which may be rectified by the testimony or 
silence of Muratori (Annali d'ltalia, torn. xiii. p. 291), and his original 
authors (Joh. Simonetta de Rebus Francisci Sfortiae, in Muratori, Script 
Rerum Ital. torn. xxi. p. 728, et alios). The Albanian cavalry, under the 
name of Stradiots; soon became famous in the wars of Italy (Memoires de 
Comines, 1. viii. c. 5). 

44 Spondanus, from the best evidence and the. most rational criticism, 
has reduced the giant Scanderbeg to the human size (A.D. 1461, No. 20; 
1463, No. 9; 1465, No. 12, 13; 1467, No. i). His own letter to the pope, 
and the testimony of Phranza (1. iii. c* 28), a refugee in the neighbouring 
isle of Corfu, demonstrate his last distress, which is awkwardly concealed 
by Marinus Barletius (L x.). . 



744 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

submission and resistance, a patriot perhaps would have declined the 
unequal contest which must depend on the life and genius of one man. 
Scanderbeg might indeed be supported by the rational, though falla- 
cious, hope that the pope, the king of Naples, and the Venetian republic 
would join in the defence of a free and Christian people, who guarded 
the sea-coast of the Adriatic and the narrow passage from Greece to 
Italy. His infant son was saved from the national shipwreck; the 
Castriots * 5 were invested with a Neapolitan dukedom, and their blood 
continues to flow in the noblest families of the realm. A colony of 
Albanian fugitives obtained a settlement in Calabria, and they pre- 
serve at this day the language and manners of their ancestors. 40 
In the long career of the decline and fall of the Roman empire, I 
have reached at length the last reign of the princes of Constantinople, 
who so feebly sustained the name and majesty of the Caesars. On the 
decease of John Palseologus, who survived about four years the Hun- 
garian crusade,* 7 the royal family, by the death of Andronicus and the 
monastic profession of Isidore, was reduced to three princes, Constan- 
tine, Demetrius, and Thomas, the surviving sons of the emperor Man- 
uel. Of these, the first and the last were far distant in the Morea; but 
Demetrius, who possessed the domain of Selymbria, was in the suburbs, 
at the head of a party; his ambition was not chilled by the public dis- 
tress, and his conspiracy with the Turks and the schismatics had al- 
ready disturbed the peace of his country. The funeral of the late 
emperor was accelerated with singular and even suspicious haste; the 
daim of Demetrius to the vacant throne was justified by a trite and 
flimsy sophism, that he was born in the purple, the eldest son of his 
father's reign. But the empress-mother, the senate and soldiers, the 
dergy and people, were unanimous in the cause of the lawful successor; 
and the despot Thomas, who, ignorant of the change, accidentally re- 
turned to the capital, asserted with becoming zeal the interest of his 
absent brother. An ambassador, the historian Phranza, was immedi- 
ately despatched to the court of Adrianople. Amurath received him 
with honour and dismissed him with gifts; but the gracious approba- 
tion of the Turkish sultan announced his supremacy, and the approach- 
ing downfall of the Eastern empire. By the hands of two illustrious 
deputies the Imperial crown was placed at Sparta on the head of 
Constantine. In the spring he sailed from the Morea, escaped the en- 
counter of a Turkish squadron, enjoyed the acclamations of his sub- 
jects, celebrated the festival of a new reign, and exhausted by his dona- 
tives the treasure, or rather the indigence, of the state. The emperor

" This colony of Albanese is mentioned by Mr. Swinburne (Travels into 
the Two Sicilies, voL i. p. 350-354)- 

41 The ^chronology of Phranza is dear and authentic; but instead of four 
years and seven months, Spondanus (A.D. 1445, No. 7) assigns seven or 
eight years to the reign of the last Constantine, which he deduces from a 
spurious epistle of Eugenius IV. to the king of ^Ethiopia. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 745 

immediately resigned to his brothers the possession of the Morea; and 
the brittle friendship of the two princes, Demetrius and Thomas, was 
confirmed in their mother's presence by the frail security of oaths and 
embraces. His next occupation was the choice of a consort. A daugh- 
ter of the doge of Venice had been proposed, but the Byzantine nobles 
objected the distance between an hereditary monarch and an elective 
magistrate; and in their subsequent distress the chief of that powerful 
republic was not unmindful of the affront. Constantine afterwards 
hesitated between the royal families of Trebizond and Georgia; and 
the embassy of Phranza represents in his public and private life the 
last days of the Byzantine empire. 48 

The protovestiare, or great chamberlain, Phranza, sailed from Con- 
stantinople as the minister of a bridegroom, and the relics of wealth and 
luxury were applied to his pompous appearance. His numerous retinue 
consisted of nobles and guards, of physicians and monks: he was at- 
tended by a band of music; and the term of his costly embassy was pro- 
tracted above two years. On his arrival in Georgia or Iberia the natives 
from the towns and villages flocked around the strangers; and such was 
their simplicity that they were delighted with the effects, without under- 
standing the cause, of musical harmony. Among the crowd was an old 
man, above a hundred years of age, who had formerly been carried 
away a captive by the barbarians, 48 and who amused his hearers with 
a tale of the wonders of India, 60 from whence he had returned to Portu- 
gal by an unknown sea. 61 From this hospitable land Phranza proceeded 
to the court of Trebizond, where he was informed by the Greek prince 
of the recent decease of Amurath. Instead of rejoicing in the deliver- 
ance, the experienced statesman expressed his apprehension that an

parents; on the fame of her beauty and merit she was recommended 
by the ambassador as the most worthy object of the royal choice; and 
Phranza recapitulates and refutes the specious objections that might be 
raised against the proposal. The majesty of the purple would ennoble 
an unequal alliance; the bar of affinity might be removed by liberal 
alms and the dispensation of the church; the disgrace of Turkish nup- 
tials had been repeatedly overlooked; and, though the fair Maria was 
near fifty years of age, she might yet hope to give an heir to the empire. 
Constantine listened to the advice, which was transmitted in the first 
ship that sailed from Trebizond; but the factions of the court opposed 
his marriage, and it was finally prevented by the pious vow of the 
sultana, who ended her days in the monastic profession. Reduced to 
the first alternative, the choice of Phranza was decided in favour of a 
Georgian princess; and the vanity of her father was dazzled by the 
glorious alliance. Instead of demanding, according to the primitive 
and national custom, a price for his daughter, 53 he offered a portion of 
fifty-six thousand, with an annual pension of five thousand, ducats; 
and the services of the ambassador were repaid by an assurance that, as 
his son had been adopted in baptism by the emperor, the establishment 
of, his daughter should be the peculiar care of the empress of Con- 
stantinople. On the return of Phranza the treaty was ratified by the 
Greek monarch, who with his own hand impressed three vermilion 
crosses on the golden bull, and assured the Georgian envoy that in the 
spring his galleys should conduct the bride to her Imperial palace. 
But Constantine embraced his faitihful servant, not with the cold ap- 
probation of a sovereign, but with the warm confidence of a friend, 
who, after a long absence, is impatient to pour his secrets into the 
bosom of his 'friend. " Since the death of my mother and of Cantacu- 
zene, who alone advised me without interest or passion, 54 I am sur- 
rounded," said the emperor, " by men whom I can neither love, nor 
trust, nor esteem. You are not a stranger to Lucas Notaras, the great 
admiral: obstinately attached to his own .sentiments, he declares, both 
in private and public,. that his sentiments are the absolute measure of 
my thoughts and actions. The rest of the courtiers are swayed by their 
personal or factious views; and how can I consult the moriks on ques- 
tions of policy and marriage? I have yet much employment for your 
diligence and fidelity. In the spring you shall engage one of my brothers 
to solicit the succour of the Western powers; from the Morea you shall 
sail to Cyprus on a particular commission, and frpm thence proceed to 
Georgia to receive and conduct the future empress." " Your commands," 
replied Phranza, " are irresistible; but deign, great sir," he added, with

of the queen of Servia, whom he visited, with the character of ambassador.

a serious smile, "to consider that, if I am thus perpetually absent from 
my family, my wife may be tempted either to seek another husband, or 
to throw herself into a monastery." After laughing at his apprehen- 
sions, the emperor more gravely consoled him by the pleasing assur- 
ance that this should be his last service abroad, and that he destined 
for his son a wealthy and noble heiress; for himself, the important office 
of great logothete, or principal minister of state. The marriage was im- 
mediately stipulated: but the office, however incompatible with his own, 
had been usurped by the ambition of the admiral. Some delay was 
requisite to negotiate a consent and an equivalent; and the nomination 
of Phranza was half declared and half suppressed, lest it might be dis- 
pleasing to an insolent and powerful favourite. The winter was spent 
in the preparations of his embassy; and Phranza had resolved that the 
youth his son should embrace this opportunity of foreign travel, and be 
left, on the appearance of danger, with his maternal kindred on the 
Morea. Such, were the private and public designs, which were inter- 
rupted by a Turkish war, and finally buried in the ruins of the empire.

THE siege of Constantinople by the Turks attracts our first attention to 
the person and character of the great destroyer. Mohammed the Sec- 
ond 1 was the son of the second Amurath; and though his mother has 
been decorated with the titles of Christian and princess, she is more 
probably confpunded with the numerous concubines who peopled from 
every climate the harem of the sultan. His first education and senti- 
ments were those of a devout Musulman; and as often as he conversed 
with an infidel he purified his hands and face by the legal rites of ablu- 
tion. Age and empire appear to have relaxed this narrow bigotry: His 
aspiring genius disdained to acknowledge a power above his own; and 
in his looser hours he presumed (it is said) to brand the prophet of 
Mecca as a robber and impostor. Yet the sultan persevered in a decent 
reverence for the doctrine and discipline of the- Koran: 2 his private in- 

1 For the character of ^ Mohammed II. it is dangerous to trust either 
the Turks or the Christians. The most moderate picture appears to be 
drawn by Phranza (1. i. c. 32 [p. 33, ed. -Bonn]), whose resentment ha&lt;3 
cooled in age and solitude. See likewise Spondanus (AJ\ 1451, No. u), an&lt;? 
the continuator of Fleury (torn. xxii. p.. 552), the Elogia of Paulus Joviua

a Cantemir (p.^ 115), and the mosques which he founded, attest his public 
regard for religion. Mohammed freely disputed with the patriarch Genna- 
dius on the two religions (Spond. A.D. 1453, No. 22)..

discretion must have been sacred from the vulgar ear; and we should 
suspect the credulity of strangers and sectaries, so prone to believe that 
a mind which is hardened against truth must be armed with superior 
contempt for absurdity and error. Under the tuition of the most skilful 
masters Mohammed advanced with an early and rapid progress in the 
paths of knowledge; and besides his native tongue it is affirmed that 
he spoke or understood five languages, 3 the Arabic, the Persian, the 
Chaldaean or Hebrew, the Latin, and the Greek. The Persian might 
indeed contribute to his amusement, and the Arabic to his edification: 
and such studies are familiar to the Oriental youth. In the interpourse 
of the Greeks and Turks a conqueror might wish to converse with the 
people over whom he was ambitious to reign: his own praises in Latin 
poetry 4 or prose 5 might find a passage to the royal ear; but what use 
or merit could recommend to the statesman or the scholar the uncouth 
dialect of his Hebrew slaves? The history and geography of the 
world were familiar to his memory: the lives of the heroes of the East, 
perhaps of the West, 6 excited his emulation: his skill in astrology is 
excused by the folly of the times, and supposes some rudiments of math- 
ematical science; and a profane taste for the arts is betrayed in his 
liberal invitation and reward of the painters of Italy. 1 But the influ- 
ence of religion and learning were employed without effect on his savage 
and licentious nature. I will not transcribe, nor do I firmly believe, the 
stories of his fourteen pages whose bellies were ripped open in search of 
a stolen melon, or of the beauteous slave whose head he severed from 

'Quinque linguas praeter suam noverat, Graecam, Latinam, Chaldaicam, 
Persicam. The Latin translator of Phranza has dropped the Arabic, which 
the Koran must recommend to every Musulman. 

* Philelphus, by a Latin ode, requested and obtained the liberty of his 
wife's mother and sisters from the conqueror of Constantinople. It was 
delivered into the sultan's hands by the envoys of the duke of Milan. 
Philelphus himself was suspected of a design of retiring to Constantinople; 
yet the orator often sounded the trumpet of holy war (see his Life by 
M. Lancelot, in the Memoires de I'Academie des Inscriptions, torn. x. p. 718 
724, etc.). 

8 Robert Valturio published at Verona, in 1483, his twelve books de Re 
Militari, in which he first mentions the use of bombs. By his patron 
Sigismond Malatesta, prince of Rimini, it had been addressed with a Latin 
epistle to Mohammed II. 

* According to Phranza, he assiduously studied the lives and actions of 
Alexander, Augustus, Constantine, and Theodosius. I have read some- 
where that Plutarch's Lives were translated by his orders into the Turkish 
language. If the sultan himself understood Greek, it must have been for 
the benefit of his subjects. Yet these Lives are a school of freedom as 
well as of valour. 

7 The .famous Gentile Bellino, whom he had invited from Venice, was 
dismissed with a chain and collar of gold and a purse of 3000 ducats. With 
Voltaire I laugh at the foolish story of a slave purposely beheaded to 
instruct the painter In the action of the muscles.

Johnson in his "Irene," which is the least satisfactory of the great lexi-

her body to convince the Janizaries that their master was not the votary 
of love. His sobriety is attested by the silence of the Turkish annals, 
which accuse three, and three only, of the Ottoman line of the vice of 
drunkenness. 8 But it cannot be denied that his passions were at once 
furious and inexorable; that in the palace, as in the field, a torrent of 
blood was spilt on the slightest provocation; and that the noblest of the 
captive youth were often dishonoured by his unnatural lust. In the 
Albanian war he studied the lessons, and soon surpassed the example, 
of his father; and the conquest of two empires, twelve kingdoms, and 
two hundred cities, a vain and flattering account, is ascribed to his 
invincible sword. He was doubtless a soldier, and possibly a general; 
Constantinople has sealed his glory; but if we compare the means, the 
obstacles, and the achievements, Mohammed the Second must blush to 
sustain a parallel with Alexander or Timour. Under his command the 
Ottoman forces were always more numerous than their enemies, yet 
their progress was bounded by the Euphrates and the Adriatic, and his 
arms were checked by Huniades and Scanderbeg, by the Rhodian 
knights, and by the Persian king. 

In the reign of Amurath he twice tasted of royalty, and twice de- 
scended from the throne: his tender age was incapable of opposing his 
father's restoration, but never could he forgive the vizirs who had rec* 
ommended that salutary measure. His nuptials were celebrated with 
the daughter of a Turkman emir; and, after a festival of two months, 
he departed from Adrianople with his bride to reside in the government 
of Magnesia. Before the end of six weeks he was recalled by a sudden 
message from the divan which announced the decease of Amurath and 
the mutinous spirit of the Janizaries. His speed and vigour commanded 
their obedience: he passed the Hellespont with a chosen guard: and at 
the distance of a mile from Adrianople the vizirs and emirs, the imams 
and cadhis, the soldiers and the people, fell prostrate before the new 
sultan. They affected to weep, they affected to rejoice: he ascended 
the throne at the age of twenty-one years, and removed the cause of 
sedition by the death, the inevitable death, of his infant brothers.* 
The ambassadors of Europe and Asia soon appeared to congratulate 
his accession and solicit his friendship, and to all he spoke the language 
of moderation and peace. The confidence of the Greek emperor was 
revived by the solemn oaths and fair assurances with which he sealed 
the ratification of the treaty: and a rich domain on the banks of the 
Strymon was assigned for the annual payment of three hundred thou- 

* These Imperial drunkards were Soliman I., Selim IL, and Amurath 
IV. (Cantemir, p. 61). The sophis of Persia can produce a more regular 
succession; and in the last age our European travellers were the witnesses 
and companions of their revels. 

"Calapin, one of these royal infants, was saved from his cruel brother, 
and baptised at Rome under the name of Callistus Othomannus. The 
emperor ^ Frederic III. presented him with an estate in Austria, where he 
ended his life; and Cuspinian, who in his youth conversed with the aged 
prince at Yieizaa, applauds his piety and wisdom (de Caesaribus, p. 672, 673),

sand aspers, the pension of an Ottoman prince who was detained at his 
request in the Byzantine court. Yet the neighbours of Mohammed 
might tremble at the severity with which a youthful monarch reformed 
the pomp of his father's household: the expenses of luxury were applied 
to those of ambition, and a useless train of seven thousand falconers 
was either dismissed from his service or enlisted in his troops. In the 
first summer of his reign he visited with an army the Asiatic provinces; 
but after humbling the pride Mohammed accepted the submission of 
the Caramanian, that he might not be diverted by the smallest ob- 
stacle from the execution of his great design. 10 

The Mohammedan, and more especially the Turkish casuists, have 
pronounced that no promise can bind the faithful against the interest 
and duty of their religion, and that the sultan may abrogate his own 
treaties and those of his predecessors. The justice and magnanimity 
of Amurath had scorned this immoral privilege; but his son, though 
the proudest of men, could stoop from ambition to the basest arts of 
dissimulation and deceit. Peace was on his lips while war was in his 
heart: he incessantly sighed for the possession of Constantinople; and 
the Greeks, by their own indiscretion, afforded the first pretence of the 
fatal rupture. 11 ; Instead of labouring to be forgotten, their ambassa- 
dors pursued his camp to demand the payment, and even the increase, 
of their annual stipend: the divan was importuned by their complaints; 
and the vizir, a secret friend of the Christians, was constrained to de- 
liver the sense of his brethren. " Ye foolish and miserable Romans," 
said Calil, " we know your devices, and ye are ignorant of your own 
danger! the scrupulous Amurath is no more; his throne is occupied by 
a young conqueror whom no laws can bind, and no obstacles can resist: 
and if you escape from his hands, give praise to the divine clemency,

L iii. c. 2), Chalcocondyles , (L vii. p. 199 [p. 376, ed, Bonn]), and Cantemir 
(p. 06). 

u Before I enter on the siege of Constantinople I shall observe that, 
except the short hints of Cantemir and Leunclavius, I have not been ' able 
to obtain any Turkish account of this conquest such an account as we 
possess of the siege of -Rhodes by Soliman II, (M&amp;noires de 1'Academie des 
Inscriptions, torn. xxvi. p. 723-769). I, must .therefore depend on the Greeks, 
whose prejudices, in some degree, are subdued by their distress. Our 
standard texts are those of Ducas (c. 34-42), Phranza (1. iii. c. 7-20), 
Chalcocondyles (1. viii. p. 201-214 [p- 380-403, ed. Bonn]), and Leonardus 
Chiensis (Historia C. P. a Turco expugnatse; Norimberghae, 1544, in 4to, 
20 leaves). The last of these narratives is the earliest in date, since it was 
composed in the isle of Chios, the'i6th of August, 1453, only seventy-nine 
days after the loss of the city, and in the first confusion of ideas and 
passions. Some hints may be added from an epistle of Cardinal Isidore 
(in Farragine Rerum Turcicarum, ad calcem Chalcocondyl. Clauseri, Basil, 
1556) to Pope Nicholas V., and a tract of Theodosius Zygomala, which he 
addressed in the year 1581 to Martin Crusius (Turco-Graecia, L i. p. 74-98, 
Basil, 1584). The various facts and materials are briefly, though critically, 
reviewed by Spondanus (A.D. 1453, 'No. 1-27). The hearsay relations of 
Monstrelet and the. distant Latins I shall take leave to disregard.

which yet delays the chastisement of your sins. Why do you seek to 
affright us by vain and indirect menaces? Release the fugitive Orchan, 
crown him sultan of Romania, call the Hungarians from beyond the 
Danube, arm against us the nations of the West, and be assured that 
you will only provoke and precipitate your ruin." But if the fears of 
the ambassadors were alarmed by the stern language of the vizir, they 
were soothed by the courteous audience and friendly speeches of the 
Ottoman prince; and Mohammed assured them that on his return to 
Adrianople he would redress the grievances, and consult the true inter- 
ests of the Greeks. No sooner had he repassed the Hellespont than 
he issued a mandate to suppress their pension, and to expel their officers 
from the banks of the Strymon: in this measure he betrayed a hostile 
mind; and the second order announced, and in some degree commenced, 
the siege of Constantinople. In the narrow pass of the Bosphorus an 
Asiatic fortress had formerly been raised by his grandfather; in the 
opposite situation, on the European side, he resolved to erect a more 
formidable castle, and a thousand masons were commanded to assemble 
in the spring on a spot named Asomaton, about five miles from the Greek 
metropolis. 12 Persuasion is the, resource of the feeble; and the feeble 
can seldom persuade: the. ambassadors of the emperor attempted, with- 
out success, to divert Mohammed from the execution of his design. 
They represented that his grandfather had solicited the permission of 
Manuel to build a castle on his own territories; but that this double 
fortification, which would command the strait, could only tend to vio- 
late the alliance of the nations, to intercept lie Latins who traded in 
the Black Sea, and perhaps to annihilate the subsistence of the city. 
" I form no enterprise," replied the perfidious sultan, " against the city; 
but the empire of Constantinople is measured by her walls. Have you 
forgot the distress to which my father was reduced when you formed a 
league with the Hungarians, when they invaded our country by land, 
and the Hellespont was occupied by the French galleys? Amurath was 
compelled to force the passage of the Bosphorus; and your strength 
was not equal to your malevolence. I was then a child at Adrianople; 
the Moslems trembled, and for a while the Gabours 18 insulted our dis- 
grace. But when my father had triumphed in the field of Varna, he 
vowed to erect a fort on the western shore, and that vow it is my duty tc 

B The situation of the fortress and the topography of the Bosphorus are 
best learned from Peter Gyllius (de Bosphoro Thracio, 1. ii. c. 13), Leim- 
clavius (Pandect p. 445), and Tournefort (Voyage dans le Levant, torn. n. 
lettre xv, p. 443, 444) ; but I must regret the map or plan which Tournefort 
sent to the French minister of the marine. The reader may turn back to 
chap. xvii. of this History. . 

"The opprobrious name which the Turks bestow on the infidels is ex- 
pressed Ka0ov/&gt; by Ducas, and Giaour by Leunclavius and the moderns. 
The former term is derived by Ducange (Gloss. Graec. torn. i. p: 530) fronv 
KaBovpov, in vulgar Greek a tortoise, as denoting a retrograde motion from 
the faith. But, alas! Gabour is no more than Gheber, which was trans- 
ferred from the Persian to the Turkish language, from the worshippers of 
fire to those of the crucifix (D'Herbelot, Biblioth. Orient p. 375).

accomplish. Have ye the right, have ye the power, to control my 
actions on my own ground? For that ground is my own: as far as the 
shores of the Bosphorus Asia is inhabited by the Turks, and Europe is 
deserted by the Romans. Return, and inform your king that the pres- 
ent Ottoman is far different from his predecessors, that his resolutions 
surpass their wishes, and that he performs more than they could resolve. 
Return in safety; but the next who delivers a similar message may 
expect to be flayed alive." After this declaration, Constantme, the 
first of the Greeks in spirit as in rank, 14 had determined to unsheathe 
the sword, and to resist the approach and establishment of the Turks on 
the Bosphorus. He was disarmed by the advice of his civil and eccle- 
siastical ministers, who recommended a system less generous, and even 
less prudent, than his own, to approve their patience and long-suffering, 
to brand the Ottoman with the name and guilt of an aggressor, and to 
depend on chance and time for their own safety, and the destruction 
of a fort which could not long be maintained in the neighbourhood of 
a great and populous city. Amidst hope and fear, the fears of the 
wise and the hopes of the credulous, the winter rolled away; the proper 
business of each man and each hour was postponed; and the Greeks 
shut their eyes against the impending danger, till the arrival of the 
spring and the sultan decided the assurance of their ruin. 

Of a master who never forgives, the orders are seldom disobeyed. On 
the twenty-sixth of March the appointed spot of Asomaton was cov- 
ered with an active swarm of Turkish artificers; and the materials by 
sea and land were diligently transported from Europe and Asia. 15 The 
lime had been burnt in Cataphrygia, the timber was cut down in the 
woods of Heraclea and Nicomedia, and the stones were dug from the 
Anatolian quarries. Each of the thousand masons was assisted by two 
workmen; and a measure of two cubits was marked for their daily 
task. The fortress 16 was built in a triangular form; each angle was 
flanked by a strong and massy tower, one on the declivity of the hill, 
two along the sea-shore; a thickness of twenty-two feet was assigned 
for the walls, thirty for the towers; and the whole building was covered 
with a solid platform of lead. Mohammed himself pressed and directed 
the work with indefatigable ardour: his three vizirs claimed the hon- 
our of finishing their respective towers; the zeal of the cadhis emu- 
lated that of the Janizaries; the meanest labour was ennobled by the

^Instead of this clear and consistent account, the Turkish Annals (Cante- 
mir, p. 97) revived the foolish tale of the ox's hide, and Dido's stratagem 
in the foundation of Carthage. These annals (unless we are swayed by 
an anti-Christian prejudice) are far less valuable than the Greek historians.

service of God and the sultan; and the diligence of the multitude was 
quickened by the eye of a despot whose smile was the hope of fortune, 
and whose frown was the messenger of death. The Greek emperor 
beheld with terror the irresistible progress of the work, and vainly 
strove by flattery and gifts to assuage an implacable foe, who sought, 
and secretly fomented, the slightest occasion of a quarrel. Such occa- 
sions must soon and inevitably be found. The ruins of stately churches, 
and even the marble columns which had been consecrated to Saint 
Michael the archangel, were employed without scruple by the profane 
and rapacious Moslems; and some Christians, who presumed to oppose 
the removal, received from their hands the crown of martyrdom. Con- 
stantine had solicited a Turkish guard to protect the fields and harvests 
of his subjects: the guard was fixed; but their first order was to allow 
free pasture to the mules and horses of the camp, and to defend their 
brethren if they should be molested by the natives. The retinue of an 
Ottoman chief had left their horses to pass the night among the ripe 
corn: the damage was felt, the insult was resented, and several of both 
nations were slain in a tumultuous conflict. Mohammed listened with 
joy to the complaint; and a detachment was commanded to exterminate 
the guilty village: the guilty had fled; but forty innocent and unsus- 
pecting reapers were massacred by the soldiers. Till this provocation 
Constantinople had been open to the visits of commerce and curiosity: 
on the first alarm the gates were shut; but the emperor, still anxious 
for peace, released on the third day his Turkish captives, 17 and ex- 
pressed, in a last message, the firm resignation of a Christian and a sol- 
dier. " Since neither oaths, nor treaty, nor submission can secure peace, 
pursue," said he to Mohammed, " your impious warfare. My trust is in 
God alone: if it should please him to mollify your heart, I shall rejoice 
in the happy change; if he delivers the city into your hands, I submit 
without a murmur to his holy will. But until the Judge of the earth 
shall pronounce between us, it is my duty to live and die in the defence 
of my people." The sultan's answer was hostile and decisive: his forti- 
fications were completed; and before his departure for Adrianople he 
stationed a vigilant Aga and four hundred Janizaries to levy a tribute 
on the ships of every nation that should pass, within the reach of their 
cannon. A Venetian vessel, refusing obedience to the new lords of the 
Bosphorus, was sunk with a single bullet. The master and thirty 
sailors escaped in the boat; but they were dragged in chains to the 
Porte: the chief was impaled, his companions were beheaded; and the 
historian Ducas 18 beheld, at Demotica, their bodies exposed to the 
wild beasts. The siege of Constantinople was deferred till the ensuing 
spring; but an Ottoman army marched into the Morea to divert the

exorable rigour, that they begged to lose their heads in the city unless they 
could return before sunset.

force of the brothers of Constantine. At this era of calamity one ot 
these princes, the despot Thomas, was blessed or afflicted wi(h the 
birth of a son " tie last heir," says the plaintive Phranza, " of the 
last spark of the Roouan empire." 19 

The Greeks and tier Turks passed an anxious and sleepless winter: 
the former TOTC kept -awake by their fears, the latter by their hopes; 
both by the preparations of defence and attack; and the two emperors, 
who had the most to 1 ose or to gain, were the most deeply affected by 
the national sentiment, In Mohammed that sentiment was inflamed 
by the ardour of Ms youth and temper: he amused his leisure with 
building at Adrianople io the lofty palace of Jehan Numa (the watch- 
tower of the world); but his serious thoughts were irrevocably bent 
on the conquest of the= city of Csesar. At the dead of night, about the 
second watch, he started from his bed, and commanded the instant at- 
tendance of his prime vizir. The message, the hour, the prince, and 
his own situation, alarrmed the guilty conscience of Calil Basha; who 
had possessed the confidence, and advised the restoration, of Amurath. 
On the accession of the son the vizir was confirmed in his office and the 
appearances of favour ; but the veteran statesman was not insensible 
that he trod on a tbiin and slippery ice, which might break under 
his footsteps and pliiinge him in the abyss. His friendship for the 
Christians, which migfcitbe innocent under the late reign, had stigma- 
tised him with the name of Gabour Ortachi, or foster-brother of the in- 
fidels; 21 and his avarice entertained a venal and treasonable correspond- 
ence, which was detected and punished after the conclusion of the war. 
On receiving the rajd mandate, he embraced, perhaps for the last time, 
his wife and children; filled a cup with pieces of gold, hastened to the 
palace, adored the suLtan, and offered, according to the Oriental cus- 
tom, the slight tribute of bus duty and gratitude. 22 " It is not my wish," 
said Mohammed, " to aresume my gifts, but rather to heap and multiply 
them on thy head. Iim ray turn I ask a present far more ..valuable and 
important Constantinople," As soon as the vizir had recovered from 
bis surprise, " The sanae God," said he, " who has already given thee 
so large a portion of the Roman empire, will not deny the remnant and 
the capital. His providence, and thy power, assure thy success; and

myself, with the rest of thy faithful slaves, will sacrifice our lives and 
fortunes."" Lala " 23 (or preceptor), continued the sultan, " do you 
see this pillow? all the night, in my agitation, I have pulled it on one 
side and the other; I have risen from my bed, again have I lain down, 
yet sleep has not visited these weary eyes. Beware of the gold and 
silver of the Romans: in arms we are superior; and with the aid .01 
God, and the prayers of the prophet, we shall speedily become masters 
of Constantinople." To sound the disposition of his soldiers, he oftei- 
wandered through the streets alone and in disguise; and it was fatal 
to discover the sultan when he wished to escape from the vulgar eye. 
His hours were spent in delineating the plan of the hostile city; in de- 
bating with his generals and engineers on what spot he should erect his 
batteries; on which side he should assault the walls; where he should 
spring his mines; to what place he should apply his. scaling-ladders: 
and the exercises of the day repeated and proved the lucubrations of 
the night. 

Among the implements of destnictior, he studied with peculiar care 
the recent and tremendous discovery of the Latins; and his artillery 
surpassed whatever had yet appeared in the world. A founder of can- 
non, a Dane 24 or Hungarian, who had been almost starved in the Greek 
service, deserted to the Moslems, and was liberally entertained by the 
Turkish sultan. Mohammed was satisfied with the answer to his first 
question, which he eagerly pressed on the artist. " Am I able to cast a 
cannon capable of throwing a ball or stone of sufficient size to batter 
the walls of Constantinople? I am not ignorant of their strength; but 
were they more solid than those of Babylon, I could oppose an engine 
of superior power; the position and management of that engine must 
be left to your engineers." On this assurance a foundry was established 
at Adrianople: the metal. was prepared; and at the end of three months 
Urban produced a piece of brass ordnance of stupendous and almost 
incredible magnitude; a measure of twelve palms is assigned to the 
bore; and the stone bullet weighed above six hundred pounds. 25 A va- 
cant place before the new palace was chosen for the first experiment; 
but to prevent the sudden and mischievous effects of astonishment and

"The Attic talent weighed about sixty minae, or avoirdupois pounds (see 
Hooper on Ancient Weights, Measures, etc.) ; but among titie modern Greeks 
that classic appellation was extended to a weight of one' hundred, or one 
hundred and twenty-five pounds (Ducange, rdXavrov}. Leonardus Chiensis

fear, a proclamation was issued that the cannon would be discharged 
the ensuing day. The explosion was felt or heard in a circuit of a 
hundred furlongs: the ball, by the force of gunpowder, was driven 
above a mile; and on the spot where it fell, it buried itself a fathom 
deep in the ground. For the conveyance of this destructive engine, a 
frame or carriage of thirty waggons was linked together and drawn 
along by a team of sixty oxen: two hundred men on both sides were 
stationed to poise and support the rolling weight; two hundred and 
fifty workmen marched before to smooth the way and repair the 
bridges; and near two months were employed hi a laborious journey of 
one hundred and fifty miles. A lively philosopher 26 derides on this 
occasion the credulity of the Greeks, and observes, with much reason, 
that we should always distrust the exaggerations of a vanquished peo- 
ple. He calculates that a ball, even of two hundred pounds, would re- 
quire a charge of one hundred and fifty pounds of powder; and that 
the stroke would be feeble and impotent, since not a fifteenth part of 
the mass could be inflamed at the same moment. A stranger as I am 
to the art of destruction, I can discern that the modern improvements 
of artillery prefer the number of pieces to the weight of metal; the 
quickness of the fire to the sound, or even the consequences, of a single 
explosion. Yet I dare not reject the positive and unanimous evidence 
of contemporary writers; nor can it seem improbable that the first 
artists, in then* rude and ambitious efforts, should have transgressed the 
standard of moderation. A Turkish cannon, more enormous than that 
of Mohammed, still guards the entrance of the Dardanelles; and if the 
use be inconvenient, it has been found on a late trial that the effect was 
far from contemptible. A stone bullet of eleven hundred pounds' weight 
was once discharged with three hundred and thirty pounds of powder: 
at the distance of six hundred yards it shivered into three rocky frag- 
ments; traversed the strait; and, leaving the waters in a foam, again 
rose and bounded against the opposite hill. 27 

While Mohammed threatened the capital of the East, the Greek em- 
peror implored with fervent prayers the assistance of earth and Heaven. 
But the invisible powers were deaf to his supplications; and Christen- 
dom beheld with indifference the fall of Constantinople, while she de- 
rived at least some promise of supply from the jealous and temporal 
policy of the sultan of Egypt. Some states were too weak, and others 
too remote; by some the danger was considered as imaginary, by others 
as inevitable: the Western princes were involved in their endless and 
domestic quarrels; and the Roman pontiff was exasperated by the false- 
hood or obstinacy of the Greeks. Instead of employing in their favour

the arms and treasures of Italy, Nicholas the Fifth had foretold their 
approaching ruin; and his honour was engaged in the accomplishment 
of his prophecy. Perhaps he was softened by the last extremity of 
their distress; but his compassion was tardy; his efforts were faint and 
unavailing; and Constantinople had fallen before the squadrons of 
Genoa and Venice could sail from their harbours. 28 Even the princes, 
of the Morea and of the Greek islands affected a cold neutrality: the 
Genoese colony of Galata negotiated a private treaty; and the sultan 
indulged them in the delusive hope that by his clemency they might 
survive the ruin of the empire. A plebeian crowd and some Byzantine 
nobles basely withdrew from the danger of their country; and the 
avarice of the rich denied the emperor, and reserved for the Turks, the 
secret treasures which might have raised in their defence whole armies 
of mercenaries. 39 The indigent and solitary prince prepared however 
to sustain his formidable adversary; but if his courage were equal to 
the peril, his strength was inadequate to the contest. In the beginning 
of the spring the Turkish vanguard swept the towns and villages as far 
as the gates of Constantinople: submission was spared and protected; 
whatever presumed to resist was exterminated with fire and sword. The 
Greek places on the Black Sea, Mesembria, Acheloum, and Bizon, sur- 
rendered on the first summons; Selymbria alone deserved the honours 
of a siege or blockade; and the bold inhabitants, while they were in- 
vested by land, launched their boats, pillaged the opposite coast of 
Cyzicus, and sold their captives in the public market. But on the ap- 
proach of Mohammed himself all was silent and prostrate: ,he first 
halted at the distance of five miles; and, from thence advancing in 
battle array, planted before the gate of St. Romanus the Imperial 
standard; and on the sixth day of April formed the memorable siege 
of Constantinople. 

The troops of Asia and Europe extended on the right and left from 
the Propontis to the harbour; the Janizaries in the front were stationed 
before the sultan's tent; the Ottoman line was covered by a deep in- 
trenchment; and a subordinate army enclosed the suburb of Galata, 
and watched the doubtful faith of the Genoese. The inquisitive Phi- 
lelphus, who resided in Greece about thirty years before the siege, is 
confident that all the Turkish forces of any name or value could not ex-

ceed the number of sixty thousand torse and twenty thousand foot; and 
he upbraids the pusillanimity of the nations who had tamely yielded 
to a handful of barbarians. Such indeed might be the regular estab- 
lishment of the Capiculi the troops of the Porte who marched with 
the prince, and were paid from his royal treasury. But the bashaws, 
in their respective governments, maintained or levied a provincial mi- 
litia; many lands were held by a military tenure; many volunteers 
were attracted by the hope of spoil; and the sound of the holy trumpet 
invited a swarm of hungry and fearless fanatics, who might contribute 
at least to multiply the terrors, and in a first attack to blunt the swords 
of the Christians. The whole mass of the Turkish powers is magnified 
by Ducas, Chalcocondyles, and Leonard of Chios, to the amount of 
three or four hundred thousand men; but Phranza was a less remote 
and more accurate judge; and his precise definition of two hundred and 
fifty-eight thousand does not exceed the measure of experience and 
probability.* 1 The navy of the besiegers was less formidable: the Pro- 
pontis was overspread with three hundred and twenty sail; but of these 
no more than eighteen could be rated as galleys of war; and the far 
greater part must be degraded to the condition of store-ships and trans- 
ports, which poured into the camp fresh supplies of men, ammunition, 
and provisions. In her last decay Constantinople was still, peopled with 
more than a hundred thousand inhabitants; but these numbers are 
found in the accounts, not of war, but of captivity; and they mostly 
consisted of mechanics, of priests, of women, and of men devoid of that 
spirit which even women have sometimes exerted for the common safety. 
I can suppose, I could almost excuse, the reluctance of subjects to 
serve on a distant frontier, at the will of a tyrant; but the man who 
dares not expose his life in the defence of his children and his property 
has lost in society the first and most active energies of nature. By 
the emperor's command a particular inquiry hp-d been made through 
the streets and houses, how many of the citizens, or even of the monks, 
were able and willing to bear arms for their country. The lists were 
intrusted to Phranza; 32 and after a diligent addition he informed his 

*The palatine troops are styled CapicaK; the provincials, Seratculi; and 
most of the names and institutions of the Turkish militia existed before 
the Canon Nameh of Soliman II., from which, and his own experience, 
Count Marsigli has composed his Military State of the Ottoman Empire. 

81 The observation of Philelphus is approved by Cuspinian in the year 
1508 (de Caesaribus, in Epilog. de Militia Turcica, p. 697). . Marsigli proves 
that the effective armies of the Turks are much less numerous than they 
appear. In the army that besieged Constantinople Leonardus Chiensis 
reckons no more than 15,000 Janizaries. 

[The estimates made by various writers as to the numbers of the forces 
which Mohammed II. brought up against Constantinople are almost ludicrously 
divergent. Suffice to say they vary from 160,000 to 450,000 men. One 
fact should be noted, that a large number of Christians fought on the 
side of the Turks. O. S.]

master, with grief and surprise, that the national defence was reduced 
to four thousand nine hundred and seventy Romans. Between Con- 
stantine and his faithful minister this comfortless secret was preserved; 
and a sufficient proportion of shields, cross-bows, and muskets, was 
distributed from the arsenal to the city bands. They derived some 
accession from a body of two thousand strangers, under the command 
of John Justiniani, a noble Genoese; a liberal donative was advanced 
to these auxiliaries; and a princely recompense, the isle of Lemnos, 
was promised to the valour and victory of their chief. A strong chain 
was drawn across the mouth of the harbour: it was supported by some 
Greek and Italian vessels of war and merchandise; and the ships of 
every Christian nation, that successively arrived from Candia and the 
Black Sea, were detained for the public service. Against the powers 
of the Ottoman empire, a city of the extent of thirteen, perhaps of six- 
teen, miles was defended by a scanty garrison of seven or eight thou- 
sand soldiers. Europe and Asia were open to the besiegers; but the 
strength and provisions of the Greeks must sustain a daily decrease; 
nor could they indulge the expectation of any foreign succour or 
supply. 38 

The primitive Romans would have drawn their swords in the reso- 
lution of death or conquest. The primitive Christians might have em- 
braced each other, and awaited in patience and charity the stroke of 
martyrdom. But the Greeks of Constantinople were animated only by 
the spirit of religion, and that spirit was productive only of animosity 
and discord. Before his death the emperor John Palaeologus had re- 
nounced the unpopular measure of a union with the Latins; nor was 
the idea revived till the distress of his brother Constantine imposed a 
last trial of flattery and dissimulation. 34 With the demand of temporal 
aid his ambassadors were instructed to mingle the assurance of spiritual 
obedience: his neglect of the church was excused by the urgent cares 
of the state; and his orthodox wishes solicited the presence of a Roman 

desire a more authentic witness, not only of public facts, but of private 
counsels. 

** [The Turks had a tremendous task before them in undertaking the 
siege of Constantinople. It must not be imagined that the enterprise was 
at all an easy one. The defences were enormously, strong. From the 
fourth century onward almost every century saw some one of the emperors 
strengthening the fortifications. For example, at the time of the Avar 
siege, Heraclius had strengthened the palace of Blachern on the west by a 
new wall running between the Tower of Anemas and the Xyloporta; while 
Leo V. erected another wall outside the wall of Heraclius. Then, as Bury 
points out, in the twelfth century Manuel Comnenus built a wall enclosing 
the quarter called the Caligaria, from the Tower of Anemas to the Xylo- 
kerkos. Then the siege of Constantinople in 1432 by Murad caused John 
Palaeologus to repair and strengthen the whole of the outer line of wall.

84 In Spondanus the narrative of the union is not only partial, but im- 
perfect. , The bishop of Pamiers died in 1645, and the history of Ducas, 
which represents these scenes (c. 36, 37) with such truth and spirit, was 
not printed till the year 1649. 



76o THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

legate. The Vatican had been too often deluded; yet the signs of re- 
pentance could not decently be overlooked; a legate was more easily 
granted than an army; and about six months before the final destruc- 
tion, the cardinal Isidore of Russia appeared in that character with a 
retinue of priests and soldiers. The emperor saluted him as a friend 
and father; respectfully listened to his public and private sermons; 
and with the most obsequious of the clergy and laymen subscribed the 
act of union, as it had been ratified in the council of Florence. On 
the twelfth of December the two nations, in the church of St. Sophia, 
joined in the communion of sacrifice and prayer; and the names of the 
two pontiffs were solemnly commemorated; the names of Nicholas the 
Fifth, the vicar of Christ, and of the patriarch Gregory, who had been 
driven into exile by a rebellious people. 

But the dress and language of the Latin priest who officiated at the 
altar were an object of scandal; and it was observed with horror that 
he consecrated a cake or wafer of unleavened bread, and poured cold 
water into the cup of the sacrament. A national historian acknowledges 
with a blush that none of his countrymen, not the emperor himself, 
were sincere in this occasional conformity. 86 Their hasty and uncon- 
ditional submission was palliated by a promise of future revisal; but 
the best, or the worst, of their excuses was the confession of their own 
perjury. When they were pressed by the reproaches of their honest 
brethren, " Have patience," they whispered, " have patience till God 
shall have delivered the city from the great dragon who seeks to devour 
us. You shall then perceive whether we are truly reconciled with the 
Azymites." But patience is not the attribute of zeal; nor can the arts 
of a court be adapted to the freedom and violence of popular enthusi- 
asm. From the dome of St. Sophia the inhabitants of either sex, and 
of every degree, rushed in crowds to the cell of the monk Gennadius, 36 
to consult the oracle of the church. The holy man was invisible; en- 
tranced, as it should seem, in deep meditation, or divine rapture: but 
he had exposed on the door of his cell a speaking tablet; and they suc- 
cessively withdrew, after reading these tremendous words: " O miser- 
able Romans, why will ye abandon the truth; and why, instead of con- 
fiding in God, will ye put your trust in the Italians? In losing your 
faith you will lose your city. Have mercy on me, Lord! I protest 
in thy presence that I am innocent of the crime. miserable Romans,

**Phranza, one of the conforming Greeks, acknowledges that the measure 
was adopted only propter spem auxilii; he affirms with pleasure that those 
who refused to perform their devotions in St. Sophia, extra culpam et in 
pace essent (1. iii. c. 20). 

M His primitive and secular name was George Scholarius, which he changed 
for that of Gennadius, either when he became a monk or a patriarch. 
His defence, at Florence, of the same union which he so furiously attacked 
at Constantinople, has tempted Leo Allatius (Diatrib. de Georgiis, in Fabric. 
Biblioth. Grace, torn. x. p. 760-786) to divide him into two men; but 
Rcnaudot (p. 343-383) has restored the identity of his person and the 
duplicity of his character.

the religion of your fathers, by embracing impiety, you submit to a for- 
eign servitude." According to the advice of Gennadius, the religious 
virgins, as pure as angels, and as proud as demons, rejected the act of 
union, and abjured all communion with the present and future asso- 
ciates of the Latins; and their example was applauded and imitated 
by the greatest part of the clergy and people. From the monastery tht 
devout Greeks dispersed themselves in the taverns; drank confusion to 
the slaves of the pope; emptied their glasses in honour of the image of 
the holy Virgin; and besought her to defend against Mohammed the 
city which she had formerly saved from Chosroes and the Chagan. 
In the double intoxication of zeal and wine, they valiantly exclaimed, 
" What occasion have we for succour, or union, or Latins? far from us 
be the worship of the Azymitesl " During the winter that preceded the 
Turkish conquest the nation was distracted by this epidemical frenzy; 
and the season of Lent, the approach of Easter, instead of breathing 
charity and love, served only to fortify the obstinacy and influence of 
the zealots. The confessors scrutinised and alarmed the conscience of 
their votaries, and a rigorous penance was imposed on those who had 
received the communion from a priest who had given an express or tacit 
consent to the union. His service at the altar propagated the infection 
to the mute and simple spectators of the ceremony: they forfeited, by 
the impure spectacle, the virtue of the sacerdotal character; nor was it 
lawful, even in danger of sudden death, to invok^ the assistance of 
their prayers or absolution. No sooner had the church of St. Sophia 
been polluted by the Latin sacrifice than it was deserted as a Jewish 
synagogue, or a heathen temple, by the clergy and people; and a vast 
and gloomy silence prevailed in that venerable dome, which had so 
often smoked with a cloud of incense, blazed with innumerable lights, 
and resounded with the voice of prayer and thanksgiving. The Latins 
were the most odious of heretics and infidels; and the first minister of 
the empire, the great duke, was heard to declare that he had rather 
behold in Constantinople the turban of Mohammed than the pope's 
tiara or a cardinal's hat. 37 A sentiment so unworthy of Christians and 
patriots was familiar and fatal to the Greeks: the emperor was deprived 
of the affection and support of his subjects; and their native cowardice 
was sanctified by resignation to the divine decree or the visionary hope 
of a miraculous deliverance. 

Of the triangle which composes the figure of Constantinople the two 
sides along the sea were made inaccessible to an enemy; the Propontis 
by nature, and the harbour by art. Between the two waters, the basis 
of the triangle, the land side was protected by a double wall and a deep 
ditch of the depth of one hundred feet. Against this line of fortifica- 
tion, which Phranza, an eye-witness, prolongs to the measure of six 
miles, 88 the Ottomans directed their principal attack; and the emperor, 

8T *a/u&lt;$Xoi&gt;, icAXvirrpa, may be fairly translated a cardinal's hat. The 
difference of the Greek and Latin habits embittered the schism.

after distributing the service and command of the most perilous sta- 
tions, undertook the defence of the external wall. In the first days of 
the siege the Greek soldiers descended into the ditch, or sallied into the 
field; but they soon discovered that, in the proportion of their numbers, 
one Christian was of more value than twenty Turks; and, after these 
bold preludes, they were prudently content to maintain the rampart 
with their missile weapons. Nor should this prudence be accused of 
pusillanimity. The nation was indeed pusillanimous and base; but the 
last Constantine deserves the name of a hero: his noble band of volun- 
teers was inspired with Roman virtue; and the foreign auxiliaries sup- 
ported the honour of the Western chivalry. The incessant volleys of 
lances and arrows were accompanied with the smoke, the sound, and the 
fire of their musketry and cannon. Their small arms discharged at the 
same time either five, or even ten, balls of lead, of the size of a walnut; 
and,, according to the closeness of the ranks and the force of the pow- 
der,, several breastplates and bodies were transpierced by the same shot. 
But the Turkish approaches were soon sunk in trenches or covered 
with ruins. Each day added to the science of the Christians; but their 
inadequate stock of gunpowder was wasted in the operations of each 
day. Their ordnance was not powerful either in size or number; and 
if they possessed some heavy cannon, they feared to plant them on the 
walls, lest the aged structure should be shaken and overthrown by the 
explosion. 89 The same destructive secret had been revealed to the 
Moslems; by whom it was employed with the superior energy of zeal, 
riches, and despotism. The great cannon of Mohammed has been sepa- 
rately noticed; an important and visible object in the history of the 
times: but that enormous engine was flanked by two fellows almost of 
equal magnitude: 40 the long order of the Turkish artillery was pointed 
against the walls.; fourteen batteries thundered at once on the most 
accessible places; and of one of these it is ambiguously expressed that it 
was mounted with one hundred, and thirty guns, or that it discharged 
one hundred and thirty bullets. Yet in the power and activity of the 
sultan we may discern the infancy of the new science. Under a master 
who counted the moments the great cannon could be loaded and fired 
no more than seven times in one day. 41 The heated metal unfortu-

nately burst; several workmen were destroyed, and the skill of an artist 
was admired who bethought himself of preventing the danger and the 
accident, by pouring oil, after each explosion, into the mouth of the 
cannon. 

The first random shots were productive of more sound than effect; 
and it was by the advice of a Christian that the engineers were taught 
to level their aim against the two opposite sides of the salient angles 
of a bastion. However imperfect, the weight and repetition of the fire 
made some impression on the walls; and the Turks, pushing their ap- 
proaches to the edge of the ditch, attempted to fill the enormous chasm 
and to build a road to the assault. 42 Innumerable fascines, and hogs- 
heads, and trunks of trees, were heaped on each other; and such was 
the impetuosity of the throng, that the foremost and the weakest were 
pushed headlong down the precipice and instantly buried under the 
accumulated mass. To fill the ditch was the toil of the besiegers; to 
clear away the rubbish was the safety of the besieged; and, after a long 
and bloody conflict, the web that had been woven in the day was still 
unravelled in the night. The next resource of Mohammed was the 
practice of mines; but the soil was rocky; in every attempt he was 
stopped and undermined by the 'Christian engineers; nor had the art 
been yet invented of replenishing those subterraneous passages with 
gunpowder and blowing whole towers and cities into the air. 48 A cir- 
cumstance that distinguishes the siege of Constantinople is the reunion 
of the ancient and modern artillery. The cannon were intermingled 
with the mechanical engines for casting stones and darts; the bullet 
and the battering-ram were directed against the same walls; nor had 
the discovery of gunpowder superseded the use of the liquid and un- 
extinguishable fire. A wooden turret of the. largest size was advanced 
on rollers: this portable magazine of ammunition and fascines was pro- 
tected by a threefold covering of bulls' hides; incessant volleys were 
securely discharged from the loopholes; in the front three doors were 
contrived for the alternate sally and retreat of the soldiers and work- 
men. They ascended by a staircase to the upper platform, and, as high 
as the tevd of that platform, a scaling-ladder could be raised by pul- 
leys to form a bridge and grapple with the adverse rampart By these 
various arts of annoyance, some as new as they were pernicious to th 
Greeks, the tower of St. Romanus was at length overturned: after *

bloody and obstinate eloquence of the Abbe de Vertot, in his prolix descrip-

had a turn for romance; and as he wrote to please the Order, he has 
adopted the same spirit of enthusiasm and chivalry.

George of Sienna (Tiraboschi, torn. vi. P. i. p. 344).- They were first 
practised at Sarzanella, in 1487; but the honour and improvement in 1503 
is ascribed to Peter of Navarre, who used them with success in the wars of 
Italy (Hist de la Ligue de Cambray, torn. ii. p. 93-97).

severe struggle the Turks were repulsed from the breach and inter- 
rupted by darkness; but they trusted that with the return of light they 
should renew the attack with fresh vigour and decisive success. Of 
this pause of action, this interval of hope, each moment was improved 
by the activity of the emperor and Justiniani, who passed the night on 
the spot, and urged the labours which involved the safety of the church 
and city. At the dawn of day the impatient sultan perceived, with 
astonishment and grief, that his wooden turret had been reduced to 
ashes: the ditch was cleared and restored, and the tower of St. Romanus 
was again strong and entire. He deplored the failure of his design, and 
uttered a profane exclamation, that the word of the thirty-seven thou- 
sand prophets should not have compelled him to believe that such a 
work, in so short a time, could have been accomplished by the infidels. 
The generosity of the Christian princes was cold and tardy; but in 
the first apprehension of a siege Constantine had negotiated, in the 
isles of the Archipelago, the Morea, and Sicily, the most indispensable 
supplies. As early as the beginning of April, five 44 great ships, 
equipped for merchandise and war, would have sailed from the harbour 
of Chios, had not the wind blown obstinately from the north. 45 One 
of these ships bore the Imperial flag; the remaining four belonged to 
the Genoese; and they were laden with wheat and barley, with wine, 
oil, and vegetables, and, above all, with soldiers and mariners, for the 
service of the capital. After a tedious delay a gentle breeze, and on 
the second day a strong gale from the south, carried them through the 
Hellespont and the Propontis; but the city was already invested by 
sea and land, and the Turkish fleet, at the entrance of the Bosphorus, 
was stretched from shore to shore, in the form of a crescent, to inter- 
cept, or at least to repel, these bold auxiliaries. The reader who has 
present to his mind the geographical picture of Constantinople will 
conceive and admire the greatness of the spectacle. The five Christian 
ships continued to advance with joyful shouts, and a full press both of 
sails and oars, against the hostile fleet of three hundred vessels; and 
the rampart, the camp, the coasts of Europe and Asia, were lined with 
innumerable spectators, who anxiously awaited the event of this mo- 
mentous succour. At the first view that event could not appear doubt- 
ful; the superiority of the Moslems was beyond all measure or account, 
and, in a calm, their numbers and valour must inevitably have pre- 
vailed. But their hasty and imperfect navy had been created, not by 
the genius of the people, but by the will of the sultan: in the height 
of their prosperity the Turks have acknowledged that, if God had given 

"It is singular that the Greeks should not agree in the number of these 
illustrious vessels; the five of Ducas, the four of Phranza and Leonardus, 
and the two of Chalcocondyles, must be extended to the smaller, or con- 
fined to larger, size. Voltaire, in giving one of these ships to Frederic III., 
confounds the emperors of the East and West.

them the earth, he had left the sea to the infidels; 46 and a series of 
defeats, a rapid progress of decay, had established the truth of their 
modest confession. Except eighteen galleys of some force, the rest of 
their fleet consisted of open boats, rudely constructed and awkwardly 
managed, crowded with troops, and destitute of cannon;' and since 
courage arises in a great measure from the consciousness of strength, 
the bravest of the Janizaries might tremble on a new element. In the 
Christian squadron five stout and lofty ships were guided by skilful 
pilots, and manned with the veterans of Italy and Greece, long prac- 
tised in the arts and perils of the sea. Their weight was directed to 
sink or scatter the weak obstacles that impeded their passage: their 
artillery swept the waters; their liquid fire was poured on the heads of 
the adversaries, who, with the design of boarding, presumed to ap- 
proach them; and the winds and waves are always on the side of 
the ablest navigators. In this conflict the Imperial vessel, which had 
been almost overpowered, was rescued by the Genoese; but the Turks, 
in a distant and a closer attack, were twice repulsed with considerable 
loss. Mohammed himself sat on horseback on the beach, to encourage 
their valour by his voice and presence, by the promise of reward, and 
by fear more potent than the fear of the enemy. The passions of his 
soul, and even the gestures of his body, 47 seemed to imitate the actions 
of the combatants; and, as if he had been the lord of nature, he spurred 
his horse with a fearless and impotent effort into the sea. His loud 
reproaches, and the clamours of the camp, urged the Ottomans to a 
third attack, more fatal and bloody than the two former; and I must 
repeat, though I cannot credit, the evidence of Phranza, who affirms, 
from their own mouth, that they lost above twelve thousand men in 
the slaughter of the day. They fled in disorder to the shores of Europe 
and Asia, while the Christian squadron, triumphant and unhurt, steered 
along the Bosphorus, and securely anchored within the chain of the 
harbour. In the confidence of victory, they boasted that the whole 
Turkish power must have yielded to their arms; but the admiral, or 
captain bashaw, found some consolation for a painful wound in his 
eye, by representing that accident as the cause of his defeat. Baltha 
Ogli was a renegade of the race of the Bulgarian princes: his military 
character was tainted with the unpopular vice of avarice; and under the 
despotism of the prince or people, misfortune is a sufficient evidence 
of guilt. His rank and services were annihilated by the displeasure of 
Mohammed. In the royal presence, the captain bashaw was extended 
on the ground by four slaves, and received one hundred strokes with 

49 The perpetual decay and weakness of the Turkish navy may be observed 
in Rycaut (State of the Ottoman Empire, p. 372-378), Th^venot (Voyages, 
P. ip 2^242), and Tott (Memoires, torn, iii.) ; the last of whom is 
always solicitous to amuse and amaze his reader. 

I must confess that I have before my eyes the living picture which 
Thucydides (1. vii. c. 71) has drawn of the passions and gestures of the

a golden rod: 48 his death had been pronounced, and he adored the 
clemency of the sultan, who was satisfied with the milder punishment 
of confiscation and exile. The introduction of this supply revived the 
hopes of the Greeks, and accused the supineness of their Western allies. 
Amidst the deserts of Anatolia and the rocks of Palestine, the millions 
of the crusades had buried themselves in a voluntary and inevitable 
grave; but the situation of the Imperial city was strong against her 
enemies, and accessible to her friends; and a rational and moderate 
armament of the maritime states might have saved the relics of the 
Roman name, and maintained a Christian fortress in the heart of the 
Ottoman empire. Yet this was the sole and feeble attempt for the de- 
liverance of Constantinople: the more distant powers were insensible 
of its danger; and the ambassador of Hungary, or at least of Huniades r 
resided in the Turkish camp, to remove the fears and to direct the 
operations of the sultan.* 9 

It was difficult for the Greeks to penetrate the secret of the divan; 
yet the Greeks are persuaded that a resistance so obstinate and surpris- 
ing had fatigued the perseverance of Mohammed. He began to medi- 
tate a retreat; and the siege would have been speedily raised, if the 
ambition and jealousy of the second vizir had not opposed the perfid- 
ious advice of Calil Bashaw, who still maintained a secret correspond- 
ence with the Byzantine court. The reduction of the city appeared 
to be hopeless, unless a double attack could be made from the harbour 
as well as from the, land; but the harbour was inaccessible: an im- 
penetrable chain was now defended by eight large ships, more than 
twenty of a smaller size, with several galleys and sloops; and, instead 
of forcing this barrier, the Turks might apprehend a naval sally and a 
second encounter in the open sea. In this perplexity the genius of Mo- 
hammed conceived and executed a plan of a bold and marvellous cast, 
of transporting by land his lighter vessels and military stores from the 
Bosphprus into the higher part of the harbour. The distance is about 
ten miles; the ground is uneven, and was overspread with thickets; 
and, as the road must be opened behind the suburb of Galata, their 
free passage or total destruction must depend on the option of the 
Genoese. But these selfish merchants were ambitious of the favour of 
being the last devoured, and the deficiency of art was supplied by the 
strength of obedient myriads. A level way was covered with a broad 
platform of strong and solid planks; and to render them more slippery 
and smooth, they were anointed with the fat of sheep and oxen. Four- 



According to the exaggeration or corrupt text of Ducas (c. 38 [p. 270, 
ed. Bonn]) this golden bar was of the enormous and incredible weight of 
500 librae, or pounds. Bouillaud's reading of 500 drachms, or five pounds 
is sufficient to exercise the arm of Mohammed, and bruise the back of his 
admiral. 

* Ducas, who confesses himself ill informed of the affairs of Hungary 
assigns a motive of superstition, a fatal belief that Constantinople would 
be the term of the Turkish conquests. See Phranza (1. iii. c. 20) and

score light galleys and brigantines of fifty and thirty oars were disem- 
barked on the Bosphorus shore, arranged successively on rollers, and 
drawn forwards by the power of men and pulleys. Two guides or 
pilots w^re stationed at the helm and the prow of each vessel: the sails 
were unfurled to the winds, and the labour was cheered by song and 
acclamation. In the course of a single night this Turkish fleet pain- 
fully climbed the hill, steered over the plain, and was launched from 
the declivity into the shallow waters of the harbour, far above the 
molestation of the deeper vessels of the Greeks. The real importance 
of this operation was magnified by the consternation and confidence 
which it inspired; but the notorious, unquestionable fact was displayed 
before the eyes, and is recorded by the pens, of the two nations. 30 A 
similar stratagem had been repeatedly practised by the ancients; 51 the 
Ottoman galleys (I must again repeat) should be considered as large 
boats; and, if we compare the magnitude and the distance, the obstacles 
and the means, the boasted miracle 52 has perhaps been equalled by the 
industry of our own times. oa As soon as Mohammed had occupied the 
upper harbour with a fleet and army, he constructed in the narrowest 
part a bridge, or rather mole, of fifty cubits in breadth and one hundred 
in length: it was formed of casks and hogsheads, joined with rafters, 
linked with iron, and covered with a solid floor. On this floating bat- 
tery he planted one of his largest cannon, while the fourscore galleys, 
with troops and scaling-ladders, approached the most accessible side, 
which had formerly been stormed by the Latin conquerors. The indo- 
lence of the Christians has been accused for not destroying these un- 
finished works; but their fire, by a superior fire, was controlled and 
silenced; nor were they wanting in a nocturnal attempt to burn the ves- 
sels as well as the bridge of the sultan. His viligance prevented their 
approach: their foremost galliots were sunk or taken; forty youths, the 



of ten miles, ana to prolong tne term 01 one mgm. 

w Phranza relates two examples of a similar transportation 1 over the six 
miles of the isthmus of Corinth; the one fabulous, of Augustus after the 
battle of .Actium; the other true, of Nicetas, a Greek general m the tenth 
century. To these he might have added a bold enterprise of Hannibal to 
introduce his vessels into the harbour of Tarentum (Polybius, 1. via. [c. 30]

bravest of Italy and Greece, were inhumanly massacred at his com- 
mand; nor could the emperor's grief be assuaged by the just though 
cruel retaliation of exposing from the walls the heads of two hundred 
and sixty Musulman captives. After a siege of forty days the fate of 
Constantinople could no longer be averted. The diminutive garrison 
was exhausted by a double attack: the fortifications, which had stood 
for ages against hostile violence, were dismantled on all sides by the 
Ottoman cannon; many breaches were opened, and near the gate of 
St. Romanus four towers had been levelled with the ground. For the 
payment of his feeble and mutinous troops, Constantine was compelled 
to despoil the churches with the promise of a fourfold restitution; and 
his sacrilege offered a new reproach to the enemies of the union. A 
spirit of discord impaired the remnant of the Christian strength: the 
Genoese and Venetian auxiliaries asserted the pre-eminence of their 
respective service; and Justiniani and the great duke, whose ambition 
was not extinguished by the common danger, accused each other of 
treachery and cowardice. 

During the siege of Constantinople the words of peace and capitula- 
tion had been sometimes pronounced; and several embassies had passed 
between the camp and the city. 54 The Greek emperor was humbled 
by adversity; and would have yielded to any terms compatible with re- 
ligion and royalty. The Turkish sultan was desirous of sparing the 
blood of his soldiers; still more desirous of securing for his own use 
the Byzantine treasures; and he accomplished a sacred duty in present- 
ing to the Gabours the choice of circumcision, of tribute, or of death. 
The avarice of Mohammed might have been satisfied with an annual 
sum of one hundred thousand ducats; but his ambition grasped the 
capital of the East: to the prince he offered a rich equivalent, to the 
people a free toleration, or a safe departure: but after some fruitless 
treaty, he declared his resolution of finding either a throne or a grave 
under the walls of Constantinople. A sense of honour, and the fear of 
universal reproach, forbade Palaeologus to resign the city into the 
hands of the Ottomans; and he determined to abide the last extremi- 
ties of war. Several days were employed by the sultan in the prepara- 
tions of the assault; and a respite was granted by his favourite science 
of astrology, which had fixed on the twenty-ninth of May as the for- 
tunate and fatal hour. On the evening of the twenty-seventh he issued 
his final orders; assembled in his presence the military chiefs; and dis- 
persed his heralds through the camp to proclaim the duty and the mo- 
tives of the perilous enterprise. Fear is the first principle of a despotic 
government; and his menaces were expressed in the Oriental style, that 
the fugitives and deserters, had they the wings of a bird/ 5 should not

escape from his inexorable justice. The greatest part of his bashaws 
and Janizaries were the offspring of Christian parents: but the glories 
of the Turkish name were perpetuated by successive adoption; and in 
the gradual change of individuals, the spirit of a legion, a regiment, or 
an oda, is kept alive by imitation and discipline. In this holy warfare 
the Moslems were exhorted to purify their minds with prayer, their 
bodies with seven ablutions; and to abstain from food till the dose of 
the ensuing day. A crowd of dervishes visited the tents, to instil the 
desire of martyrdom, and the assurance of spending an immortal youth 
amidst the rivers and gardens of paradise, and in the embraces of the 
black-eyed virgins. Yet Mohammed principally trusted to the efficacy 
of temporal and visible rewards. A double pay was promised to the 
victorious troops; " The city and the buildings," said Mohammed, " are 
mine; but I resign to your valour the captives and the spoil, the treas- 
ures of gold and beauty; be rich and be happy. Many are the provinces 
of my empire: the intrepid soldier who first ascends the walls of Con- 
stantinople shall be rewarded with the government of the fairest and 
most wealthy; and my gratitude shall accumulate his honours and for- 
tunes above the measure of his own hopes." Such various and potejit 
motives diffused among the Turks a general ardour, regardless of life 
and impatient for action: the camp re-echoed with the Moslem shouts 
of " God is God: there fc but one God, and Mohammed is the apostle 
of God; " cc and the sea and land, from Galata to the seven towers, were 
illuminated by the blaze of their nocturnal fires. 

Far different was the state of the Christians; who, with loud and 
impotent complaints, deplored the guilt, or the punishment, of their 
sins. The celestial image of the Virgin had been exposed in solemn 
procession; but their divine patroness was deaf to their entreaties: 
they accused the obstinacy of the emperor for refusing a timely sur- 

more than an Oriental figure: but in the tragedy of Irene Mohammed's 
passion soars above sense and reason: 

Should the fierce North, upon his frozen wings, 
Bear him aloft above the wondering clouds, 
And seat him in the Pleiads' golden chariot- 
Thence should my fury drag him down to tortures. 

Besides the extravagance of the rant, I must observe, i. That the opera- 
tion of the winds must be confined to the lower region of the air. 2. That 
the name, etymology, and fable of the Pleiads are purely Greek (Scholiast 
ad Homer, 2. 686; Eudocia in Ionia, p. 339? Apollodor. 1. iii. c. 10; Heyne, 
p 220- Not. 682), and had no affinity with the astronomy of the East 
(Hyde ad Ulugbeg, Tabul in Syntagma Dissert, torn. i. p. 40, 4?; Goguet, 
Origine des Arts, etc., torn. vi. p. 73-78; Gebelin, Hist, du Calendner, p. 73), 
which Mohammed had studied. 3- The golden chariot does not exist either 
in science or fiction; but I much fear that Dr. Johnson has confounded the 
Pleiads with the great bear or waggon, the zodiac with a northern con- 
stellation:

render; anticipated the horrors of their fate; and sighed for the repose 
and security of Turkish servitude. The noblest of the Greeks, and the 
bravest of the allies, were summoned to the palace, to prepare them, on 
the evening of the twenty-eighth, for the duties and dangers of the 
general assault. The last speech of Palaeologus was the funeral oration 
of the Roman empire: 57 he promised, he conjured, and he vainly at- 
tempted to infuse the hope which was extinguished in his own mind. 
In this world all was comfortless and gloomy; and neither the Gospel 
nor the church have proposed any conspicuous recompense to the heroes 
who fall in the service of their country. But the example of their 
prince, and the confinement of a siege, had armed these warriors with 
the courage of despair; and the pathetic scene is described by the feel- 
ings of the historian Phranza, who was himself present at this mourn- 
ful assembly. They wept, they embraced: regardless of their families 
and fortunes, they devoted their lives; and each commander, departing 
to his station, maintained all night a vigilant and anxious watch on the 
rampart. The emperor, and some faithful companions, entered the 
dome of St. Sophia, which in a few hours was to be converted into a 
mosque- and devoutly received, with tears and prayers, the sacrament 
of the holy communion. He reposed some moments in the palace, 
which resounded with cries and lamentations; solicited the pardon of 
all whom he might have injured j 58 and mounted on horseback to visit 
the guards, and explore the motions of the enemy. The distress and 
fall of the last Constantino are more glorious than the long prosperity 
of the Byzantine Caesars. 

In the confusion of darkness an assailant may sometimes succeed; 
but in this great and general attack, the military judgment and astrolog- 
ical knowledge of Mohammed advised him to expect the morning, 
the memorable twenty-ninth of May, in the fourteen hundred and fifty- 
third year of the Christian era. The preceding night had been strenu- 
ously employed: the troops, the cannon, and the fascines were advanced 
to the edge of the ditch, which in many parts presented a smooth and 
level passage to the breach; and his fourscore galleys almost touched, 
with the prows and their scaling ladders, the less defensible walls of 
the harbour. Under pain of death, silence was enjoined; but the physi- 
cal laws of motion and sound are not obedient to discipline or fear: 
each individual might suppress his voice and measure his footsteps; 
but the march and labour of .thousands must inevitably produce a 
strange confusion of dissonant clamours, which reached the ears of the 

"I am afraid that this discourse was composed by Phranza himself: 
and it smells so grossly of the sermon and the convent, that I almost doubt 
whether it was pronounced by Constantine. Leonardus assigns him another 
speech, ^n which he addresses himself more respectfully to the Latin 
auxiliaries. 

fThis abasement, which devotioii has sometimes extorted from dying 
princes, is an improvement of the Gospel doctrine of the forgiveness of 
injuries^ it is more easy to forgive 4&amp;&gt; times than once to ask pardon of

watchmen of the towers. At daybreak, without the customary signal of 
the morning gun, the Turks assaulted the city by sea and land; and the 
similitude of a twined or twisted thread has been applied to -the dose- 
ness and continuity of their line of attack. 60 The foremost ranks con- 
sisted of the 1 refuse of the host, a voluntary crowd who fought without 
order or command; of the feebleness of age or childhood, of peasants 
and vagrants, and of all who had joined the camp in the blind hope 
of plunder and martyrdom. The common impulse drove them onwards 
to the wall; the most audacious to climb were instantly precipitated; 
and not a dart, not a bullet, of the Christians, was idly wasted on the 
accumulated throng. But their strength and ammunition were ex- 
hausted in this laborious- defence: the ditch was filled with the bodies 
of the slain; they supported the footsteps of their companions; and of 
this devoted vanguard the death was more serviceable than the life. 
Under their respective bashaws and sanjaks, the troops of Anatolia 
and Romania were successively led to the charge: their progress was 
various and doubtful; but, after a conflict of two hours, the Greeks 
still maintained and improved their advantage; and the voice of the 
emperor was heard, encouraging his soldiers to achieve, by a last effort, 
the deliverance of their country. In that fatal moment the Janizaries 
arose, fresh, vigorous, and invincible. The sultan himself on horseback, 
with an iron mace in his hand, was the spectator and judge of their 
valour; he was surrounded by ten thousand of his 'domestic troops, 
whom he reserved for the decisive occasion; and the tide of battle was 
directed and impelled by his voice and eye. His numerous ministers 
of justice were posted behind the line, to urge, to restrain, and to pun- 
ish; and if danger was in the- front, .shame and inevitable death were 
in the rear, of the fugitives. The cries of fear and of pain were drowned 
in the martial music of drums, trumpets, and attabaUs; and experience 
has proved that the mechanical operation of sounds, by quickening .the 
circulation of the blood and spirits, will act on the .human machine 
more forcibly than :the .eloquence of reason -and honour. From the 
lines, the galleys, and the bridge, the Ottoman artillery thundered QJJ 
all sides; and the camp and city, the Greeks and the Turks, were in- 
volved in a cloud of smoke, which could only be dispelled by the .final 
deliverance or destruction of the Roman empire. The single combats 
of the heroes of history or fable amuse our fancy and engage our affec- 
tions: the skilful evolutions of war may .inform .the mind, and improve 
a necessary, though pernicious, science. -But in the uniform and odi- 
ous pictures of a general assault, all is blood, and horror, and confu- 
sion; nor shall I strive, -at the distance of &lt;three centuries and a thou- 
sand miles, to delineate a scene of which there could be np spectators, 
and of which the actors themselves were incapable of forming any just 
or adequate idea.

772 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

The immediate loss of Constantinople may be ascribed to the bullet, 
or arrow, which pierced the gauntlet of John Justiniani. The sight of 
tiis blood, and the exquisite pain, appalled the courage of the chief, 
whose arms and counsels were the firmest rampart of the city. As he 
withdrew from his station in quest of a surgeon, his flight was perceived 
and stopped by the indefatigable emperor. " Your wound," exclaimed 
Palaeologus, " is slight; the danger is pressing: your presence is neces- 
sary; and whither will you retire? " " I will retire," said the trembling 
Genoese, "by the same road which God has opened to the Turks;" 
and at these words he hastily passed through one of the breaches of 
the inner wall. By this pusillanimous act he stained the honours of a 
military life; and the few days which he survived in Galata, or the isle 
of Chios, were embittered by his own and the public reproach. 00 His 
example was imitated by the greatest part of the Latin auxiliaries, and 
the defence began to slacken when the attack was pressed with re- 
doubled vigour. The number of the Ottomans was fifty, perhaps a 
hundred, times superior to that of the Christians; the double walls were 
reduced by the cannon to a heap of ruins: in a circuit of several miles 
some places must be found more easy of access, or more feebly guarded; 
and if the besiegers could penetrate in a single point, the whole city was 
irrecoverably lost. The first who deserved the sultan's reward was Has- 
san the Janizary, of gigantic stature and strength. With his scimitar 
in one hand and his buckler in the other, he ascended the outward for- 
tification: of the thirty Janizaries who were emulous of his valour, 
eighteen perished in the bold adventure. Hassan and his twelve com- 
panions had reached the summit: the giant was precipitated from the 
rampart: he rose on one knee, and was again oppressed by a shower of 
darts and stones. But his success had proved that the achievement was 
possible: the walls and towers were instantly covered with a swarm of 
Turks; and the Greeks, now driven from the vantage ground, were 
overwhelmed by increasing multitudes. Amidst these multitudes, the 
emperor, 81 who accomplished all the duties of a general and a soldier, 

80 In the severe censure of the flight of Justiniani, Phranza expresses his 
own feelings and those of the public. For some private reasons he is 
treated with more lenity and respect by Ducas; but the words of Leonardus 
Chiensis express his strong and recent indignation, gloriae salutis suique 
oblitus. In the whole series of their Eastern policy, his countrymen, the 
Genoese, were always suspected, and often guilty. 

[This condemnation of John Guistiniani is wholly undeserved. The fact 
that^ the great engineer only lived six days after the wound had been 
received showed that the injury was not slight. The unfortunate man 
suffers because of the untrustworthy character of his countrymen. They 
were proverbially treacherous. But Guistiniani's services and valour have 
been extolled by all the Greek writers, and this is sufficient answer to the

was long seen and finally lost. The nobles, who fought round his per- 
son, sustained, till their last breath, the honourable names of Palaolo- 
gus and Cantacuzene: his mournful exclamation was heard, "Cannot 
there be found a Christian to cut off my head? " 2 and his last fear 
was that of falling alive into the hands of the infidels. 08 The prudent 
despair of Constantine cast away the purple: amidst the tumult he fell 
by an unknown hand, and his body was buried under a mountain of 
the slain. After his death resistance and order were no more: the 
Greeks fled towards the city; and many were pressed and stifled in the 
narrow pass of the gate of St. Romanus. The victorious Turks rushed 
through the breaches of the inner wall; and as they advanced into the 
streets, they were soon joined by their brethren, who had forced the 
gate Phenar on the side of the harbour. 64 In the first heat of the pur- 
suit about two thousand Christians were put to the sword; but avarice 
soon prevailed over cruelty; and the victors acknowledged that they 
should immediately have given quarter, if the valour of the emperor 
and his chosen bands had not prepared them for a similar opposition 
in every part of the capital. It was thus, after a siege of fifty-three 
days, that Constantinople, which had defied the power of Chosroes, the 
Chagan, and the caliphs, was irretrievably subdued by the arms of 
Mohammed the Second. Her empire only had been subverted by the 
Latins: her religion was trampled in the dust by the Moslem con- 
querors. 05 

The tidings of misfortune fly with a rapid wing; yet such was the 
extent of Constantinople, that the more distant quarters might pro- 
long, some moments, the happy ignorance of their ruin. 60 But in the 

image of his death; but we may, without flattery, apply these noble lines 
of Dryden: 

As to Sebastian, let them search the field; 
And, where they find a mountain of the slain, 
Send one to climb, and, looking down beneath, 
There they will find him at his manly length, 
With his face up to heaven, in that red monument 
Which his good sword had digged. 

"Spondanus (A.D. 1453, No. 10), who has hopes of his salvation, wishes 
to absolve this demand from the guilt of suicide. 

**Leonardus Chiensis very properly observes that the Turks, had they 
'known the emperor, would have laboured to save and secure a captive so 
.acceptable to the sultan. 

^Cantemir, p. 96. The Christian ships in the mouth of the harbour had 
flanked and retarded this naval attack. 

* Chalcocondyles most absurdly supposes that Constantinople was sacked 
'by the Asiatics in revenge for the ancient calamities of Troy [1. viii. 
p. 403, ed. Bonn] ; and the grammarians of the fifteenth century are happy 
-to melt down the uncouth appellation of Turks into the more classical 
name of Teucri.

general consternation, in the feelings of selfish or social anxiety, in the 
tumult and thunder of the assault, a sleepless night and morning must 
have elapsed; nor can I believe that many Grecian ladies were awak- 
ened by the Janizaries from a sound and tranquil slumber. On the 
assurance of the public calamity, the houses and convents were in- 
stantly deserted; and the trembling inhabitants flocked together in the 
streets, like a herd of timid animals, as if accumulated weakness could 
be productive of strength, or in the vain hope that amid the crowd each 
individual might be safe and invisible. From every part of the capital 
they flowed into the church of St. Sophia: in the space of an hour, the 
sanctuary, the choir, the nave, the upper and lower galleries, were 
filled with the multitudes of fathers and husbands, of women and chil- 
dren, of priests, monks, and religious virgins: the doors were barred 
on the inside, and they sought protection from the sacred dome which 
they had so lately abhorred as a profane and polluted edifice. Their 
confidence was founded on the prophecy of an enthusiast or impostor, 
that one day the Turks would enter Constantinople, and pursue the 
Romans as far as the column of Constantine in the square before St. 
Sophia: but that this would be the term of their calamities; that an 
angel would descend from heaven with a sword in his hand, and would 
deliver the empire, with that celestial weapon, to a poor man seated at 
the foot of the column. "Take this sword," would he say, "and 
avenge the people of the Lord." At these animating words the Turks 
would instantly fly, and the victorious Romans would drive them from 
the West, and from all Anatolia, as far as the frontiers of Persia. It 
is on this occasion that Ducas, with some fancy and much truth, up- 
braids the discord and obstinacy of the Greeks. " Had that angel ap- 
peared," exclaims the historian, " had he offered to exterminate your 
foes if you would consent to the union of the church, even then, in that 
fatal moment, you would have rejected your safety, or have deceived 
your God." 07 

While they expected the descent of the tardy angel, the doors were 
broken with axes; and as the Turks encountered no resistance, their 
bloodless hands were employed in selecting and securing the multitude 
of their prisoners. Youth, beauty, and the appearance of wealth, at- 
tracted their choice; and the right of property was decided among 
themselves, by a prior seizure, by personal strength, and by the author- 
ity of command. In the space of an hour the male captives were bound 
with cords, the females with their veils and girdles. The senators were 
linked with their slaves; the prelates with the porters of the church; 
and young men of a plebeian class with noble maids whose faces had 
been invisible to the sun and their nearest kindred. In this common 

"This lively description is extracted from Ducas (c. 39 [p. 291, ed. Bonn]), 
who, two years afterwards, was sent ambassador from the prince of Lesbos 
to the sultan (c. 44). Till Lesbos was subdued in 1463 (Phranza, 1. iii. c. 27), 
that island must have been full of the fugitives of Constantinople, 
delighted to repeat, perhaps to adorn, the tale of their misery. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 775 

captivity the ranks of society were confounded; the ties of nature were 
cut asunder; and the inexorable soldier was careless of the father's 
groans, the tears of the mother, and the lamentations of the children. 
The loudest in their wailings were the nuns, who were torn from the 
altar with naked bosoms, outstretched hands, and dishevelled hair; 
and we should piously believe that few could be tempted to prefer the 
vigils of the harem to those of the monastery. Of these unfortunate 
Greeks, of these domestic animals, whole strings were rudely driven 
through the streets; and as the conquerors were eager to return for 
more prey, their trembling pa,ce was quickened with menaces and 
blows. At the same hour a similar rapine was exercised in all the 
churches and monasteries, in all the palaces and habitations, of the 
capital; nor could any place, however sacred or sequestered, protect the 
persons or the property of the Greeks. Above sixty thousand of this 
devoted people were transported from the city to the camp and fleet; 
exchanged or sold according to the caprice or interest of their masters, 
and dispersed in remote servitude through the provinces of ihe Ottoman 
empire. Among these we may notice some remarkable characters. The 
historian Phranza, first chamberlain and principal secretary, was in- 
volved with his family in the common lot. After suffering four months 
the hardships of slavery, he recovered his freedom: in the ensuing win- 
ter he ventured to Adrianople, and ransomed his wife from the mir 
bashi, or master of the horse; but his two children, in the flower of 
youth and beauty, had been seized for the use of Mohammed himself. 
The daughter of Phranza died in the seraglio, perhaps a virgin: his son, 
in the fifteenth year of his age, preferred death to infamy, and was 
stabbed by the hand of the royal lover. 08 A deed thus inhuman can- 
not surely be expiated by the taste and liberality with which he re- 
leased a Grecian matron and her two daughters, on receiving a Latin 
ode from Philelphus, who had chosen a wife in that noble family. 09 
The pride or cruelty of Mohammed would have been most sensibly 
gratified by the capture of a Roman legate; but the dexterity of Car- 
dinal Isidore eluded the search, and he escaped from Galata in a ple- 
beian habit. 70 The chain and entrance of the outward harbour was still 
occupied by the Italian ships of merchandise and war. They had sig- 

08 See Phranza, L, iii. c. 20, 21. His expressions are positive: Ameras 
sua manu jugulavit . . . volebat enim eo turpiter et nefarie abuti. Me 
miserum et infelicem! Yet he could only learn from report the bloody 
or impure scenes that were acted in the dark recesses of the seraglio. 

*See Tiraboschi (torn. vi. P. i. p. 290) and Lancelot (Mem. de 1' Academic 
des Inscriptions, torn. x. p. 718). I should be curious to learn how he 
could &gt; praise the public enemy, whom he so often reviles as the most corrupt 
and inhuman of tyrants. 

"The Commentaries of Pius II. suppose that he craftily placed his 
cardinal's hat on the head of a corpse which was cut off and exposed in 
triumph, while the legate himself was bought and delivered as a captive of 
no value. The great Belgic Chronicle adorns his escape with new adven- 
tures, which he suppressed (says Spondanus, A.D. 1453, No. 15) in his own 
letters, lest he should lose the merit and reward of suffering for Christ 



776 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

nalised their valour in the siege: they embraced the moment of retreat, 
while the Turkish mariners were dissipated in the pillage of the city. 
When they hoisted sail, the beach was covered with a suppliant and 
lamentable crowd; but the means of transportation were scanty; the 
Venetians and Genoese selected their countrymen; and, notwithstand- 
ing the fairest promises of the sultan, the inhabitants of Galata evacu- 
ated their houses, and embarked with their most precious effects. 

In the fall and the sack of great cities an historian is condemned to 
repeat the tale of uniform calamity: the same effects must be produced 
by the same passions; and when those passions may be indulged with- 
out control, small, alas! is the difference between civilised and savage 
man. Amidst the vague exclamations of bigotry and hatred, the Turks 
are not accused of a wanton or immoderate effusion of Christian blood: 
but according to their maxims (the maxims of antiquity), the lives of 
the vanquished were forfeited; and the legitimate reward of the con- 
queror was derived from the service, the sale, or the ransom of his cap- 
tives of both sexes. 71 The wealth of Constantinople had been granted 
by the sultan to his victorious troops; and the rapine of an hour is 
more productive than the industry of years. But as no regular division 
was attempted of the spoil, the respective shares were not determined 
by merit; and the rewards of valour were stolen away by the followers 
of the camp, who had declined the toil and danger of the battle. The 
narrative of their depredations could not afford either amusement or 
instruction: the total amount, in the last poverty of the empire, has 
been valued at four millions of ducats; 72 and of this sum a small part 
was the property of the Venetians, the Genoese, the Florentines, and 
the merchants of Ancona. Of these foreigners the stock was improved 
in quick and perpetual circulation: but the riches of the Greeks were 
displayed in the idle ostentation of palaces and wardrobes, or deeply 
buried in treasures of ingots and old coin, lest it should be demanded 
at their hands for the defence of their country. The profanation and 
plunder of the monasteries and churches excited the most tragic com- 
plaints. The dome of St. Sophia itself, the earthly heaven, the second 
firmament, the vehicle of the cherubim, the throne of the glory of 
God, 73 was despoiled of the oblations of ages; and the gold and silver, 
the pearls and jewels, the vases and sacerdotal ornaments, were most 
wickedly converted to the service of mankind. After the divine images 
had been stripped of all that could be valuable to a profane eye, the 
canvas, or the wood, was torn, or broken, or burnt, or trod under foot, 

n Busbequius expatiates with pleasure and applause on the rights of war 
and the use of slavery among the ancients and the Turks (de Legat. 
Turcica, Epist. iii. p. 161). 

"This sum is specified in a marginal note of Leunclavius (Chalcocon- 
dyles, 1. viii. p. 211) ; but, in the distribution to Venice, Genoa, Florence, 
and Ancona, of 50, 20, 20, and 15,000 ducats, I suspect that a figure has 
been dropped. Even with the restitution, the foreign property would scarcely 
exceed one-fourth. 

78 See the enthusiastic praises and lamentations of Phranza (1. iii. c. 17). 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 777 

or applied, in the stables or the kitchen, to the vilest uses. The ex- 
ample of sacrilege was imitated, however, from the Latin conquerors 
of Constantinople; and the treatment which Christ, the Virgin, and the 
saints had sustained from the guilty Catholic, might be inflicted by 
the zealous Musulman on the monuments of idolatry. Perhaps, in- 
stead of joining the public clamour, a philosopher will observe that in 
the decline of the arts the workmanship could not be more valuable 
than the work, and that a fresh supply of visions and miracles would 
speedily be renewed by the craft of the priest and the credulity of the 
people. He will more seriously deplore the loss of the Byzantine li- 
braries, which were destroyed or scattered in the general confusion: 
one hundred and twenty thousand manuscripts are said to have dis- 
appeared; 7 * ten volumes might be purchased for a single ducat; and the 
.same ignominious price, too high perhaps for a shelf of theology, in- 
cluded the whole works of Aristotle and Homer, the noblest produc- 
tions of the science and literature of ancient Greece. We may reflect 
with pleasure that an inestimable portion of our classic treasures was 
safely deposited in Italy; and that the mechanics of a German town 
had invented an art which derides the havoc of time and barbarism. 

From the first hour 75 of the memorable twenty-ninth of May, dis- 
order and rapine prevailed in Constantinople till the eighth hour of the 
same day, when the sultan himself passed in triumph through the gate 
of St. Romanus. He was attended by his vizirs, bashaws, and guards, 
each of whom (says a Byzantine historian) was robust as Hercules, 
dexterous as Apollo, and equal in battle to any ten of the race of ordi- 
nary mortals. The conqueror TG gazed with satisfaction and wonder 
on the strange though splendid appearance of the domes and palaces, 
so dissimilar from the style of Oriental architecture. In the hippo- 
drome, or atmeidan, his eye was attracted by the twisted column of the 
three serpents; and, as a trial of his strength, he shattered with his iron 
mace or battle-axe the under jaw of one of these monsters, 77 which in 
the eyes of the Turks were the idols or talismans of the city. At the 
principal door of St. Sophia he alighted from his horse and entered the - 
dome; and such was his jealous regard for that monument of his glory, 
that, on observing a zealous Musulman in the act of breaking the mar- 
ble pavement, he admonished him with his scimitar that, if the spoil 
and captives were granted to the soldiers, the public and private build- 
ings had been reserved, for the prince. By his command the metropolis 
of the Eastern church was transformed into a mosque: the rich and

portable instruments of superstition had been removed; the crosses 
were thrown down; and the walls, which were covered with images and 
mosaics, were washed and purified, and restored to a state of naked 
simplicity* On the same day, or on the ensuing Friday, the muezin, or 
crier, ascended the most lofty turret, and proclaimed the ezan, or pub- 
lic invitation, in the name of God and his prophet; the imam preached; 
and Mohammed the Second performed the namaz of prayer and thanks- 
giving on the great altar, where the Christian mysteries had so lately 
been celebrated before the last of the Caesars. 78 From St. Sophia he 
proceeded to the august but desolate mansion of a hundred successors 
of the great Constantine, but which in a few hours had been stripped 
of the pomp of royalty. A melancholy reflection on the vicissitudes of 
-human greatness forced itself on his mind, and he repeated an elegant 
distich of Persian poetry: " The spider has wove his web in the Im- 
perial palace, and the owl hath sung her watch-song on the towers of 
Afrasiab." 70 

Yet his mind was not satisfied, nor did the victory seem complete, till 
he was informed of the fate of Constantine whether he had escaped, 
or been made prisoner, or had fallen in the battle. Two Janizaries 
claimed the honour and reward of his death: the body, under a heap of 
slain, was discovered by the golden eagles embroidered on his shoes; 
the Greeks acknowledged with tears the head of their late emperor; 
and, after exposing the bloody trophy, 50 Mohammed bestowed on his 
rival the honours of a decent funeral. After his decease Lucas No- 
taras, great duke 81 and first minister of the empire, was the most im- 
portant prisoner. When he offered his person and his treasures at the 
foot of the throne, " And why," said the indignant sultan, " did you 
not employ these treasures in the defence of your prince and coun- 
try? " "They were yours," answered the slave; " God had reserved 
them for your hands." "If he reserved them for me," replied the 
despot, " how have you presumed to withhold them so long by a fruit- 
less and fatal resistance? " The great duke alleged the obstinacy of 
the strangers, and some secret encouragement from, the Turkish vizir.; 

"We are obliged to Cantemir (p. 102) for the Turkish account of the 
conversion of St. Sophia, so bitterly deplored by Phranza and Ducas. It 
is amusing enough to observe in what opposite lights the same object 
appears to &amp; Musulman and, a Christian eye, , 

19 This distich, which Cantemir gives in the original, derives new beauties 
from the application. It -was thus that' Scipio repeated, in the sack of 
Carthage, the famous prophecy of Homer. The same generous feeling 
carried the mind of the conqueror to the past or the future. 

M I cannot believe with Ducas (see Spondanus, A.D. 1453, No. 13) that 
Mohammed sent round Persia, Arabia, etc., the head of the Greelc emperor: 
he would surely content : himself with a trophy less inhuman. 
* Phranza was the personal enemy of the great duke; nor could time, or 
death, or his own retreat to a monastery, extort a feeKng of .sympathy or 
forgiveness. Ducas is inclined 'to praise and pity the martyr; Chalcocon- 
dyles^is neuter, but we are indebted to him for the hint of the Greek 
conspiracy. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 779 

and from this perilous interview he was at length dismissed with ths 
assurance of pardon and protection. Mohammed condescended to visit 
his wife, a venerable princess oppressed with sickness and grief; and 
his consolation for her misfortunes was in the most tender strain of 
humanity and filial reverence. A similar clemency was extended to the 
principal officers of state, of whom several were ransomed at his ex- 
pense; and during some days he declared, himself the friend and father 
of the vanquished people. But the scene was soon changed, and before 
his departure the hippodrome streamed with the blood of his noblest 
captives. His perfidious cruelty is execrated by the Christians: they 
adorn with the colours of heroic martyrdom the execution of the great 
duke and his two sons, and his death is ascribed to the generous re- 
fusal of delivering his children to the tyrant's lust. Yet a Byzantine 
historian has dropped an unguarded word of conspiracy, deliverance, 
and Italian succour: such treason may be glorious; but the, rebel who 
bravely ventures, has justly forfeited his life; nor should we. blame a 
conqueror for destroying the enemies whom he can no longer trust. 
On the eighteenth of June, the victorious sultan returned to : Adrianople, 
and smiled at the base and hollow embassies of the Christian princes, 
who viewed their approaching rujn in the fall. of the Eastern empire 
Constantinople had been left naked and desoiate, without a prince or 
a people* But she could not he despoiled .of the incomparable situation 
which marks her for the .metropolis, of a great empire; and the genius 
of the place will ever triumph over the accident^. of time and fortune, 
Boursa and Adrianople, the ancient .seats of the Ottomans, sunk into 
provincial towns; and Mohammed the Second ?tablished his own resk 
dence and that of bis successors on the same commanding spot which 
had been chosen by Constantine. 8 ? The fortifications, of Galata,, which 
might afford a shelter to the Latins, were prudently destroyed;, but the 
damage of the Turkish cannon was soon repaired, and befor the: month 
of August great quantities of lime had been, .burnt for the restoration 
of the walls of the capital. As. the entire property of the soil and buildr 
ings, whether public or private, or. profane or sacred; was now trans- 
ferred, to the conqueror, he first , separated, a space of eight furlongs 
from the point of the triangle for the establishment oi his seraglio or 
palace. It is here, in the bosom of luxury, that the Grand Signer (as 
he has been emphatically named by the Italians) appears to reign over 
Europe and Asia; but his person on the shores of the Bosphorus may 
not always be secure from the insults of a hostile navy. In the new 
character of a mosque, the .cathedral of St. Sophia was endowed with an 
ample revenue, crowned .with lofty minarets, and surrounded with

groves and fountains for the devotion and refreshment of the Moslems. 
The same model was imitated in the jami, or royal mosques; and the 
first of these was built by Mohammed himself, on the ruins of the 
church of the holy apostles and the tombs of the Greek emperors. On 
the third day after the conquest the grave of Abou Ayub, or Job, who 
had fallen in the first siege of the Arabs, was revealed in a vision; and 
it is before the sepulchre of the martyr that the new sultans are girded 
with the sword of empire. 88 Constantinople no longer appertains to the 
Roman historian; nor shall I enumerate the civil and religious edifices 
that were profaned or erected by its Turkish masters: the population 
was speedily renewed, and before the end of September five thousand 
families of Anatolia and Romania had obeyed the royal mandate, which 
enjoined them, under pain of death, to occupy their new habitations 
in the capital. The throne of Mohammed was guarded by the num- 
bers and fidelity of his Moslem subjects; but his rational policy as- 
pired to collect the remnant of the Greeks, and they returned in crowds 
as soon as they were assured of their lives, their liberties, and the free 
exercise of their religion. In the election and investiture of a patriarch 
the ceremonial of the Byzantine court was revived and imitated. With 
a mixture of satisfaction and horror, they beheld the sultan on his 
throne, who delivered into the hands of Gennadius the crosier or pas- 
toral staff, the symbol of his ecclesiastical office; who conducted the 
patriarch to the gate of the seraglio, presented him with a horse richly 
caparisoned, and directed the vizirs and bashaws to lead him to the 
palace which had been allotted for his residence. 8 * The churches of 
Constantinople were shared between the two religions: their limits were 
marked; and, till it was infringed by Selim, the grandson of Mo- 
hammed, the Greeks 8C enjoyed above sixty years the benefit of this 
equal partition. Encouraged by the ministers of the divan, who wished 
to elude the fanaticism of the sultan, the Christian advocates presumed 
to allege that this division had been an act, not of generosity, but of 
justice; not a concession, but a compact; and that, if one-half of the 
city had been taken by storm, the other moiety had surrendered on the 
faith of a sacred capitulation. The original grant had indeed been

adorned in the Greek reports to each other, and to the Latins. The fact 
is confirmed by Emanuel Malaxus, who wrote, in vulgar Greek, the History 
of the Patriarchs after the taking of Constantinople, inserted in the Turco- 
Graecia of Crusius (L v. p. 106-184). But the most patient reader will not 
believe that Mohammed adopted the Catholic form, "Sancta Trinitas qua

consumed by fire; but the loss was supplied by the testimony of three 
aged Janizaries who remembered the transaction, and their venal oaths 
are of more weight in the opinion of Cantemir than the positive t and 
unanimous consent of the history of the times. 80 

The remaining fragments of the Greek kingdom in Europe and Asia 
I shall abandon to the Turkish arms; but the final extinction of the 
two last dynasties 87 which have reigned in Constantinople should ter- 
minate the decline and fall of the Roman empire in the East. The 
despots of the Morea, Demetrius and Thomas, 88 the two surviving 
brothers of the name of PAI^EOLOGUS, were astonished by the death of 
the emperor Constantine and the ruin of the monarchy. Hopeless of 
defence, they prepared, with the noble Greeks who adhered to their 
fortune, to seek a refuge in Italy, beyond the reach of the Ottoman 
thunder. Their first apprehensions were dispelled by the victorious sul- 
tan, who contented himself with a tribute of twelve thousand ducats; 
and while his ambition explored the continent and the islands in search 
of prey, he indulged the Morea in a respite of seven years. But this 
respite was a period of grief, discord, and misery. The hexamttion, the 
rampart of the isthmus, so often raised and so often subverted, could 
not long be defended by three hundred Italian archers: the keys of 
Corinth were seized by the Turks; they returned from their summer ex- 
cursions with a train of captives and spoil, and the complaints of the 
injured Greeks were heard with indifference and disdain. The Alba- 
nians, a vagrant tribe of shepherds and robbers, filled the peninsula 
with rapine and murder: the two despots implored the dangerous arid 
humiliating aid of a neighbouring bashaw; and when he had quelled 
the revolt, his lessons inculcated the rule of their future conduct. 
Neither the ties of blood, nor the oaths which they repeatedly pledged 
in the communion and before the altar, nor the stronger pressure of ne- 
cessity, could reconcile or suspend their domestic quarrels. They rav- 
aged each other's patrimony with fire and sword; the alms and succours 
of the West were consumed in civil hostility, and their power was only 

w Cantemir (p. 101-105) insists on the unanimous consent of the Turkish 
historians, ancient as well as modern, and argues that they would not 
have violated the truth to diminish their national glory, since it is esteemed 
more honourable to take a city by force than by composition. But, I. I 
doubt this consent, since he quotes no particular historian; and the Turkish 
Annals of Leunclavius affirm, without exception, that Mohammed took Con- 
stantinople per vim (p. 329). 2. The same argument may be turned in 
favour of the Greeks of the times, who would not have forgotten this 
honourable and salutary treaty. Voltaire, as usual, prefers the Turks to 
the Christians.

Ducas (c. 44, 45) is too brief, and Chalcocondyles (1. vui. ix. x.) too diffuse 
and digressive.

exerted in savage and arbitrary executions. The distress and revenge 
of the weaker rival invoked their supreme lord; and, in the season of 
maturity and revenge, Mohammed declared himself the friend of De- 
metrius, and inarched into the Morea with an irresistible force. When 
he had taken possession of Sparta, " You are too weak," said the sul- 
tan, " to control this turbulent province; I will take your daughter to 
my bed, and you shall pass the remainder of your life in security and 
honour." Demetrius sighed and obeyed; surrendered his daughter and 
his castles, followed to Adrianople his sovereign and son, and received 
for his own maintenance and that of his followers a city in Thrace, and 
the adjacent isles of Imbros, Lemnos, and Samothrace. He was joined 
the next year by a companion of misfortune, the last of the COMNE- 
NIAN race, who, after the taking of Constantinople by the Latins, had 
founded a new empire on the coast of the Black Sea. 80 In the progress 
of his Anatolian conquests, Mohammed invested with a fleet and army 
the capital of David, who presumed to style himself emperor of Trebi- 
zond; 90 and the negotiation was comprised in a short and peremptory 
question. " Will you secure your life and treasures by resigning your 
kingdom? or had you rather forfeit your kingdom, your treasures, and 
your life? " The feeble Comnenus was subdued by his own fears, and 
the example of a Musulmpn neighbour, the prince of Sinope, 01 who, on 
a similar summons, had yielded a fortified city with four hundred can- 
non and ten or twelve thousand soldiers. The capitulation of Trebi- 
zond was faithfully performed, and the emperor, with his family, was 
transported to a castle in Romania; but on a slight suspicion of corre- 
sponding with the Persian king, David, and the whole Comnenian race, 
were sacrificed to the jealousy or avarice of the conqueror. Nor could 
the name of father long protect the unfortunate Demetrius from exile 
and confiscation: his abject submission moved the pity and contempt 
of the sultan; his followers were transplanted to Constantinople, and 
his poverty was alleviated by a pension of fifty thousand aspers, till a 
monastic habit and a tardy death released Palseologus from an earthly 
master. It is not easy to pronounce whether the servitude of Deme-

w Though Tournefort (torn. iii. lettre xvii. p. 179) speaks of Trebizond 
as mal peuplee, Peyssonel, the latest and most accurate observer, can find 
100,000 inhabitants (Commerce de la Mer Noire, torn. ii. p. 72; arid, for 
the province, p. 53-90). Its prosperity and trade are perpetually Disturbed 
by the factious quarrels of two odas of Janizaries, in one of which 30,000 
Lazi are commonly enrolled (Memoires de Tott, torn. iii. p. 16, 17). 

^Ismael Beg, prince of Sinope or Sinople, was possessed (chiefly from 
his copper-manes) of a revenue of 200,000 ducats (Chalcocond. 1. ix. p. 258, 
259 [p. 489, ed. Bonn]). Peyssonel (Commerce de la Mer Noire, torn. ii. p, 
100) ascribes to the modern city 60,000 inhabitants. This account seems 
enormous; yet it is by trading with a people that we become acquainted 
with their wealth and numbers.

trius, or the exile of his brother Thomas, 93 be the most inglorious. On 
the conquest of the Morea the despot escaped to Corfu, and from 
thence to Italy, with some naked adherents: his name, his sufferings, 
and the head of the apostle St. Andrew, entitled him to the hospitality 
of the Vatican; and his misery was prolonged by a pension of six thou- 
sand ducats from the pope and cardinals. His two sons, Andrew and 
Manuel, were educated in Italy; but the eldest, contemptible to his 
enemies and burdensome to his friends, was degraded by the baseness 
of his life and marriage. A title was his sole inheritance; and that in- 
heritance he successively sold to the kings of France and Arragon. 03 
During his transient prosperity, Charles the Eighth was ambitious of 
joining the empire of the East with the kingdom of Naples: in a public 
festival he assumed the appellation and the purple of Augustus; the 
Greeks rejoiced, and the Ottoman already trembled, at the approach of 
the French chivalry. 8 * Manuel Palseologus, the second son, was 
tempted to revisit his native country: his return might be grateful, and 
icould not be dangerous, to the Porte; he was maintained at Constanti- 
nople in safety and ease, and an honourable train of Christians and 
Moslems attended him to the grave. If there be some animals of so 
generous a nature that they refuse to propagate in a domestic state, 
the last of the Imperial race must be ascribed to an inferior kind; he 
accepted from the sultan's liberality two beautiful females, and his 
surviving son was lost in the habit and religion of a Turkish slave. 

The importance of Constantinople was felt and magnified in its loss: 
the pontificate of Nicholas the Fifth, however peaceful and prosperous, 
was dishonoured by the fall of the Eastern empire; and the grief and 
terror of the Latins revived, or seemed to revive, the old enthusiasm 
of the crusades. In one of the most distant countries of the West, 
Philip duke of Burgundy entertained, at Lisle in Flanders, an assembly 
of his nobles; and the pompous pageants of the feast were skilfully 
adapted to their fancy and feelings, 05 In the midst of the banquet a 
gigantic Saracen entered the hall, leading a fictitious elephant with a

ligion, was seen to issue from the castle: she deplored her oppression, 
and accused the slowness of her champions: the principal herald of the 
golden fleece advanced, bearing on his fist a live pheasant, which, ac- 
cording to the rites of chivalry, he presented to the duke. At this ex- 
traordinary summons, Philip, a wise and aged prince, engaged his per- 
son and powers in the holy war against the Turks: his example was 
imitated by the barons and knights of the assembly: they swore to God, 
the Virgin, the ladies, and the pheasant; and their particular vows were 
not less extravagant than the general sanction of their oath. But the 
performance was made to depend on some future and foreign contin- 
gency; and during twelve years, till the last hour of his life, the duke 
of Burgundy might be scrupulously, and perhaps sincerely, on the eve 
of his departure. Had every breast glowed with the same ardour; had 
the union of the Christians corresponded with their bravery; had every 
country from Sweden 9C to Naples supplied a just proportion of cavalry 
and infantry, of men and money, it is indeed probable that Constanti- 
nople would have been delivered, and that the Turks might have been 
chased beyond the Hellespont or the Euphrates. But the secretary of 
the emperor, who composed every epistle, and attended every meeting, 
-^Bneas Sylvius, 07 a statesman and orator, describes from his own ex- 
perience the repugnant state and spirit of Christendom. " It is a body," 
says he, " without a head; a republic without laws or magistrates. The 
pope and the emperor may shine as lofty titles, as splendid images; but 
they are unable to command, and none are willing to obey: every state 
has a separate prince, and every prince has a separate interest. What 
eloquence could unite so many discordant and hostile powers under the 
same standard? Could they be assembled in arms, who would dare 
to assume the office of general? What order could be maintained? 
what military discipline? Who would undertake to feed such an enor- 
mous multitude? Who would understand their various languages, or 
direct their stranger and incompatible manners? What mortal could 
reconcile the English with the French, Genoa with Arragon, the Ger- 
mans with the natives of Hungary and Bohemia? If a small number 
enlisted in the holy war, they must be overthrown by the infidels: if 
many, by their own weight and confusion." Yet the same ^Eneas, when 
he was raised to the papal throne, under the name of Pius the Second, 
devoted his life to the prosecution of the Turkish war. In the council 
of Mantua he excited some sparks of a false or feeble enthusiasm; 
but when the pontiff appeared at Ancona, to embark in person with the 
troops, engagements vanished in excuses; a precise day was adjourned 
to an indefinite term; and his effective army consisted of some German

Finland contained 1,800,000 fighting men, and consequently were far more 
populous than at present.

the state of Europe, enriched with his own observations. That valuable

pilgrims, whom he was obliged to disband with indulgences and alms. 
Regardless of futurity, his successors and the powers of Italy were in- 
volved in the schemes of present and domestic ambition; and the dis- 
tance or proximity of each object determined in their eyes its apparent 
magnitude. A more enlarged view of their interest would have taught 
them to maintain a defensive and naval war against the common enemy; 
and the support of Scanderbeg and his brave Albanians might have pre- 
vented the subsequent invasion of the kingdom of Naples. The siege 
and sack of Otranto by the Turks diffused a general consternation; 
and Pope Sixtus was preparing to fly beyond the Alps, when the storni 
was instantly dispelled by the death of Mohammed the Second, in the 
fifty-first year of his age. 08 His lofty genius aspired to the conquest 
of Italy: he was possessed of a strong city and a capacious harbour.-; 
and the same reign might have been decorated with the trophies of the 
NEW and the ANCIENT ROME."

used the Memorie Istoriche de' Monarchi Ottomanni di Giovanni Sagredq 
(Venezia, 1677, in 4to). In peace and war the Turks have ever engaged 
the attention of the republic of Venice. All her despatches and archives 
were open to a procurator of St Mark, and Sagredo is not contemptible 
either in sense or style. Yet he too bitterly hates the infidels : he is ignorant 
of their language and manners; and his narrative, which allows only seventy 
pages to Mohammed II. (p. 69-140), becomes more copious f and ^ authentic 
as he approaches the years 1640 and 1644, the. term of the historic labours 
of John Sagredo. ^ . r f 

"As I am now taking an everlasting farewell of the Greek empire, I shall 
briefly mention the great collection of Byzantine writers whose names and 
testimonies have been successively repeated in this work. The Greek presses 
of Aldus and the Italians were confined to the classics of a better age; 
and the first rude editions of Procdpius, Agathias, Cedrenus, Zonaras, etc., 
were published by the learned diligence of the Germans. The whole Byzantine 
series (thirty-six volumes in folio) has gradually issued (A.D. 1648, etc.) 
from the 'royal press of the Louvre, with some collateral aid from Rome and 
Leipsic; but the Venetian edition (A.D. 1729), though cheaper and more 
copious, is not less inferior in correctness than in magnificence to that of 
Paris. The merits of the French editors are various; but the valued Anna 
Comnena, Cinnamus, Villehardouin, etc., is enhanced by the historical notes 
of Charles du Fresne du Cange. His supplemental works, the Greek 
Glossary, the Constantinopolis Christiana, the Familiae Byzantraa, diffuse a 
steady light over the darkness of the Lower Empire.

IN the first ages of the decline and fall of the Roman empire our eye 
is invariably fixed on the royal city, which had given laws to the fairest 
portion of the globe. We contemplate her fortunes, at first with ad- 
miration, at length with pity, always with attention; and when that 
attention is diverted from the Capitol to the provinces, they are con- 
sidered as so many branches which have been successively severed from 
the Imperial trunk. The foundation of a second Rome, on the shores 
of the Bosphorus, has compelled. the historian to follow the successors 
of Coristantine; and our curiosity has. been tempted to visit the most 
remote countries of Europe and Asia, to explore the causes and the 
authors of the long decay of the Byzantine monarchy. By the con- 
quests of Justinian we have been recalled to the banks of the Tiber, to 
the deliverance of the ancient metropolis; but that deliverance was a 
change, pr perhaps an aggravation^ of servitude. Rome had been al- 
ready stripped of her trophies, her gods, and her Caesars; nor was the 
Gothic dominion more inglorious and Oppressive than the tyranny of 
the Greeks. In the eighth century of the Christian era a religious quar- 
rel, the worship of images, provoked the Romans to assert their inde- 
pendence: their bishop became the temporal, as well as the spiritual, 
father of a free people; and of the Western empire, which was restored 
by Charlemagne, the title and image still decorate the singular con- 
stitution of modern Germany, The name of Rome must yet command 
our involuntary respect: the climate (whatsoever may be its influence) 
was no longer the same: 1 the purity' of blood had been contaminated 
through a thousand channels; but the venerable aspect of her ruins, 
fcnd the memory of past greatness, rekindled a spark of the national 
character." The darbiess of the middle ages exhibits some scenes not 
unworthy of our notice. Nor shall I dismiss the present work till I 
have reviewed the state and revolutions of the ROMAN CITY, which 
acquiesced under the absolute dominion of the popes about the same 
time that Constantinople was enslaved by the Turkish arms. 

x The abbe" Dubos, who, with less genius than his successor Montesquieu, 
has asserted and magnified the influence of climate, objects to himself the 
degeneracy of the Romans and Batavians. To the first of these examples 
he replies, i. That the change is less real than apparent, and that the 
modern Romans prudently conceal in themselves the virtues of their ancestors.

"Visible alteration (Reflexions sur la Pnpsie &lt;*t nr 1a P*itiHir* nan- ;i &amp;*** v&amp;\ 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 7*7. 

In the beginning of the twelfth century, 2 the era of the first crusade, 
Rome was revered by the Latins as the metropolis of the world, as the 
throne of the pope and the emperor, who, from the eternal city, de- 
rived their title, their honours, and the right or exercise of temporal 
dominion. After so long an interruption it may not be useless to re- 
peat that the successors of Charlemagne and the .Othos were chosen 
beyond the Rhine in a national diet; but that these princes were con- 
tent with the humble names of kings of Germany and Italy till they 
had passed the Alps and the Apennine, to seek their Imperial crown on 
the banks of the Tiber. 3 At some distance from the city their ap- 
proach was saluted by a long procession of the clergy and people with 
palms and crosses; and the terrific emblems of wolves and lions, of 
dragons and eagles, that floated in the military banners, represented the 
departed legions and cohorts of the republic* The royal oath to main- 
tain the liberties of Rome was thrice reiterated, at the bridge, the gate, 
and on the stairs of the Vatican; 4 and tie distribution of a customary 
donative feebly imitated the, magnificence of the first Caesars. In the 
church of St. Peter the coronation was performed by his successor: 5 

*The reader has been so long absent from Rome that I would advise 
him to recollect or review the xlixth chapter of this History. 

*The coronation of the German emperors at Rome, more especially in 
the eleventh century, is best represented from the original monuments by 
Muratori f ( Antiquitat Italiae medii .2Evi, torn. i. dissertat il p. 99, etc.) 
and Cenni (Monument. Domin. Pontif. torn. ii. diss. vi. p. 261), the latter 
of whom I only know from the copious extract of Schmidt (Hist des 
Allemands, torn, iii. p. 255-266). 

* (Gregorovius says, with regard to the thrice repeated oath, " The emperor 
first took an oath to the Romans at the little bridge on the Neronian field 
faithfully to observe the rights and usages of the city. On the day of the 
coronation he made his entrance through the Porta Castella close to St 
Angelo, and here repeated the oath. The clergy and the corporation of 
Rome greeted him at the church of St. Maria Traspontina on a legendary 
site called the Terebenthus of Nero. O. S.J 

' [Gregorovius thus describes the coronation of the kings of Germany 
and Italy, afterwards the emperors of the Holy Roman empire: "Having 
arrived at the steps, the king dismounted and stooped to kiss the pope's 
foot, tendered the oath to be an upright protector of the Church, and was 
adopted by him as the son of 'the Church. With solemn song both king 
and pope entered the church of St, Maria in Turn beside the steps of St 
Peter's, and here the king was formally made canon of the cathedral. He 
then advanced, conducted by the Lateran count of the palace and by the 
primicerius of the judges to the silver door of the cathedral* where he 
prayed, and the bishop of Albano delivered the first oration. Innumerable 
mystic ceremonies awaited the king in St Pefet's itself. Here a short 
way from the entrance was the Rota Porphyretica. a round porphyry 
Stone inserted in the pavement, on which the pope ;and king knelt ^The 
imperial candidate here made his confession of faith; the cardinal bishop 
of Portus placed himself in the middle of tine rota and delivered the 
second oration. The king was then draped in new vestments, was made a 
cleric, in the sacristy by 1 the pope, was clad with a tunic dalmatica, pluviale, 
mitre, and sandals, and was then led to the iltar of St. Maurice, whither 
his wife, after similar but less fatiguing ceremonies, accompanied him. 
The bishop of Ostia here anointed the king on the right arm and the

the voice of God was confounded with that of the people; and the 
public consent was declared in the acclamations of " Long life and vic- 
tory to our lord the pope! long life and victory to our lord the em- 
peror; long life and victory to the Roman and Teutonic armies! " 
The names of Caesar and Augustus, the laws of Constantine and Jus- 
tinian, the example of Charlemagne and Otho, established the supreme 
dominion of the emperors: their title and image was engraved on the 
papal coins; 7 and their jurisdiction was marked by the sword of jus- 
tice, which they delivered to the praefect of the city. But every Ro- 
man prejudice was awakened by the name, the language, and the man- 
ners of a. barbarian lord. The Caesars of Saxony or Franconia were the 
chiefs of a feudal aristocracy; nor could they exercise the discipline of 
civil and military power, which alone secures the obedience of a distant 
people, impatient of servitude, though perhaps incapable of freedom. 
Once, and once only, in his life, each emperor, with an army of Teu- 
tonic vassals, descended from the Alps. I have described the peaceful 
order of his entry and coronation; but that order was commonly dis- 
turbed by the clamour and sedition of the Romans, who encountered 
their sovereign as a foreign invader: his departure was always speedy, 
and often shameful; and, in the absence of a long reign, his authority 
was insulted and his name was forgotten. The progress of independ- 
ence in Germany and Italy undermined the foundations of the Im- 
perial sovereignty, and the triumph of the popes was the deliverance 
of Rome. 

Of her two sovereigns, the emperor had precariously reigned by the 
right of conquest; but die authority of the pope was founded on the 
soft though more solid basis of opinion and habit. The removal of a 
foreign influence restored and endeared the shepherd to his flock. In- 
stead of the arbitrary or venal nomination of a German court, the vicar 
of Christ was freely chosen by the college of cardinals, most of whom 
were either natives or inhabitants of the city. The applause of the 
magistrates and people confirmed his election; and the ecclesiastical 
power that was obeyed in Sweden and Britain had been ultimately de- 
rived from the suffrage of the Romans. The same suffrage gave a 
prince, as well as a pontiff, to the capital. It was universally believed 
that Constantine had invested the popes with the temporal dominion 

and delivered the third oration. After this followed the chief ceremony. 
The pope placed a ring on the king's finger, girt him with a sword, and 
placed the crown on his head. Then the emperor, having taken off these 
symbols, ministered to the pope as sub-deacon at mass. The Count Palatine 
afterwards removed the sandals and put on the red imperial boots, with 
the spurs of St. Maurice, upon him." 0. S.] 

8 Exercitui Romano et Teutonico! The latter was both seen and felt; 
but the former was no more than magni nominis umbra. 

7 Muratori has given the series of the papal coins ( Antiquitat. torn. ii. diss. 
xxvii. p. 548-554)- He finds only two more early than the year 800: fifty 
are still extant from Leo III. to Leo IX. with the addition of the reigning 
emperor; none remain of Gregory VII. or Urban II. ; but in those of 
Paschal II. he seems to have renounced this badge of dependence. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 789 

of Rome; and the boldest civilians, the most profane sceptics, were 
satisfied with disputing the right of the emperor and the validity of his 
gift. The truth of the fact, the authenticity of his donation, was deeply 
rooted in the ignorance and tradition of four centuries; and the fabu- 
lous origin was lost in the real and permanent effects. The name of 
Dominus, or Lord, was inscribed on the coin of the bishops: their title 
was acknowledged by acclamations and oaths of allegiance, and, with 
the free or reluctant consent of the German Caesars, they had long ex- 
ercised a supreme or subordinate jurisdiction over the city and patri- 
mony of St. Peter. The reign of the popes, which gratified the preju- 
dices, was not incompatible with the liberties of Rome; and a more 
critical inquiry would have revealed a still nobler source of their 
power the gratitude of a nation whom they had rescued from the 
heresy and oppression .of the Greek tyrant. In an age of superstition 
it should seem that the union of the royal and sacerdotal characters 
would mutually fortify each other, and that the keys of Paradise would 
be the surest pledge of earthly obedience. The sanctity of the office 
might indeed be degraded by the personal vices of the man. But the 
scandals of the tenth century were obliterated by the austere and more 
dangerous virtues of Gregory the Seventh and his successors; and in 
the ambitious contests which they maintained for the rights of the 
church, their sufferings or their success must equally tend to increase 
the popular veneration. They sometimes wandered in poverty and 
exile, the victims of persecution; and the apostolic zeal with which 
they offered themselves to martyrdom must engage the favour and sym- 
pathy of every Catholic breast. And sometimes, thundering from the 
Vatican, they created, judged, and deposed the longs of the world; nor 
could the proudest Roman be disgraced by submitting to a priest whose 
feet were kissed and whose stirrup was held by the successors of Char- 
lemagne. 8 Even the temporal interest of the city should have pro- 
tected in peace and honour the residence of the popes, from whence a 
vain and lazy people derived the greatest part of their subsistence and 
riches. The fixed revenue of the popes was probably impaired: many 
of the old patrimonial estates, both in Italy and the provinces, had been 
invaded by sacrilegious hands; nor could the loss be compensated by 
the claim, rather than the possession, of the more ample gifts of Pepin 
and his descendants. But the Vatican and Capitol were nourished by 
the incessant and increasing swarms of pilgrims and suppliants: the 
pale of Christianity was enlarged, and the pope and cardinals were 
overwhelmed by the judgment of ecclesiastical and secular causes. A 
new jurisprudence had established in the Latin church the right and 
practice of appeals; and from the North and West the bishops and 

'See Ducange, Gloss, mediae et infimse Latinitat. torn. vi. p. 364 3^5, 
STAFFA. This homage was paid by kings to archbishops, and by vassals 
to their lords (Schmidt, torn. iii. p. 262); and it was the nicest policy of 
Rome to confound the marks of filial and of feudal subjection. 

The appeals from all the churches to the Roman pontiff are deplored 



abbots were invited or summoned to solicit, to complain, to accuse, or 
to justify, before the threshold of the apostles. A rare prodigy is once 
recorded, that two horses, belonging to the archbishops of Mentz and 
Cologne, repassed the Alps, yet laden with gold and silver; 10 but it was 
soon understood that the success, both of the pilgrims and clients, de- 
pended much less on the justice of their cause than on the value of 
their offering. The wealth and piety of these strangers were ostenta- 
tiously displayed, and their expenses, sacred or profane, circulated in 
various channels for the emolument of the Romans. 

Such powerful motives should have firmly attached the voluntary and 
pious obedience of the Roman people to their spiritual and temporal 
father. But the operation of prejudice and interest is often disturbed 
by the sallies of ungovernable passion. The Indian who fells the tree 
that he may gather the fruit, 11 and the Arab who plunders the caravans 
of commerce, are actuated by the same impulse of savage nature, which 
overlooks the future in the present, and relinquishes for momentary 
rapine the long and secure possession of the most important blessings. 
And it was thus that the shrine of St. Peter was profaned by the 
thoughtless Romans, who pillaged the offerings and wounded the pil- 
grims, without computing the number and value of .similar visits, which 
they prevented by their inhospitable sacrilege. Even the influence of 
superstition is fluctuating and precarious; and the slave, whose reason 
is subdued, will often be delivered by his avarice or pride. A credulous 
devotion for the fables and oracles of the priesthood most powerfully 
acts on the mind of a barbarian; yet such a mind is the least capable 
of preferring imagination to sense, of sacrificing to a distant motive, 
to an invisible, perhaps an ideal object, the appetites and interests of 
the present world. In the vigour of health and youth, his practice will 
perpetually contradict his belief, till the pressure of age, or sickness, 
or calamity, awakens his terrors, and compels him to satisfy the double 
debt of piety and remorse. I have already observed that the modern 
times of religious indifference are the most favourable to the peace and 
security of the clergy. Under the reign of superstition they had much 
to hope from the ignorance, and much to fear from the violence, of 
mankind. The wealth, whose constant increase must have rendered 
them the sole proprietors of the earth, was alternately bestowed by the 

by the zeal of St. Bernard (de Consideration^ 1. iii. torn. ii. p. 431-442. edit. 
Mabillpn, Venet 1750) and the judgment of Fleury (Discotirs stir rHist. 
Ecclesiastique, iv. et vii.). But, the saint, who believed in the false decretals, 
condemns only the abuse of these appeals; the more enlightened historian 
investigates the origin and rejects the principles of this new jurisprudence.

repentant father and plundered by the rapacious soh: their persons 
were adored or violated; and the same idol, by the hands of the same 
votaries, was placed on the altar or trampled in the dust. In the feudal 
system of Europe, arms were the title of distinction and the measure of 
allegiance; and amidst their tumult the still voice of law and reason 
was seldom heard or obeyed. The turbulent Romans disdained the 
yoke and insulted the impotence of their bishop; 12 nor would his edu- 
cation or character allow him to exercise, with decency or effect, the 
power of the sword. The motives of his election and the frailties of his 
life were exposed to their familiar observation; and proximity must 
dimmish the reverence which his name and his decrees impressed on a 
barbarous world. This difference has not escaped the notice of our 
philosophic historian: " Though the name and authority of the court of 
Rome were so terrible in the remote countries of Europe, which were 
sunk in profound ignorance and were entirely unacquainted with its 
character and conduct, the pope was so little revered at home, that his 
inveterate enemies surrounded the gates of Rome itself, and even con- 
trolled his government in that city; and the ambassadors, who from a 
distant extremity of Europe carried to him the humble, or rather ab- 
ject, submissions of the greatest potentate of the age, found the utmost 
difficulty to make their way to him and to throw themselves at his 
feet." 18 

Since the primitive times the wealth of the popes was. exposed to 
envy, their power to opposition, and their persons to violence. But 
the long hostility of the mitre and the crown increased the numbers 
and inflamed the passions of their enemies. The deadly factions of the 
Guelphs and Ghibelines, so fatal to Italy, could never be embraced with 
truth or constancy by the Romans, the subjects and adversaries both 
of the bishop and emperor; but their support was solicited by both par- 
ties, aftd they alternately displayed in their banners the keys of St* 
Peter and the German eagle. Gregory the Seventh who may be adored 
or detested as the founder of the papal monarchy, was driven from

bishop elect, to be castrated, and made all their testicles be brought him

Rome, and died in exile at Salerno. Six-and-thirty of his successors, 14 
till their retreat to Avignon, maintained an unequal contest with the 
Romans: their age and dignity were often violated; and the churches, 
in the solemn rites of religion, were polluted with sedition and murder. 
A repetition 15 of such capricious brutality, without connection or de- 
sign, would be tedious and disgusting; and I shall content myself with 
some events of the twelfth century which represent the state of the 
popes and the city. On Holy Thursday, while Paschal officiated before 
the altar, he was interrupted by the clamours of the multitude, who im- 
periously demanded the confirmation of a favourite magistrate. His 
silence exasperated their fury: his pious refusal to mingle the affairs 
of earth and heaven was encountered with menaces and oaths that he 
should be the cause and the witness of the public ruin. During the 
festival of Easter, while the bishop and the clergy, barefoot and in pro- 
cession, visited the tombs of the martyrs, they were twice assaulted, at 
the bridge of St. Angelo and before the Capitol, with volleys of stones 
and darts. The houses of his adherents were levelled with the ground: 
Paschal escaped with difficulty and danger; he levied an army in the 
patrimony of St. Peter, and his last days were embittered by suffering 
and inflicting the calamities of civil war. The scenes that followed the 
election of his successor Gelasius the Second were still more scandalous 
to the church and city. Cencio Frangipani, 16 a potent and factious 
baron, burst into the assembly furious and in arms: the cardinals were 
stripped, beaten, and trampled under foot; and he seized, without pity 
or respect, the vicar of Christ by the throat. Gelasius was dragged by 
his hair along the ground, buffeted with blows, wounded with spurs, 
and bound with an iron chain in the house of his brutal tyrant. An 
insurrection of the people delivered their bishop: the rival families op- 
posed the violence of the Frangipani; and Cencio, who sued for pardon, 
repented of the failure, rather than of the guilt, of his enterprise. Not 
many days had elapsed when the pope was again assaulted at the altar. 

"From Leo IX. and Gregory VII. an authentic and contemporary series 
of the lives of the popes by the Cardinal of Arragon, Pandulphus Pisanus, 
Bernard Guido, etc., is inserted in the Italian Historians of Muratori 
(torn. iii. P. i. p. 277-685), and has been always before my eyes. 

18 Throughout this chapter the Annals of Muratori have been my ordinary 
and excellent guide. Muratori uses, and indeed quotes with the freedom of a 
master, his great Collection of the Italian Historians in twenty-eight volumes ; 
and as that treasure is in my library, I have thought it an amusement, if 
not a duty, to consult the originals. 

18 1 cannot refrain from transcribing the high-coloured words of Pandul- 
phus Pisanus (p. 384) : Hoc audiens inimicus pacis atque turbator jam

THE ROMAN EMPIRE 793 

While his friends and enemies were engaged in a bloody contest, he 
escaped in his sacerdotal garments. In this unworthy flight, which ex- 
cited the compassion of the Roman matrons, his attendants were scat 
tered or unhorsed; and, in the fields behind the church of St. Peter, his 
successor was found alone and half dead with fear and fatigue. Shak- 
ing the dust from his feet, the apostle withdrew from a city in which 
his dignity was insulted and his person was endangered; and the vanity 
of sacerdotal ambition is revealed in the involuntary confession that 
one emperor was more tolerable than twenty. 17 These examples might 
suffice; but I cannot forget the sufferings of two pontiffs of the same 
age, the second and third of the name of Lucius. The former, as he 
ascended in battle-array to assault the Capitol, was struck on the tern 
pie by a stone, and expired in a few days; the latter was severely 
wounded in the persons of his servants. In a ciyil commotion several 
of his priests had been made prisoners; and the inhuman Romans, re* 
serving one as a guide for his brethren, put out their eyes, crowned 
them with ludicrous mitres, mounted them on asses with their faces to 
the tail, and extorted on oath that, in this wretched condition, they 
should offer themselves as a lesson to the head of the church. Hope 
or fear, lassitude or remorse, the characters of the men and the circum- 
stances of the times, might sometimes obtain an interval of peace and 
obedience; and the pope was restored with joyful acclamations to the 
Lateran or Vatican, from whence he had been driven with threats and 
violence. But the root of mischief was deep and perennial; and a 
momentary calm was preceded and followed by such tempests as had 
almost sunk the bark of St. Peter. Rome continually presented the 
aspect of war and discord: the churches and palaces were fortified and 
assaulted by the factions and families; and, after giving peace to Eu- 
rope, Calistus the Second alone had resolution and power to prohibit the 
use of private arms in the metropolis. Among the nations who revered 
the apostolic throne, the tumults of Rome provoked a general indigna- 
tion; and, in a letter to his disciple Eugenius the Third, St. Bernard, 
with the sharpness of his wit and zeal, has stigmatised the vices of the 
rebellious people. 18 " Who is ignorant," says the monk of Clairvaux, 
" of the vanity and arrogance of the Romans? a nation nursed in sedi- 
tion, cruel, untractable, and scorning to obey, unless they are too feeble 
to resist. When they promise to serve, they aspire to reign; if they 
swear allegiance, they watch the opportunity of revolt; yet they vent 
their discontent in loud clamours if your doors or your counsels are shut 
against them. Dexterous in mischief, they have never learnt the sci- 
ence of doing good. Odious to earth and heaven, impious to God, sedi-

tiotis among themselves, jealous of their neighbours, inhuman to stran- 
gers, they love no one, by no one are they beloved; and while they wish 
to inspire fear, they live in base and continual apprehension. They 
Will not submit: they know not how to govern; faithless to their su- 
periors, intolerable to their equals, ungrateful to their benefactors, and 
alike impudent in their demands and their refusals. Lofty in promise, 
poor in execution: adulation and calumny, perfidy and treason, are the 
familiar arts of their policy." Surely this dark portrait is not coloured 
by the pencil of Christian charity; 19 yet the features, however harsh 
and ugly, express a lively resemblance of the Romans of the twelfth 
century. 20 

The Jews had rejected the Christ when he appeared among them in 
a plebeian character; and the Romans might plead their ignorance of 
his vicar when he assumed the pomp and pride of a temporal sover- 
eign. In the busy age of the crusades some sparks of curiosity and 
reason were rekindled in the Western world: the heresy of Bulgaria, 
the Paulician sect, was successfully transplanted into the soil of Italy 
and France; the Gnostic visions were mingled with the simplicity of 
the Gospel; and the enemies of the clergy reconciled their passions with 
their conscience, the desire of freedom with the profession of piety. 81 
The trumpet of Roman liberty was first sounded by Arnold of Brescia, 22 
whose promotion in the church was confined to the lowest rank, and 
who wore the monastic habit rather as a garb of poverty than as a uni- 
form of obedience. His adversaries could not deny the wit and elo- 
quence which they severely felt: they confess with reluctance the spe- 
cious purity of his morals; and his errors were recommended &lt;to the 
public by a mixture of important and beneficial truths. In his theo- 
logical studies he had been the disciple of the famous and unfortunate 
Abelard, 23 who was likewise involved in the suspicion of heresy: but 

*As a Roman citizen, Petrarch takes leave to observe that Bernard, 
though a saint, was a man; that he might be provoked by resentment, and 
possibly repent of his hasty passion, etc. (Memoires sur la Vie de Ptrarque, 
torn. i. p. 330.) 

*Baronius, m his index to the twelfth volume of his Annals, has found 
a fair and easy excuse. He makes two heads, of Romani Catholic* and 
Schismatic*: to the former he applies all the good, to the latter all the evil, 
that is told of the city. 

81 The heresies of the twelfth century may be found in Mosheim (Institut. 
Hist. Eccles. p. 419-427), who entertains a favourable opinion -of Arnold 
of Brescia. I have already described the sect of the Paulicians, and 
followed their migration from Armenia to Thrace and Bulgaria. Italy and 
France. 

"The original pictures of Arnold of Brescia are drawn by Otho bishop 
of Frisingen (Chron. 1. vii. c. 31, de Gestis Frederici I. 1. i. c. 27, 1. ii. c. 21), 
and in the third book of the Ligurinus, a poem of Gunther, who flourished 
A.D. 1200, in .the monastery of Paris near Basil (Fabric. Biblioth. Latia 
ined. et infimae ^Etatis, torn. iii. p. 174, 175). The long passage that relates 
to Arnold is produced by Guilliman (de Rebus Helveticus, 1. iii. c. 5, p. 108). 
The wicked wit of Bayle was amused in composing, with much levity 
and learning, the -articles of ABELARD, FOULQUES, HELOISE, in his Diction- 
naire Critiaue. The dispute of Abelard and St Bernard, of scholastic and 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 79!, 

the lover of Eloisa was of a soft and flexible nature; and his ecclesiastic 
judges were edified and disarmed by the humility of his repentance. 
From this master Arnold most probably imbibed some metaphysical 
definitions of the Trinity, repugnant to the taste of the times; his ideas 
of baptism and the eucharist are loosely censured; but a political heresy 
was the source of his fame and misfortunes. He presumed to quote 
the declaration of Christ, that his kingdom is not of this world: he 
boldly maintained that the sword and the sceptre were intrusted to the 
civil magistrate; that temporal honours and possessions were lawfully 
vested in secular persons; that the abbots, the bishops, and the pope 
himself,- must renounce either their state or their salvation; and that, 
after the loss of their revenues, the voluntary tithes and oblations of 
the faithful would suffice, not indeed for luxury and avarice, but for a 
frugal life in the exercise of spiritual labours. During a short tune the 
preacher was revered as a patriot; and the discontent, or revolt, or 
Brescia against her bishop, was the first fruits of his dangerous lessons. 
But the favour of the people is less permanent than the resentment of 
the priest; and after the heresy of Arnold had been condemned by 
Innocent the Second, 2 * in the general council of the Lateran, the magis- 
trates themselves were urged by prejudice and fear to execute the sen- 
tence of the church. Italy could no longer afford a refuge; and the 
disciple of Abelard escaped beyond the Alps, till he found a safe and 
hospitable shelter in Zurich, now the first of the Swiss cantons. From 
a Roman station, 25 a royal villa, a. chapter of noble virgins, Zurich had 
gradually increased to a free and flourishing city; where the appeals of. 
the Milanese were sometimes tried by the Imperial commissaries. 20 
In an age less ripe for reformation the precursor of Zuinglius was heard 
with applause: a brave and simple people imbibed, and long retained, 
the colour of his opinions; and his art, or merit, seduced the bishop of 
Constancy, and even the pope's legate, who forgot, for his sake, the in- 
terest of their master and their order. Their tardy zeal was quickened

by the fierce exhortations of St. Bernard; 27 and the enemy of the 
church was driven by persecution to the desperate measure of erecting 
his standard in Rome itself, in the face of the successor of St. Peter. 
Yet the courage of Arnold was not devoid of discretion: he was pro- 
tected, and had perhaps been invited, by the nobles and people; and in 
the service of freedom his eloquence thundered over the seven hills. 
Blending in the same discourse the texts of Livy and St. Paul, uniting 
the motives of Gospel and of classic enthusiasm, he admonished the 
Romans how strangely their patience and the vices of the clergy had 
degenerated from the primitive times of the church and the city. He 
exhorted them to assert the inalienable rights of men and Christians; to 
restore the laws and magistrates of the republic; to respect the name of 
the emperor; but to confine their shepherd to lie spiritual government 
of his flock. 28 Nor could his spiritual government escape the censure 
And control of the reformer; and the inferior clergy were taught by his 
lessons to resist the cardinals, who had usurped a despotic command 
over the twenty-eight regions or parishes of Rome. 29 The revolution 
was not accomplished without rapine and violence, the effusion of blood 
and the demolition of houses: the victorious faction was enriched with 
the spoils of the clergy and the adverse nobles. Arnold of Brescia 
enjoyed, or deplored, the effects of his mission: his reign continued 
above ten years, while two popes, Innocent the Second and Anastasius 
the Fourth, either trembled in the Vatican or wandered as exiles in the 
adjacent cities. They were succeeded by a more vigorous and fortunate 
pontiff, Adrian the Fourth, 30 the only Englishman who has ascended 
the throne of St. Peter; and whose merit emerged from the mean con- 
dition of a monk, and almost a beggar, in the monastery of St. Albans. 
On the first provocation, of a cardinal killed or wounded in the streets, 
he cast an interdict on the guilty people: and from Christmas to Easter 
Rome was deprived of the real or imaginary comforts of religious wor- 
ship. The Romans had despised their temporal prince; they submitted 
with grief and terror to the censures of their spiritual father; their guilt 
was expiated by penance, and the banishment of the seditious preacher

tives he drops a precious acknowledgement, qui, utinam quam sanae esset

acquisition for the church.

Nor is the poetry of Gunther different from the prose of Otho. 

"See Baronius (A.D. 1148, No. 38, 39) from the Vatican MSS. He 
loudly condemns Arnold (A.D. 1141, No, 3) as the father of the political 
heretics, whose influence then hurt him in France.

was the price of their absolution. But the revenge of Adrian was yet 
unsatisfied, and the approaching coronation of Frederic Barbarossa was 
fatal to the bold reformer, who had offended, though not in an equal 
degree, the heads of the church and state. In their interview at Vi- 
terbo, the pope represented to the emperor the furious, ungovernable 
spirit of the Romans: the insults, the injuries, the fears, to which his 
person and his clergy were continually exposed; and the pernicious ten- 
dency of the heresy of Arnold, which must subvert the principles of 
civil, as well as ecclesiastical, subordination. Frederic was convinced 
by these arguments, or tempted by the desire of the Imperial crown; in 
the balance of ambition the innocence or life of an individual is of 
small account; and their common enemy was sacrificed to a moment of 
political concord. After his retreat from Rome, Arnold had been pro- 
tected by the viscounts of Campania, from whom he was extorted by 
the power of Caesar: the prsefect of the city pronounced his sentence: 
the martyr of freedom was burnt alive in the presence of a careless and 
ungrateful people; and his ashes were cast into the Tiber, lest the 
heretics should collect and worship the relics of their master. 81 The 
clergy triumphed in his death: with his ashes his sect was dispersed; 
his memory still lived in the minds of the Romans. From his school 
they had probably derived a new article of faith, that the metropolis 
of tiie Catholic church is exempt from the penalties of excommunication 
and interdict. Their bishops might, argue that the supreme jurisdiction, 
which they exercised over kings and nations, more specially embraced 
the city and diocese of the prince of the apostles. But, they preached 
to the Winds, and the same principle that weakened the effect, must 
temper the abuse, of the thunders of the Vatican. 

The love of ancient freedom has encouraged a belief that as early as 
the tenth century, in their first struggles against the Saxon Othos, the 
commonwealth was vindicated and restored by the senate and people 
of Rome; that two consuls were annually elected among the nobles, and 
that ten or twelve plebeian magistrates revived the name and office of 
the tribunes of the commons. 32 But this venerable structure disappears 
before the light of criticism. In the darkness of the middle ages the 
appellations of senators, of consuls, of the sons of consuls, may some- 
times be discovered. 83 They were bestowed by the emperors, or as- 

n Besides the historian and poet already quoted, the last adventures of 
Arnold are related by the biographer of Adrian IV. (Muratori, Script 
Rerum Ital. torn. iii. P. i. p. 441, 443.) m

sumed by the most powerful citizens, to denote their rank, their 
ours, 84 and perhaps the; claim of a pure and patrician descent: but they 
float on the surface, without a series or a substance, the titles of men, 
not the orders of government; 35 and it is only from the year of Christ 
one thousand one hundred and forty-four that the establishment of the 
senate is dated, as a glorious era, in the acts of the city. A new consti- 
tution was hastily framed by private ambition or popular enthusiasm; 
nor could Rome, in the twelfth century, produce an antiquary to ex- 
plain, or a legislator to restore, the harmony and proportions of the 
ancient model. The assembly of a free, or an armed, people, will ever 
speak in loud and weighty acclamations. But the regular distribution 
of the thirty-five tribes^ the nice balance of the wealth and numbers of 
the centuries, the debates of the adverse orators, and the slow operation 
of votes and ballots, could not easily be adapted by a blind multitude, 
ignorant of the arts, and insensible of the benefits, of legal government. 
It was proposed by Arnold to revive and discriminate the equestrian 
order; but what could be the motive or measure of such distinction? 3C 
The pecuniary qualification of the knights must have been reduced to 
the poverty of the times: those times no longer required their civil 
functions of judges and farmers of the revenue; and their primitive 
duty, their military service on horseback, was more nobly supplied by 
feudal tenures and the spirit of chivalry. The jurisprudence of the re- 
public was xiseless and unknown; the nations and families of Italy who 
lived under the Roman and barbaric laws were insensibly mingled in a 
common mass; snd some faint tradition, some imperfect fragments, 
preserved the memory of the Code and Pandects of Justinian. With 
their liberty the Romans might doubtless have restored the appellation 
and office of consuls, had they not disdained a title so promiscuously 
adopted hi the Italian cities, that it has finally settled on the humble 
station of the agents of commerce in a foreign land. But the rights of 

Gratianus in Dei nomine consul et dux, Georgius consul et dux; and in 
1015, Romanus, brother of Gregory VIII., proudly, but vaguely, styles 
himself consul et dux et omnium Romanorum senator. 

34 As late as the tenth century the Greek emperors conferred on the dukes 
of Venice, Naples, Amalphi, etc., the title of toraros or consuls (see Chron, 
Sagornini, passim) ; and the successors of Charlemagne would not abdicate 
any of their prerogative. But in general the names of consul and senator, 
which may be found among the French and Germans, signify no more 
than count and lord (Signevr, Ducange, Glossar.). The monkish writers 
are often ambitious of fine classic words. 

85 The most constitutional form is a diploma of Otho III. (A.D. 998), 
Consulibus senatus populique Roman! ; but the act is probably spurious. 
At the coronation of Henry I., A.D. 1014, the historian Dithmar (apud 
Muratori, Dissert xxiii.) describes him, a senatoribus duodecim vallatum, 
quorum sex rasi barba, alii prolixa, mystice incedebant cum baculis. The 
senate is mentioned in the panegyric of Berengarius (p. 406). 

M In the ancient Rome the equestrian order was not ranked with the 
senate and people as a third branch of the republic till the consulship of 
Cicero, who assumes the merit of the establishment (Plin. Hist Natur. 
xxxiii. 3 [8]; Beaufort, Republique Romaine, torn, i. p. 144-155). 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 799 

the tribunes, the formidable word that arrested the public counsels, 
suppose or must produce a legitimate democracy. The old patricians 
were the subjects, the modern barons the tyrants, of th&amp; state; nor 
would the enemies of peace and order, who insulted the vicar of Christ, 
have long respected the unarmed sanctity of a plebeian magistrate. 81 
In the revolution of the twelfth century, which gave a new existence 
and era to Rome, we may observe the real and important events that 
marked or confirmed her political independence. I. The Capitoline 
hill, one of her seven eminences, 38 is about four hundred yards in length, 
and two hundred in breadth. A flight of a hundred steps led to the 
summit of the Tarpeian rock; and far steeper was the ascent before the 
declivities had been smoothed and the precipices filled by the ruins of 
fallen edifices. From the earliest ages the Capitol had been used as a 
temple in peace, a fortress in war: after the loss of the city it main- 
tained a siege against the victorious Gauls; and the sanctuary of the 
empire was occupied, assaulted, and burnt, in the civil wars of Vitellius 
and Vespasian. 80 The temples of Jupiter and his kindred deities had 
crumbled into dust; their place was supplied by monasteries and houses; 
and the. solid walls, the long and shelving porticoes, were decayed or 
ruined by the lapses of time. It was the first act of the; Remaps, an act 
of freedom, to restore the strength, though wt the. beauty, Qf the Capi- 
tol; to fortify the seat of their arms and counsels; and as often as they 
ascended the hill, the coldest minds must have glowect with the remem- 
brance of their ancestors. II. The first Caesars had been invested with 
the exclusive coinage of the gold and silver; to the senate they Aban- 
doned, the baser metal of bronze or copper: 40 the emblems and legends 

91 The republican plan of Arnold of Brescia is thus stated by Gunther :

But of these reformations some were no more than ideas, others no more 
than words. 

w After many disputes among the antiquaries of Rome, it seems deter- 
mined that the summit of the Capitojtoie hill next the river is strictly the 
Mons Tarpeius, the Arx; and that on the other summit, the church and. 
convent of Araceli, the barefoot friars of St Francis occupy the temple of 
Jupiter (Nardini, Roma Antica, 1. v. c, 11-16). 

[This view is not correct All the chief modern writers on Rome and 
its topography maintain that the Arx was the north-eastern summit, now 
occupied by the church of St. Maria in Aracoeli; while both the Tarpeian 
Rock and the Temple of Jupiter were on the western height The site of 
the temple or the Capitolium is now occupied by the Palazzo Caffarelh, in 
the gardens of which excavations have been carried on. -O. S.j

were inscribed on a more ample field by the genius of flattery; and the 
prince was relieved from the care of celebrating his own virtues. The 
successors of Diocletian despised even the flattery of the senate: their 
royal officers at Rome, and in the provinces, assumed the sole direction 
of the mint; and the same prerogative was inherited by the Gothic 
kings of Italy, and the long series of the Greek, the French, and the 
German dynasties. After an abdication of eight hundred years the 
Roman senate asserted this honourable and lucrative privilege; which 
was tacitly renounced by the popes, from Paschal the Second to the 
establishment of their residence beyond the Alps. Some of these re- 
publican coins of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries are shown in the 
cabinets of the curious. On one of these, a gold medal, Christ is de- 
pictured holding in his left hand a book with this inscription: "THE 
vow OF THE ROMAN SENATE AND PEOPLE: ROME THE CAPITAL OF THE 
WORLD; " on the reverse, St. Peter delivering a banner to a kneeling 
senator in his cap and gown, with the name and arms of his family im- 
pressed on a shield. 41 III. With the empire, the praefect of the city 
had declined to a municipal officer; yet he still exercised in the last ap- 
peal the civil and criminal jurisdiction; and a drawn sword, which he 
received from the successors of Otho, was tie mode of his investiture 
and the emblem of his functions. 42 The dignity was confined to the 
noble families of Rome: the choice of the people was ratified by the 
pope; but a triple oath of fidelity must have often embarrassed the 
praefect in the conflict of adverse duties. 43 A servant, in whom they 
possessed but a third share, was dismissed by the independent Romans: 
in his place they elected a patrician; but this title, which Charlemagne 
had not disdained, was too lofty for a citizen or a subject; and after 
the first fervour of rebellion, they consented without reluctance to the 
restoration of the praefect. About fifty years after this event, Innocent 
the Third, the most ambitious or at least the most fortunate of the 
pontiffs, delivered the Romans and himself from this badge of foreign 
dominion: he invested the prsefect with a banner instead of a sword, 

41 In his twenty-seventh dissertation on the Antiquities of Italy (torn. ii. 
P- 559-569) Muratori exhibits a series of the senatorian coins, which bore 
the obscure names of Affortiati, Infortiati, Prowsini, Paparini. During 
this period, all the popes, without excepting Boniface VIII., abstained from 
the right of coining, wnich was resumed by his successor Benedict XL 
and regularly exercised in the court of Avignon. 

*A German historian, Gerard of Reicherspeg (in Baluz. Miscell. torn. v. p. 
64, apud Schmidt, Hist, des Allemands, torn. iii. p. 265), thus describes 
the constitution of Rome in the eleventh century: Grandiora urbis et orbis 
negotia spectant ad Romanum pontificem itemque ad Romanum Imperatorem, 
sive illius vicarium urbis prsefectum, qui de sua dignitate respicit utrumque, 
videlicet dominum papam cui facit hominjum, et domirmm imperatorem a quo 
accipit suse potestatis insigne, scilicet gladium exertum.

and absolved him from all dependence of oaths or service to the German 
emperors. 44 In his place an ecclesiastic, a present or future cardinal, 
was named by the pope to the civil government of Rome; but his jur- 
isdiction has been reduced to a narrow compass; and in the days of 
freedom the right or exercise was derived from the senate and people. 
IV. After the revival of the senate, 45 the conscript fathers (if I may 
use the expression) were invested with the legislative and executive 
power; but their views seldom reached beyond the present day; and 
that day was most frequently disturbed by violence and tumult. In its 
utmost plenitude the order or assembly consisted of fifty-six senators,** 
the most eminent of whom were distinguished by the title of coun- 
sellors: they were nominated, perhaps annually, by the people; and a 
previous choice of their electors, ten persons in each region, or parish, 
might afford a basis for a free and permanent constitution. The popes, 
who in this tempest submitted rather to bend than to break, confirmed 
by treaty the establishment and privileges of the senate, and expected 
from time, peace, and religion, the restoration of their government. The 
motives of public and private interest might sometimes draw from the 
Romans an occasional and temporary sacrifice of their claims; and they 
renewed their oath of allegiance to the successor of St. Peter and Con- 
stantine, the lawful head of the church and the republic. 47 

The union and vigour of a public council was dissolved in a lawless 
city; and the Romans soon adopted a more strong and simple mode of 
administration. They condensed the name and authority of the senate 
in a single magistrate or two colleagues; and as they were changed at 
the end of a year, or of six months, the greatness of the trust was com- 
pensated by the shortness of the term. But in this transient reign the 
senators of Rome indulged their avarice and ambition: their justice was 
perverted by the interest of their family and faction; and as they pun- 
ished only their enemies, they were obeyed only by their adherents. 
Anarchy, no longer tempered by the pastoral care of their bishop, ad-

monisheck the Romans that they were incapable of governing them*- 
selves;, and they sought abroad those blessings which they were hope-; 
less of finding at home. In the same age, and from the same motives, 
most of the Italian republics were prompted to embrace a measure 
whicfy however strange it may seem, was adapted to their situation, 
and productive of the most salutary effects. 48 They chose, in some for- 
eign, but friendly city, an impartial magistrate of noble birth and un- 
blemished character, a soldier and a statesman, recommended by the 
voice; of fame and his country, to whom they delegated for a time the 
supreme administration of peace and war. The compact between the 
governor and the governed was sealed with oaths and subscriptions^ 
and the duration of his power, the measure of his stipend, the nature 
of their mutual obligations, were defined with scrupulous precision. 
They swore to obey him as their lawful superior: he pledged his faith 
to&gt; unite the indifference of a stranger with the zeal of a patriot. At his 
choice, four or six knights and civilians, his assessors in arms and jus-* 
tiee, attended the Podestb who maintained at his own expense a de- 
cent retinue of servants and horses: his wife, his son, his brother, who 
might bias the affections of the judge, were left behind: during the ex- 
ercise of his office he was not permitted to purchase land, to contract 
an alliance, or even to accept an invitation in the house of a citizen; 
nor could he honourably depart till he had satisfied the complaints that 
might be urged against his government. 

It was. thus* about the middle of the thirteenth century, that the 
Romans called from Bologna the senator Brancaleone, co whose fame 
and? merit have been rescued from oblivion by the pen of an English 
historian^ A just anxiety for his reputation, a clear foresight of the 
difficulties of the task, had engaged him to refuse the honour of their 
choice:: the statutes of Rome were suspended, and his office prolonged 
to the term of three years* By the guilty and licentious he was accused 
as cruel; by the clergy he was suspected as partial; but the friends of 
peace and order applauded the firm and upright magistrate by whom 
those blessings were restored. No criminals were so powerful as to 
brave, so obscure as to elude, the justice of the senator. By his sen- 
tence two nobles of the Annibaldi family were executed on a gibbet; 
and he inexorably demolished, in the city and neighbourhood, one hun- 

* ( *Muratori ('dissert, xlv. torn. iv. p. 64-92) has fully explained this mode 
of government; and the Occulus Pastoralis, which he has given at the end, 
is a treatise or sermon on the duties of these foreign magistrates, 

40 In the Latin writers, at least of the silver age, the title of Potestas was 
transferred from 'the office to the magistrate: 

Hfcjus qui trahitur prsetextam sumere mavis; 
An Fidenarum Gabiorumque esse Potestas. 

, .. (Juvenal. Satir. x. 99.) 

80 See the life and death of Brancaleone. in the Historia Major of Matthew 
Paris, p. 741, 757, 792, 797, 799, 810, 823, 833, 836, 840. The multitude 
of pilgrims and suitors connected Rome and St. Alban's, and the resentment 
of the English clergy prompted them to rejoice whenever the popes were 
humbled and oppressed.

dred and forty towers, the strong shelters of rapine and misdjiei. Thtf 
bishop, as a simple bishop, was compelled to reside in his diocese; and 
the standard of Brancaleone was displayed in the field with terror and 
effect. His services were repaid by the ingratitude of a people un- 
worthy of the happiness which they enjoyed. By the public robbers, 
whom he had provoked for their sake, the Romans were excited to de- 
pose and imprison their benefactor; nor would his life have been spared 
if Bologna had not possessed a pledge for his safety. Before his depar- 
ture the prudent senator had required the exchange of thirty hostages 
of the noblest families of Rome: on die news of his danger, and at the 
prayer of his wife, they were more strictly guarded; and Bologna, in the 
cause of honour, sustained the thunders of a papal interdict. This gen- 
erous resistance allowed the Romans to compare the present with the 
past; and Brancaleone was conducted from the prison to the Capitol 
amidst the acclamations of a repentant people. The remainder of his 
government was firm and fortunate; and as soon as envy was appeased 
by death, his head, enclosed in a precious vase, was deposited on a 
lofty column of marble. 61 

The impotence of reason and virtue recommended in Italy a more 
effectual choice: instead of a private citizen, to whom they yielded a 
voluntary and precarious obedience, the Romans elected for their sena- 
tor some prince of independent power, who could defend them from 
their enemies and themselves. Charles of Anjou and Provence, the 
most ambitious and warlike monarch of the age, accepted at the same 
time the kingdom of Naples from the pope and the office of senator 
from the Roman people. 52 As he passed through the city in his road 
to victory he received their oath of allegiance, lodged in the Lateran 
palace, and smoothed in a short visit the harsh features of his despotic 
character. Yet even Charles was exposed to the inconstancy of the 
people, who saluted with the same acclamations the passage of his rival, 
.the unfortunate Conradin; and a powerful avenger, who reigned in the 
Capitol, alarmed the fears and jealousy of the popes. The absolute 
term of his life was superseded by a renewal every third year; and the 
enmity of Nicholas the Third obliged the Sicilian king to abdicate the 
government of Rome. In his bull, a perpetual law, the imperious pon- 
tiff asserts the truth, validity, and use of the donation of Constantine, 
not less essential to the peace of the city than to the independence of 
the church; establishes the annual election of the senator, and formally 

w Matthew Paris thus ends his account: Caput vero ipsius Brancaleonis

valoris et probitatis, quasi reliquias, superstitiose nimis et pompose sus- 
tulerunt Fuerat enim superborum potentum et malefactorum urbis malleus

et amator (p. 840)- A biographer of Innocent IV. (Muraton Script, torn. in. 
P i T&gt; *Qi 502) draws a less favourable portrait of this Ghibelme senator. 

' The election of Charles of Anjou to the office of perpetual senator of 
Rome is mentioned by the historians in the eighth volume of the Collection 
of Muratori, by Nicholas de Jamsilla (p 592), the monk of Padua (p. 724), 
Sabas Malaspina (1. ii. c. 9, p. 808), and Ricordano Malespmi (c, 177, P- 999).

disqualifies all emperors, kings, princes, and persons of an eminent and 
conspicuous rank. 58 This prohibitory clause was repealed in his own 
behaif by Martin the Fourth, who humbly solicited the suffrage of the 
Romans. In the presence, and by the authority, of the people two 
electors conferred, not on the pope, but on the noble and faithful Mar- 
til, the dignity of senator and the supreme administration of the re- 
public, 64 to hold during his natural life, and to exercise at pleasure by 
himself or his deputies. About fifty years afterwards the same title 
was granted to the emperor Lewis of Bavaria; and the liberty of Rome 
was acknowledged by her two sovereigns, who accepted a municipal 
office in the government of their own metropolis. 

In the first moments of rebellion, when Arnold of Brescia had in- 
flamed their minds against the church, the Romans artfully laboured 
to conciliate the favour of the empire, and to recommend their merit 
and services in the cause of Caesar. The style of their ambassadors to 
Conrad the Third and Frederic the First is a mixture of flattery and 
pride, the tradition and the ignorance of their own history. 06 After 
some complaint of his silence and neglect, they exhort the former of 
these princes to pass the Alps, and assume from their hands the Im- 
perial crown. " We beseech your majesty not to disdain the humility 
of your sons and vassals, not to listen to the accusations of our common 
enemies, who calumniate the senate as hostile to your throne, who sow 
the seeds of discord that they may reap the harvest of destruction. The 
pope and the Sicilian are united in an impious league to oppose our 
liberty and your coronation. With the blessing of God our zeal and 
courage has hitherto defeated their attempts. Of their powerful and 
factious adherents, more especially the Frangipani, we have taken by 
assault the houses and turrets: some of these are occupied by our 
troops, and some are levelled with the ground. The Milvian bridge, 
which they had broken, is restored and fortified for your safe passage, 
and your army may enter the city without being annoyed from the 
castle of St. Angelo. All that we have done, and all that we design, is 
for your honour and service, in the loyal hope that you will speedily 
appear in person to vindicate those rights which have been invaded by 

w The high-sounding bull of Nicholas III., which founds his temporal 
sovereignty on the donation of Constantine, is still extant; and as it has 
been inserted by Boniface VIII. in the Sexte of the Decretals, it must be 
received by the Catholics, or at least by the Papists, as a sacred and 
perpetual law. 

**I am indebted to Fleury (Hist. Eccles. torn, xviii. p. 306) for an extract 
of this Roman act, which he has taken from the Ecclesiastical Annals of

Agnes, was daughter of the emperor Henry IV.; and he was half-brother 
and uncle to Conrad III. and Frederic I. He has left, in seven books, a 
Chronicle of the Times; in two, the Gesta Frederic* I., the last of which is

the clergy, to revive the dignity of the empire, and to surpass the fame 
and glory of your predecessors. May you fix your residence in Rome, 
the capital of the world; give laws to Italy and the Teutonic kingdom; 
and imitate the example of Constantine and Justinian, 50 who, by the 
vigour of the senate and people, obtained the sceptre of the earth." 5T 
But these splendid and fallacious wishes were not cherished by Conrad 
the Franconian, whose eyes were fixed on the Holy Land, and who 
died without visiting Rome soon after his return from the Holy Land. 
His nephew and successor, Frederic Barbarossa, was more ambitious 
of the Imperial crown; nor had any of the successors of Otho acquired 
such absolute sway over the kingdom of Italy. Surrounded by his 
ecclesiastical and secular princes, he gave audience in his camp at 
Sutri to the ambassadors of Rome, who thus addressed him in a free 
and florid oration: " Incline yqur ear to the queen of cities; approach 
with a peaceful and friendly mind the precincts of Rome, which has 
cast away the yoke of the clergy, and is impatient to crown her legiti- 
mate emperor. Under your auspicious influence may the primitive times 
be restored. Assert the prerogatives of the eternal city, and reduce un- 
der her monarchy the insolence of the world. You are not ignorant that 
in former ages, by the wisdom of the senate, by the valour and disci- 
pline of the equestrian order, she extended her victorious arms to the 
East and West, beyond the Alps, and over the islands of the ocean. 
By our sins, in the absence of our princes, the noble institution of the 
senate has sunk in oblivion; and with our prudence our strength has 
likewise decreased. We have revived the senate and the equestrian 
order: the counsels of the one, the arms of the other, will be devoted to 
your person and the service of the empire. * Do you not hear the lan- 
guage of the Roman matron? You were a guest, I have adopted you as 
a citizen; a Transalpine stranger, I have elected you for my sovereign,** 
and given you myself, and all that is mine. Your first and most sacred 
duty is to swear and subscribe that you will shed your blood for the 
republic; that you will maintain in peace and justice the laws of the 
city and the charters of your predecessors; and that you will reward 
with five thousand pounds of silver the faithful senators who shall pn&gt; 
claim your titles in the Capitol. With the name assume the character 
of Augustus." The flowers of Latin rhetoric were not yet exhausted; 
but Frederic, impatient of their vanity, interrupted the orators in the 
high tone of royalty and conquest. " Famous indeed have been the for- 
titude and wisdom of the ancient Romans; but your speech is not sea- 
soned with wisdom, and I could wish that fortitude were conspicuous in 
your actions. Like all sublunary things, Rome has felt the vicissitudes 
of time and fortune. Your noblest families were translated to the East,

to the royal city of Constantine; and the remains of your strength and 
freedom have long since been exhausted by the Greeks and Franks. 
Are you desirous of beholding the ancient glory of Rome, the gravity of 
the senate, the spirit of the knights, the discipline of the camp, the 
valour of the legions? you will find them in the German republic. It is 
not empire, naked and alone; the ornaments and virtues of empire have 
likewise migrated beyond the Alps to a more deserving people : BO they 
will be employed in your defence, but they claim your obedience. You 
pretend that myself or my predecessors have been invited by the Ro- 
mans: you mistake the word; they were not invited, they were im- 
plored. From its foreign and domestic tyrants the city was rescued by 
Charlemagne and Otho, whose ashes repose in our country; and their 
dominion was the price of your deliverance. Under that dominion your 
ancestors lived and died. I claim by the right of inheritance and pos- 
session, and who shall dare to extort you from my hands? Is the hand 
of the Frank3 60 and Germans enfeebled by age? Am I vanquished? 
Am I a captive? Am I not encompassed with the banners of a potent 
and invincible army? You impose conditions on your master; you re- 
quire oaths: if the conditions are just, an oath is superfluous; if un- 
just, it is criminal. Can you doubt my equity? It is extended to the 
meanest of my subjects. Will not my sword be unsheathed in the 
defence of the Capitol? By that sword the northern kingdom of Den- 
mark has been rtestored to the Roman empire. You prescribe the meas- 
ure and the objects of my bounty, which flows in a copious but a vol- 
,untary stream. All will be given to patient merit; all will be denied 
to rude importunity." C1 Neither the emperor nor the senate could 
maintain these lofty pretensions of dominion and liberty. United with 
the pope, and suspicious of the Romans, Frederic continued his march 
to the Vatican; his coronation was disturbed by a sally from the Capi- 
tol; and if the numbers and valour of the Germans prevailed in the 
bloody conflict, he could not safely encamp in the presence of a city of 
which he styled himself the sovereign. About twelve years afterwards 
he besieged Rome, to seat an antipope in the chair of St. Peter; and 
twelve Pisafc galleys were introduced into the Tiber; but the senate and 
people were saved by the arts of negotiation and the progress of dis- 
ease; nor did Frederic or his successors reiterate the hostile attempt. 
Their laborious reigns were exercised by the popes, the crusades, and 
the independence of Lombardy and Germany: they courted the alliance 

*Non cessit hobis nudum imperium, virtute sua amicttim venit, orria- 
menta sua secum traxit. Penes nos sunt consules tui, etc. Cicero or Livy 
would not have rejected these images, the eloquence of a barbarian born 
and educated in the Hercynian forest. 

"Otho of Frisiugen, who surely understood the language of the court and 
diet of Germany, speaks of the Franks in the twelfth century as the reigning 
nation (Proceres Franci, equites Franci, manus Francorum) : he adds, 
however, the epithet of Teutonics

of the Romans; and Frederic the Second offered in the Capitol the 
great standard, the Caroccio of Milan. 62 After the extinction of the 
house of Swabia, they were banished beyond the Alps; and their last 
coronations betrayed the impotence and poverty of the Teutonic 
Caesars. 03 

Under the reign of Hadrian, when the empire extended from the 
Euphrates to the ocean, from Mount Atlas to the Grampian hills a 
fanciful historian 4 amused the Romans with the picture of their in- 
fant wars. " There was a time," says Florus, " when Tibur and Prae- 
neste, our summer retreats, were the objects of hostile vows in the Capi- 
tol, when we dreaded the shades of the Arician groves, when we could 
triumph without a blush over the nameless villages of the Sabines and 
Latins, and even Corioli could afford a title not unworthy of a victori- 
ous general." The pride of his contemporaries was gratified by the 
contrast of the past and the present: they would have been humbled by 
the prospect of futurity.; by the prediction that, after a thousand years, 
Rome, despoiled of empire and contracted to her primaeval limits, would 
renew the same hostilities, on the same ground which was then deco- 
rated with her villas and gardens. The adjacent territory on either 
side of the Tiber was always claimed, and sometimes possessed, as the 
patrimony of St. Peter; but the barons assumed a lawless independ- 
ence, and the cities too faithfully copied the revolt and discord of the 
metropolis. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the Romans in- 
cessantly laboured to reduce or destroy the contumacious vassals of the 
church and senate; and if their headstrong and selfish ambition was 
moderated by the pope, he often encouraged their zeal by the alliance 
of his spiritual arms. Their warfare was that of the first consuls and 
dictators, who were taken from the plough. They assembled in arms 
at the foot of the Capitol; sallied from the gates, plundered or burnt 

"From the chronicles of Ricobaldo and Francis Pipin, Muratori (dissert. 
xxvi. torn. ii. p. 492) has transcribed this curious fact with the doggerel 
verses that accompanied the gift:

the harvests of their neighbours, engaged in tumultuary conflict, and 
returned home after an expedition of fifteen or twenty days. Their 
sieges were tedious and unskilful: in the use of victory they indulged 
the meaner passions of jealousy and revenge; and instead of adopting 
the valour, they trampled on the misfortunes, of their adversaries. The 
captives, in their shirts, with a rope round their necks, solicited their 
pardon: the fortifications, and even the buildings, of the rival cities 
were demolished, and the inhabitants were scattered in the adjacent 
villages. It was thus that the seats of the cardinal bishops, Porto, 
Ostia, Albanum, Tusculum, Praeneste, and Tibur or Tivoli, were suc- 
cessively overthrown by the ferocious hostility of the Romans. 05 Of 
these, 06 Porto and Ostia, the two keys of the Tiber, are still vacant and 
desolate: the marshy and unwholesome banks are peopled with herds 
of buffaloes, and the river is lost to every purpose of navigation and 
trade. The hills, which afford a shady retirement from the autumnal 
heats, have again smiled with the blessings of peace; Frascati has 
arisen near the ruins of Tusculum; Tibur or Tivoli has resumed the 
honours of a city; 67 and the meaner towns of Albano and Palestrina 
are decorated with the villas of the cardinals and princes of Rome. In 
the work of destruction, the ambition of the Romans was often checked 
and repulsed by the neighbouring cities and their allies: in the first 
siege of Tibur they were driven from their camp; and the battles of 
Tusculum 6S and Viterbo 60 might be compared in their relative state 
to the memorable fields of Thrasymene and Cannae. In the first of 
these petty wars thirty thousand Romans were overthrown by a thou- 
sand German horse, whom Frederic Barbarossa had detached to the 
relief of Tusculum; and if we number the slain at three, the prisoners 
at two, thousand, we shall embrace the most authentic and moderate 
account. Sixty-eight years afterwards they marched against Viterbo in 
the ecclesiastical state with the whole force of the city; by a rare coali- 
tion the Teutonic eagle was blended, in the adverse banners, with the

Index (the eighteenth volume) of Muratori.

keys of St. Peter; and the pope's auxiliaries were commanded by a 
count of Toulouse and a bishop of Winchester. The Romans were dis- 
comfited with shame and slaughter; but the English prelate must have 
indulged the vanity of a pilgrim, if he multiplied their numbers to one 
hundred, and their loss in the field to thirty, thousand men. Had the 
policy of the senate and the discipline of the legions been restored with 
the Capitol, the divided condition of Italy would have offered the 
fairest opportunity of a second conquest. But in arms the modern Ro- 
mans were not above, and in arts they were far below, the common 
level of the neighbouring republics. Nor was their warlike spirit of 
any long continuance: after some irregular sallies they subsided in the 
national apathy, in the neglect of military institutions, and in the dis^ 
graceful and^dangerous use of foreign mercenaries. 

Ambition is a weed of quick and early vegetation in the vineyard oi 
Christ. Under the first Christian princes the chair of St. Peter was 
disputed by the votes, the venality, the violence, of a popular election: 
the sanctuaries of Rome were polluted with blood; and, from the third 
to the twelfth century, the church was distracted by the mischief of 
frequent schisms. As long as the final appeal was determined by the 
civil magistrate, these mischiefs were transient and local: the merits 
were tried by equity or favour; nor could the unsuccessful competitor 
long disturb the triumph of his rival. But after the emperors had been 
divested of their prerogatives, after a maxim had been established that 
the vicar of Christ is amenable to no earthly tribunal, each vacancy 
of the holy see might involve Christendom in controversy and war, 
The claims of the cardinals and inferior clergy, of the nobles and peo- 
ple, were vague and litigious: the freedom of choice was overruled by 
the tumults of a city that no longer owned or obeyed a superior. On 
the decease of a pope, two factions proceeded in different churches to 
a double election: the number and weight of votes, the priority of 
time, the merit of the candidates, might balance each other: the most 
respectable of the clergy were divided; and the distant princes, who 
bowed before the spiritual throne, could not distinguish the spurious 
from the legitimate idol. The emperors were often the authors of the 
schism, from the political motive of opposing a friendly to a hostile 
pontiff; and each of the competitors was reduced to suffer the insults 
of his enemies, who were not awed by conscience, and to purchase the 
support of his adherents, who were instigated by avarice or ambition. 
A peaceful and perpetual succession was ascertained by Alexander the 
Third, 70 who finally abolished the tumultuary votes of the clergy and 
people, and defined the right of election in the sole college of cardi- 
nals. 71 The three orders of bishops, priests, and deacons, were assimi- 



w See Mosheim, Institut. Histor. Ecclesiast. p. 401, 403. Alexander himself 
had nearly been the victim of a contested election; and the doubtful merits 
of Innocent had only preponderated by the weight of genius and learning 
which St. Bernard cast into the scale (see his life and writings).

lated to each other by this important privilege; the parochial clergy of 
Rome obtained the first rank in the hierarchy: they were indifferently 
chosen among the nations of Christendom; and the possession of the 
richest benefices, of the most important bishoprics, was not incompati- 
ble with their title and office. The senators of the Catholic church, 
the coadjutors and legates of the supreme pontiff, were robed in purple, 
the symbol of martyrdom or royalty; they claimed a proud equality 
with kings; and their dignity was enhanced by the smallness of their 
number, which, till the reign of Leo the Tenth, seldom exceeded twenty 
or twenty-five persons. By this wise regulation all doubt and scandal 
were removed, and the root of schism was so effectually destroyed, that 
in a period of six hundred years a double choice has only once divided 
the unity of the sacred college. But as the concurrence of two-thirds 
of the votes had been made necessary, the election was often delayed 
by the private interest and passions of the cardinals; and while they 
prolonged their independent reign, the Christian world was left desti- 
tute of a head. A vacancy of almost three years had preceded the 
elevation of Gregory the Tenth, who resolved to prevent the future 
abuse; and his bull, after some opposition, has been consecrated in the 
code of the canon law. Nine days are allowed for the obsequies of 
'the -deceased pope, and the arrival of the absent cardinals; on the 
tenth, they are imprisoned, each with one domestic, in a common 
apartment or conclave, without any separation of walls or curtains; a 
small window is reserved for the introduction of necessaries; but the 
door is locked on both sides, and .guarded by the magistrates of the 
city, to seclude them from all correspondence with the world. If the 
election be not consummated in three days, the luxury of their table is 
contracted to a single dish at dinner and supper; and after the eighth 
day they are reduced to a scanty allowance of bread, water, and wine. 
'During the vacancy of the holy see the cardinals are prohibited from 
touching the revenues, or assuming, unless in some rare emergency, the 
government of the church: all agreements and promises among the elec- 
tors are formally annulled; and their integrity is fortified by their sol- 
emn oath and the prayers of the Catholics. Some articles of incon- 
venient or superfluous rigour have been gradually relaxed, but the 
principle of confinement is vigorous .and entire: they are still urged, by 
the personal motives of health and freedom, to accelerate the moment 
of their deliverance; and the improvement of ballot or secret votes has 
wrapped the struggles of the conclave 73 in the silky veil of charity and

college was raised to 'the definite number of seventy-two, to represent, 
under his vicar, the disciples of Christ.

politeness. 74 By these institutions the Romans were excluded from the 
election of their prince and bishop; and in the fever of wild and pre- 
carious liberty, they seemed insensible of the loss of this inestimable 
privilege. The emperor Lewis of Bavaria revived the example of the. 
great Otho. After some negotiation with the magistrates, the Roman 
people was assembled in the square before St. Peter's: the pope of 
Avignon, John the Twenty-second, was deposed: the choice of his suc- 
cessor was ratified by their consent and applause. They freely voted 
for a new law, that their bishop should never be absent more than 
three months in the year, and two days' journey from the city; and. 
that, if he neglected to return on the third summons, the public servant 
should be degraded and dismissed. 7 " But Lewis forgot his own de- 
bility and the prejudices of the times: beyond the precincts of a Ger- 
man camp, his useless phantom was rejected; the Romans despised their 
own workmanship; the antipope implored the mercy of his lawful sov- 
ereign; 77 and the exclusive right of ' the cardinals was more firmly es- 
tablished by this unseasonable attack. 

Had the election been always held in the Vatican, the rights of the 
senate and people would not have been violated with impunity. But 
the Romans forgot, and were forgotten, in the absence of the successors 
of Gregory the Seventh, who did not keep as a divine precept their or- 
dinary residence in the city and diocese. The care of that diocese was 
less important than the government of the universal church; nor could 
the popes delight in a city in which their authority was always op- 
posed, and their person was often endangered. From the persecution- 

but I am at a loss to appreciate the knowledge or authority of an anony- 
mous Italian, whose history (Conclavi de* Pontifici Romani, in 4to, 1667) 
has been continued since the reign of Alexander VII. The accidental 
form of the work furnishes a lesson, though not an antidote, to ambition. 
From a labyrinth of intrigues we emerge to the adoration of the successful 
candidate; but the next page opens with his funeral. 

'*The expressions of Cardinal de Retz are positive and picturesque: On 
y vecut toujours ensemble avec le meme respect et la merne civilite que 
1'on observe dans le cabinet des rois, avec la meme politesse qu'on avoit 
dans la cour de Henri III., avec la meme familiarit que Ton voit dans les- 
colleges; avec la meme modestie qui se remarque dans les noviciats; et 
avec la meme charite*, du moins en apparence, qui pourroit etre entre des.

constitution was temporary, and how much ordinary and permanent. Yet 
it is faintly illustrated by the ancient statutes of Rome. 

"Villani (1. x. c* 68-71, in Muratori, Script torn. xiii. p. 641-645) relates 
this law, and the whole transaction, with much less abhorrence than the

of the emperors, and the wars of Italy, they escaped beyond the Alps' 
into the hospitable bosom of France; from the tumults of Rome they 
prudently withdrew to live and die in the more tranquil stations of 
Anagni, Perugia, Viterbo, and the adjacent cities. When the flock was 
offended or impoverished by the absence of the shepherd, they were 
recalled by a stern admonition, that St. Peter had fixed his chair, not 
in an obscure village, but in the capital of the world; by a ferocious 
menace that the Romans would march in arms to destroy the place and 
people that should dare to afford them a retreat. They returned with 
timorous obedience; and were saluted with the account of a heavy 
debt, of all the losses which their desertion had occasioned, the hire of 
lodgings, the sale of provisions, and the various expenses of servants 
and strangers who attended the court. 78 After a short interval of peace, 
and perhaps of authority, they were again banished by new tumults, 
and again summoned by the imperious or respectful invitation of the 
senate. In these occasional retreats the exiles and fugitives of the 
Vatican were seldom long, or far, distant from the metropolis; but in 
the beginning of the fourteenth century the apostolic throne was trans- 
ported, as it might seem for ever, from the Tiber to the Rhdne; and the 
cause of the transmigration may be deduced from the furious contest 
between Boniface tike Eighth and the king of France. 70 The spiritual 
arms of excommunication and interdict were repulsed by the union of 
the three estates, and the privileges of the Gallican church; but the 
pope was not prepared against the carnal weapons which Philip the 
Fair had courage to employ. As the pope resided at Anagni, without 
the suspicion of danger, his place and person were assaulted by three 
hundred horse, who had been secretly levied by William of Nogaret, a 
French minister, and Sciarra Colonna, of a noble but hostile family of 
Rome. The cardinals fled; the inhabitants of Anagni were seduced 
from their allegiance and gratitude; but the dauntless Boniface, un- 
armed and alone, seated himself in his chair, and awaited, like the con- 
script fathers of old, the swords of the Gauls. Nogaret, a foreign ad- 
versary, was content to execute the orders of his master: by the do- 
mestic enmity of Colonna, he was insulted with words and blows; and 
during a confinement of three days his life was threatened by the hard-

ships which they inflicted on the obstinacy which they provoked. Their 
strange delay gave time and courage to the adherents of the church, 
who rescued him from sacrilegious violence; but his imperious soul was 
wounded in a vital part; and Boniface expired at Rome in a frenzy of 
rage and revenge. His memory is stained with the glaring vices of 
avarice and pride; nor has the courage of a martyr promoted this 
ecclesiastical champion to the honours of a saint; a magnanimous sin- 
ner (say the chronicles of the times), who entered like a fox, reigned 
like a lion, and died like a dog. He was succeeded by Benedict the 
Eleventh, the mildest of mankind. Yet he excommunicated the impious 
emissaries of Philip, and devoted the city and people of Anagni by a 
tremendous curse, whose effects are still visible to the eyes of super- 
stition. 80 

After his decease, the tedious and equal suspense of the conclave was 
fixed by the dexterity of the French faction. A specious offer was made 
and accepted, that, in the term of forty days, they would elect one of 
the three candidates who should be named by their opponents. The 
archbishop of Bordeaux, a furious enemy of his king and country, was 
the first on the list; but his ambition was known; and his conscience 
obeyed the calls of fortune and the commands of a benefactor, who had 
been informed! by a swift messenger that the choice of a pope was now 
in his hands. The terms were regulated in a private interview; and 
with such speed and secrecy was the business transacted, that the unani- 
mous conclave applauded the elevation of Clement the Fifth. 81 The 
cardinals of both parties were soon astonished by a summons to attend 
him beyond the Alps; from whence, as they soon discovered, they must 
never hope to return. He was engaged by promise and affection to 
prefer the residence of France; and, after dragging his court through 
Poitou and Gascony, and devouring, by his expense, the cities and con- 
vents on the road, he finally reposed at Avignon, 82 which flourished 
above seventy years 8! * the seat of the Roman pontiff and the metropo- 

80 It is difficult to know whether Labat (torn. iv. p. 53-57) be in jest or in 
earnest, when he supposes that Anagni still feels the weight of this curse, 
and that the corn-fields, or vineyards, or olive-trees, are annually blasted 
by Nature, the, obsequious handmaid of the popes.

Ha of Christendom. By land, by sea, by the Rh6ne, the position of 
Avignon was on all sides accessible; the southern provinces of France 
do not yield to Italy itself; new palaces arose for the accommodation 
of the pope and cardinals; and the arts of luxury were soon attracted 
by the treasures of the church. They were already possessed of the ad- 
jacent territory, the Venaissin county, 84 a populous and fertile spot; 
and the sovereignty of Avignon was afterwards purchased from the 
youth and distress of Jane, the first queen of Naples, and countess of 
Provence, for the inadequate price of fourscore thousand florins. 85 Un- 
der the shadow of the French monarchy, amidst an obedient people, the 
popes enjoyed an honourable and tranquil state, to which they long had 
been strangers: but Italy deplored their absence; and Rome, in solitude 
and poverty, might repent of the ungovernable freedom which had 
driven from the Vatican the successor of St. Peter. Her repentance 
was tardy and fruitless: after the death of the old members, the sacred 
college was filled with French cardinals, 80 who beheld Rome and Italy 
*with abhorrence and contempt, and perpetuated a series of national, 
and even provincial, popes, attached by the most indissoluble ties to 
their native country. 

The progress of industry had produced and enriched the Italian re- 
publics: the era of their liberty is the most flourishing period of popula- 
tion and agriculture, of manufactures and commerce; and their me- 
chanic labours were gradually refined into the arts of elegance and 
genius. But the position of Rome was less favourable, the territory 
less fruitful: the character of the inhabitants was debased by indolence 
and elated by pride; and they fondly conceived that the tribute of sub- 
jects must for ever nourish the metropolis of the church and empire. 
This prejudice was encouraged in some degree by the resort of pilgrims 
to the shrines of the apostles; and the last legacy of the popes, the in- 
local inconveniences of Avignon are now removed; and many of the vices 
against which the poet declaims had been imported with the Roman court 
by the strangers of Italy (torn. i. p. 23-28). 

**The comtat Venaissin was ceded to the popes in 1273 by Philip III. 
"king of France, after he had inherited the dominions of the count of 
Toulouse, Forty years before, the heresy of Count Raymond had given 
them a pretence of seizure, and they derived some obscure claim from the 
elventh century to some lands citra Rhodanum (Valesii Notitia Galliarum 
p. 459, 610; Longuerue, Description de la France, torn, i, p. 376-381).

might annul the bargain; but the purchase'-money must be refunded, for 
indeed it was paid. Civitatem Avenionem emit . . . per ejusmodi venditionem

and her second husband was ready money, and without it they could not 
"have returned to the throne of Naples.

stitution of the HOLY YEAR, ST was not less beneficial to the people than 
to the clergy. Since the loss of Palestine, the gift of plenary indul- 
gences, which had been applied to the crusades, remained without an 
object; and the most valuable treasure of the church was sequestered 
above eight years from public circulation. A new channel was opened 
by the diligence of Boniface the Eighth, who reconciled the vices of 
ambition and avarice; and the pope had sufficient learning to recollect 
and revive the secular games which were celebrated in Rome at the con- 
clusion of every century. To sound without danger the depth of popu- 
lar credulity, a sermon was seasonably pronounced, a report was art- 
fully scattered, some aged witnesses were produced; and on the first of 
January of the year thirteen hundred the church of St. Peter was 
crowded with the faithful, who demanded the customary indulgence of 
the holy time. The pontiff, who watched and irritated their devout 
impatience, was soon persuaded by ancient testimony of the justice of 
their claim; and he proclaimed a plenary absolution to all Catholics 
who, in the course of that year, and at every similar period, should re- 
spectfully visit the apostolic churches of St. Peter and St. Paul. The 
welcome sound was propagated through Christendom; and at first from 
the nearest provinces of Italy, and at length from the remote kingdoms 
of Hungary and Britain, the highways were thronged with a swarm of 
pilgrims who sought to expiate their sins in a journey, however costly 
or laborious, which was exempt from the perils of military service. All 
exceptions of rank or sex, of age or infirmity, were forgotten in the 
common transport; and in the streets and churches many persons were 
trampled to death by the eagerness of devotion. The calculation of 
their numbers could not be easy nor accurate; and they have probably 
been magnified by a dexterous clergy, well apprised of the contagion of 
example: yet we are assured by a judicious historian, who assisted at 
the ceremony, that Rome was never replenished with less than two hun- 
dred thousand strangers; and another spectator has fixed at two mil 4 
lions the total concourse of the year. A trifling oblation from each in- 
dividual would accumulate a royal treasure; and two priests stood 
night and day, with rakes in their hands, to collect, without counting, 
the heaps of gold and silver that were poured on the altar of St. Paul. 88 
It was fortunately a season of peace and plenty; and if forage was 
scarce, if inns and lodgings were extravagantly dear, an inexhaustible 
supply of bread and wine, of meat and fish, was provided by the policy 
of Boniface and the venal hospitality of the Romans. From a city 
without trade or industry all casual riches will speedily evaporate: but 
the avarice and envy of the next generation solicited Clement the

Sixth f to anticipate the distant period of the century. The gracious 
pontiff complied with their wishes; afforded Rome this poor consolation 
for his loss; and justified the change by the name and practice of the 
Mosaic Jubilee. 00 His summons was obeyed; and the number, zeal, 
and liberality of the pilgrims did not yield to the primitive festival. 
But they encountered the triple scourge of war, pestilence, and famine: 
many wives and virgins were violated in the castles of Italy; and many 
strangers were pillaged or murdered by the savage Romans, no longer 
moderated by the presence of their bishop. 01 To the impatience of the 
popes we may ascribe the successive reduction to fifty, thirty-three, and 
twenty-five years; although the second of these terms is commensurate 
with the life of Christ. The profusion of indulgences, the revolt of the 
Protestants, and the decline of superstition, have much diminished the 
value of the jubilee; yet even the nineteenth and last festival was a year 
of pleasure and profit to the Romans; and a philosophic smile will not 
disturb the triumph of the priest or the happiness of the people. 02 

In the beginning of the eleventh century Italy was exposed to the 
feudal tyranny, alike oppressive to the sovereign and the people. The 
rights of human nature were vindicated by her numerous republics, 
who soon extended their liberty and dominion from the city to the ad- 
jacent country. The sword of the nobles was broken; their slaves were 
enfranchised; their castles were demolished; they assumed the habits 
of society and obedience; their ambition was confined to municipal 
honours; and in the proudest aristocracy of Venice or Genoa, each pa- 
trician was subject to the laws. 93 But the feeble and disorderly gov- 
ernment of Rome was unequal to the task of curbing her rebellious 
sons, who scorned the authority of the magistrate within and without 
the walls. It was no longer a civil contention between the nobles and 
plebeians for the government of the state: the barons asserted in arms 
their personal independence; their palaces and castles were fortified 
against a siege; and their private quarrels were maintained by the num- 
bers of their vassals and retainers. In origin and affection they were

produced, might have renounced these haughty strangers, who dis- 
dained the appellation of citizens, and proudly styled themselves the 
princes of Rome. 05 After a dark series of revolutions all records of 
pedigree were lost; the distinction of surnames was abolished; the blood 
of the nations was mingled in a thousand channels; and the Goths and 
Lombards, the Greeks and Franks, the Germans and Normans, had 
obtained the fairest possessions by royal bounty, or the prerogative of 
valour. These examples might be readily presumed; but the elevation 
of a Hebrew race to the rank of senators and consuls is an event with- 
out a parallel in the long captivity of these miserable exiles. 06 In the 
time of Leo the Ninth a wealthy and learned Jew was converted to 
Christianity; and honoured at his baptism with the name of his god- 
father, the reigning pope. The zeal and courage of Peter the son of 
Leo were signalised in the cause of Gregory the Seventh, who intrusted 
his faithful adherents with the government of Hadrian's mole, the tower 
of Crescentius, or, as it is now called, the castle of St. Angelo. Both 
the father and the son were the parents of a numerous progeny: their 
riches, the fruits of usury, were shared with the noblest families of the 
city; and so extensive was their alliance, that the grandson of the prose- 
lyte was exalted by the weight of his kindred to the throne of St. Peter. 
A majority of the clergy and people supported his cause: he reigned 
several years in the Vatican; and it is only the eloquence of St. Ber- 
nard, and the final triumph of Innocent the Second, that has branded 
Anacletus with the epithet of antipope. After his defeat and death the 
posterity of Leo is no longer conspicuous; and none will be found of the 
modern nobles ambitious of descending from a Jewish stock. It is not 
my design to enumerate the Roman families which have failed at dif- 
ferent periods, or those which are continued in different degrees of 
splendour to the present time. 07 The old consular line of the Frangi- 
pani discover their name in the generous act of breaking or dividing 
bread in a time of famine; and such benevolence is more truly glorious 

w As early as the year 824 the emperor Lothaire L found it expedient to 
interrogate the Roman people, to learn from each individual by what 
national law he chose to be governed (Muratori, Dissert, xxil). 

w Petrarch attacks these foreigners, the tyrants of Rome, in a declama- 
tion or epistle, full of bold truths and absurd pedantry, in which he applies 
the maxims and even prejudices of the old republic to the state of the 
fourteenth century (Memoires, torn. iii. p. 157-169). . . - . 

"The origin and adventures of this Jewish family are noticed by Fagi 
(Critica, torn, iv. p. 435, A.D. 1124, No. 3, 4), who draws his information 
from the Chronographus Maurigniacensis, and Arnulphus Sagiensis de 
Schismate (in Muratori, Script. Ital. torn. iii. P. i. p. 4?3-432). The fact 
must in some degree be true; yet I could wish that it had been coolly 
related before it was turned into a reproach against the antipope. 

* T Muratori has given two dissertations (xli. and xlii.) to the names, sur- 
names, and families of Italy. Some nobles, whb glory in their domestic 
fables, may be offended with his firm and temperate criticism; yet surely 
some ounces of pure gold are of more value than many pounds of base 
metal.

than to have enclosed, with their allies the Corsi, a spacious quarter of 
the city in the chains of their fortifications; the Savelli, as it should 
.seem a Sabine race, have maintained their original dignity; the obsolete 
surname of the Capizucchi is inscribed on the coins of the first senators; 
the Conti preserve the honour, without the estate, of the counts of 
Sigma; and the Annibaldi must have been very ignorant, or very mod- 
est, if they had not descended from the Carthaginian hero. 08 

But among, perhaps above, the peers and princes of the city, I dis- 
tinguish the rival houses of COLONNA and URSINI, whose private story 
is an essential part of the annals of modern Rome. I. The name and 
arms of Colonna 09 have been the theme of much doubtful etymology; 
nor have the orators and antiquarians overlooked either Trajan's pil- 
lar, or the columns of Hercules, or the pillar of Christ's flagellation, or 
the luminous column that guided the Israelites in the desert. Their 
first historical appearance in the year eleven hundred and four attests 
the power and antiquity, while it explains the simple meaning, of the 
name. By the usurpation of Cavse the Colonna provoked the arms of 
Paschal the Second; but they lawfully held in the Campagna of Rome 
the hereditary fiefs of Zagarola and Colonna; and the latter of these 
towns was probably adorned with some lofty pillar, the relic of a villa 
or temple. 100 They likewise possessed one moiety of 'the neighbouring 
city of Tusculum; a strong presumption of their descent from the counts 
*of Tusculum, who in the tenth century were the tyrants of the apos- 
tolic see. According to their own and the public opinion, the primitive 
.and remote source was derived from the banks of the Rhine; 10 * and

-coronation of Boniface VIIL (A.D. 1295) :

the sovereigns of Germany were not ashamed of a real or fabulous af- 
finity with a noble race, which in the revolutions of seven hundred years 
has been often illustrated by merit and always by fortune. 102 About 
the end of the thirteenth century the most powerful branch was com- 
posed of an uncle and six brothers, all conspicuous in arms or in the 
honours of the church. Of these, Peter was elected senator of Rome, 
introduced to the Capitol in a triumphant car, and hailed in some vain 
acclamations with the title of Caesar; while John and Stephen were de- 
clared marquis of Ancona and count of Romagna, by Nicholas the 
Fourth, a patron so partial to their family, that he has been delineated 
in satirical portraits, imprisoned as it were in a hollow pillar. 103 After 
his decease their haughty behaviour provoked the displeasure of the 
most implacable of mankind. The two cardinals, the uncle and the 
nephew, denied the election of Boniface the Eighth; and the Colonna 
were oppressed for a moment by his temporal and spiritual arms. 104 He 
proclaimed a crusade against his personal enemies; their estates were 
confiscated; their fortresses on either side of the Tiber were besieged 
by the troops of St, Peter and those of the rival nobles; and after the 
ruin of Palestrina or Praeneste, their principal seat, the ground was 
marked with a ploughshare, the emblem of perpetual desolation. De* 
graded, banished, proscribed, the six brothers, in disguise and danger, 
wandered over Europe without renouncing the hope of deliverance and 
revenge. In this double hope the French court was their surest asylum: 
they prompted and directed the enterprise of Philip; and I should praise 
their magnanimity had they respected the misfortune -and courage of 
the captive tyrant. His civil acts were annulled by the Roman people, 
who restored the honours and possessions of the Colonna; and some 
estimate may be formed of their wealth by their losses, of their losses 
by the damages of one hundred thousand gold florins which were 
granted them against the accomplices and heirs of the deceased pope, 

says Petrarch; and in 1417 a duke of Guelders and Juliers acknowledges 
(Lenfant. Hist, du Concile de Constance, torn. ii. p. 539) his descent from 
the ancestors of Martin V. (Otho Colonna) : but the royal author of the 
Memoirs of Brandenburg observes that the sceptre in his arms has been 
confounded with the column. To maintain the Roman^ origin of the^Colonna 
it was ingeniously supposed (Diario di Monaldeschi, in the Script Ital, 
torn- xii. p. 533) that a cousin of the emperor Nero escaped from the city and 
founded Mentz in Germany. ^ r 

*"l cannot overlook tho Roman triumph or ovation of Marco Antomo 
Colonna, who had commanded the pope's galleys at the naval victory of 
Lepanto (Thuan. Hist. 1. 7, torn. iii. p., 55, 56; Muret. Oratio x. Opp. i. p. 
180-190).

^Petrarch's attachment to the Colonna has authorised the abbe de bade 
to expatiate on the state of the family in the fourteenth century, the perse-, 
cution of Boniface VIII., the character of Stephen and his sons, their quarreb 
with the IJrsini, etc. (Memoires sur Petrarque, torn* i. p. 98-110, 146-140,. 
I7A-I76 232-230, 275-28o.) His criticism often rectifies the hearsay stpriea 
of Vm'ani, and the errors of the, less diligent moderns. I understand the 
branch of Stephen to be now extinct 



8ao THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

All the spiritual censures and disqualifications were abolished 10 by his 
prudent successors; and the fortune of the house was more firmly es- 
tablished by this transient hurricane. The boldness of Sciarra Colonna 
was signalised in the captivity of Boniface, and long afterwards in the 
coronation of Lewis of Bavaria; and by the gratitude of the emperor 
the pillar in their arms was encircled with a royal crown. But the first 
of the family in fame and merit was the elder Stephen, whom Petrarch 
loved and esteemed as a hero superior to his own times and not un- 
worthy of ancient Rome. Persecution and exile displayed to the na- 
tions his abilities in peace and war; in his distress he was an object, not 
of pity but of reverence; the aspect of danger provoked him to avow 
his name and country; and when he was asked, " Where is now your 
fortress? " he laid his hand on his heart, and answered, " Here." He 
supported with the same virtue the return of prosperity; and, till the 
ruin of his declining age, the ancestors, the character, and the children 
of Stephen Colonna exalted his dignity in the Roman republic and at 
the court of Avignon. II. The Ursini migrated from Spoleto; 100 the 
sons of Ursus, as they are styled in the twelfth century, from some emi- 
nent person who is only known as the father of their race. But they 
were soon distinguished among the nobles of Rome by the number and 
bravery of their kinsmen, the strength of their towers, the honours of 
the senate and sacred college, and the elevation of two popes, Celestin 
the Third and Nicholas the Third, of their name and lineage. 101 Their 
riches may be accused as an early abuse of nepotism: the estates of St. 
Peter were alienated in their favour by the liberal Celestin; 108 and 
Nicholas was ambitious for their sake to solicit the alliance of mon- 

** Alexander III. had declared the Colonna who adhered to the emperor 
Frederic I. incapable of holding any ecclesiastical benefice (Villani, L v. c. i) ; 
and the t last stains of annual excommunication were purified by Sixtus V. 
(Vita di Sisto V. torn. iii. p. 416). Treason, sacrilege, and proscription 
are often the best titles of ancient nobility. 

108 Vallis te proxima misit, 

Appenninigenae qua prata virentia sylvae

Monaldeschi (torn. xii. Script. Ital. p. 533) gives the Ursini a French origin 
which may be remotely true. 

^In the metrical life of Celestin V. by the Cardinal of St. George (Mura- 
tori, torn. iii. P. i. p. 613, etc.) we find a luminous and not inelegant passage 
(1. i. c. 3, P. 203, etc.) :

the Ursini would disdain the nephews of a modern pope.

archs; to found new kingdoms in Lombardy and Tuscany; and to in- 
vest them with the perpetual office of senators of Rome. All that has 
been observed of the greatness of the Colonna will likewise redound to 
the glory of the Ursini, their constant and equal antagonists in the long 
hereditary feud which distracted above two hundred and fifty years the 
ecclesiastical state. The jealousy of pre-eminence and power was the 
true ground of their quarrel; but as a specious badge of distinction, the 
Colonna embraced the name of Ghibelines and the party of the empire; 
the Ursini espoused the title of Guelphs and the cause of the church. 
The eagle and the keys were displayed in their adverse banners; and 
the two factions of Italy most furiously raged when the origin and na- 
ture of the dispute were long since forgotten. 109 After the retreat of 
the popes to Avignon they disputed in arms the vacant republic; and 
the mischiefs of discord were perpetuated by the wretched compromise 
of electing each year two rival senators. By their private hostilities 
the city and country were desolated, and the fluctuating balance in- 
clined with their alternate success. But none of either family had 
fallen by the sword till the most renowned champion of the Ursini was 
surprised and slain by the younger Stephen Colonna. 110 His triumph 
is stained with the reproach of violating the truce; their defeat was 
basely avenged by the assassination, before the church door, of an inno- 
cent boy and his two servants. Yet the victorious Colonna, with an 
annual colleague, was declared senator of Rome during the term of five 
years. And the muse of Petrarch inspired a wish, a hope, a prediction, 
that the generous youth, the son of his venerable hero, would restore 
Rome and Italy to their pristine glory; that his justice would extirpate 
the wolves and lions, the serpents and bears, who laboured to subvert 
the eternal basis of the marble COLUMN. IU 

** In his fifty-first Dissertation on the Italian Antiquities Muratori explains 
the factions of the Guelphs and Ghibelines. 

Petrarch (torn. i. p. 222-230) has celebrated this victory according to 
the Colonna; but two contemporaries, a Florentine (Giovanni Villani 1. x. 
c. 220) and a Roman (Ludovico Monaldeschi, p. 533, 534), are less favourable 
to their arms. 

111 The Abbe de Sade (torn, i. Notes, p. 61-66) has applied the sixth Canzone 
of Petrarch, Spirto Gcntil, etc., to Stephen Colonna the younger:

IN the apprehension of modern times Petrarch 1 is the Italian songster 
of Laura and love. In the harmony of his Tuscan rhymes Italy ap- 
plauds, or rather adores, the father of her lyric poetry; and his verse, 
or at least his name, is repeated by the enthusiasm or affectation of 
amorous sensibility. Whatever may be the private taste of a stranger, 
his slight and superficial knowledge should humbly acquiesce in the 
taste of a learned nation; yet I may hope or presume that the Italians 
do not compare the tedious uniformity of sonnets and elegies with the 
sublime compositions of their epic muse, the original wildness of Dante, 
the regular beauties of Tasso, and the boundless variety of the incom- 
parable Ariosto. The merits of the lover I am still less qualified to 
appreciate: nor am I deeply interested in a metaphysical passion for 
a nymph so shadowy, that her existence has been questioned; 2 for a 
matron so prolific, 8 that she was delivered of eleven legitimate children, 4 
while her amorous swain sighed and sung at the fountain of Vaucluse. 5 
But in the eyes of Petrarch and those of his graver contemporaries his 
love was a sin, and Italian verse a frivolous amusement. His Latin 

x The Memoires sur la Vie de Francois Petrarque {Amsterdam, 1764, 1767, 
3 vols. in 4to) form a copious, original, and entertaining work, a labour of 
love, composed from the accurate study of Petrarch and his contemporaries; 
but the hero is too often lost in the general history of the age, and the author 
too often languishes in the affectation of politeness and gallantry. In the 
preface to his first volume he enumerates and weighs twenty Italian biog- 
raphers, who have professedly treated of the same subject 

The allegorical interpretation prevailed in the fifteenth century; hut the 
wise commentators were not agreed whether they should understand, by 

Laura, religion, or virtue, or the blessed Virgin, or . See the prefaces 

to the first and second volume. 

8 Laure de Noves, born about the year 1307, was married in January, 1325, 
to Hugues de Sade, a noble citizen of Avignon, whose jealousy was not the 
effect of love, since he married a second wife within seven months of her 
death, which happened the 6th of April, 1348, precisely one-and-twenty years 
after Petrarch had seen and loved her. 

* Corpus crebris partubus exhaustum: from one of these is issued, in the 
tenth degree, the abb6 de Sade, the fond and grateful biographer of Petrarch ; 
and this domestic motive most probably suggested the idea of his work, and 
urged him to inquire into every circumstance that could affect the history and 
character of his grandmother (see particularly torn. i. p. 122-133, notes, p 7-58; 
torn. ii. p. 455-495, not. p. 76-82).

works of philosophy, poetry, and eloquence established his serious repu- 
tation, which was soon diffused from Avignon over France and Italy: 
his friends and disciples were multiplied in every city; and if the pon- 
derous volume of his writings c be now abandoned to a long repose, our 
gratitude must applaud the man who, by precept and example, revived 
the spirit and study of the Augustan age. From his earliest youth Pe- 
trarch aspired to the poetic crown. The academical honours of the 
three faculties had introduced a royal degree of master or doctor in the 
art of poetry; 7 and the title of poet-laureat, which custom, rather than 
vanity, perpetuates in the English court, 8 was first invented by the 
Caesars of Germany, In the musical games of antiquity a prize was 
bestowed on the victor: the belief that Virgil and Horace had been 
crowned in the Capitol inflamed the emulation of a Latin bard; 10 and 
the laurel was endeared to the lover by a verbal resemblance with the 
name of his mistress. 11 The value of either object was enhanced by 
the difficulties of the pursuit; and if the virtue or prudence of Laura 
was inexorable, 13 he enjoyed, and might boast of enjoying, the nymph

the best time for abolishing this ridiculous custom is while the prince is a man 
of virtue, and the poet a man of genius.

the crown were given to superior merit, the exclusion of Statius, (Capitolia

Capitol; but the Latin poets who lived before Domitian were crowned only in 
the public opinion. '

the Capitoline, but the Delphic, crown (Plin. Hist. Natur. xv. 39; Hist. Critique

of poetry. His vanity was not of the most delicate kind, since he ap- 
plauds the success of his own labours; his name was popular; his friends 
were active; the open or secret opposition of envy and prejudice was 
surmounted by the dexterity of patient merit. In the thirty-sixth year 
of his age he was solicited to accept the object of his wishes; and on the 
same day, in the solitude of Vauduse, he received a similar and solemn 
invitation from the senate of Rome and the university of Paris. The 
learning of a theological school, and the ignorance of a lawless city, 
were alike unqualified to bestow the ideal though immortal wreath 
which genius may obtain from the free applause of the public and of 
posterity: but the candidate dismissed this troublesome reflection; 
and, after some moments of complacency and suspense, preferred the 
summons of the metropolis of the world. 

The ceremony of his coronation 1S was performed in the Capitol, by 
his friend and patron the supreme magistrate of the republic. Twelve 
patrician youths were arrayed in scarlet; six representatives of the most 
illustrious families, in green robes, with garlands of flowers, accom- 
panied the procession; in the midst of the princes and nobles, the sena- 
tor, count of Anguillara, a kinsman of the Colonna, assumed his throne; 
and at the voice of a herald Petrarch arose. After discoursing on a 
text of Virgil, and thrice repeating his vows for the prosperity of 
Rome, he knelt before the throne and received from the senator a laurel 
crown, with a more precious declaration, " This is the reward of merit." 
The people shouted, " Long life to the Capitol and the poet! " A son- 
net in praise of Rome was accepted as the effusion of genius and grati- 
tude; and after the whole procession had visited the Vatican the pro- 
fane wreath was suspended before the shrine of St. Peter. In the act 
or diploma " which was presented to Petrarch, the title and preroga- 
tives of poet-laureat are revived in the Capitol after the lapse of thir- 
teen hundred years; and he receives the perpetual privilege of wearing, 
at his choice, a crown of laurel, ivy, or myrtle, of assuming the poetic 
habit, and of teaching, disputing, interpreting, and composing, in, all 
places whatsoever, and on all subjects of literature. The grant was rati- 
fied by the authority of the senate and people; and the character of 
citizen was the recompense of his affection for the Roman name. They 
did him honour, but they did him justice. In the familiar society of 
Cicero and Livy he had imbibed the ideas of an ancient patriot; and 
his ardent fancy kindled every idea to a sentiment, and every sentiment 
to a passion. The aspect of the seven hills and their majestic ruins 
confirmed these lively impressions; and he loved a country by whose 
liberal spirit he had been crowned and adopted. The poverty and de-

basement of Rome excited the indignation and pity of her grateful 
son: he dissembled the faults of his fellow-citizens; applauded with par- 
tial fondness the last of their heroes and matrons; and in the remem- 
brance of the past, in the hope of the future, was pleased to forget the 
miseries of the present time. Rome was still the lawful mistress of the 
world; the pope and the emperor, her bishop and general, had abdi- 
cated their station by an inglorious retreat to the Rhone and the Dan- 
ube; but if she could resume her virtue, the republic might again vin- 
dicate her liberty and dominion. Amidst the indulgence of enthusiasm 
and eloquence," Petrarch, Italy, and Europe were astonished by a 
revolution which realised for a moment his most splendid visions. The 
rise and fall of the tribune Rienzi will occupy the following pages: 1 * 
the subject is interesting, the materials are rich, and the glance of a

the reader would open, by chance, either Petrarch or his French biographer. 
The latter has described the poet's first visit to Rome (torn. L p. 323-335). 
But, in the place of much idle rhetoric and morality, Petrarch might have 
amused the present and future age with an original account of the city and 
his coronation.

Rome, en 1347) was published at Paris, 1748, in I2mo. I am indebted to him 
for some facts and documents in John Hocsemius, canon of Liege, a contem- 
porary historian (Fabricius, Biblioth. Lat. med. ^Evi, torn. iii. p. 273; torn. iv.

" The abbe de Sade, who so freely expatiates on the history of the fourteenth 
century, might treat, as his proper subject, a revolution in which the heart oi 
Petrarch was so deeply engaged (Memoires, torn. ii. p. 50, 51, 320-417, notes, 
p, 70-76; torn. iii. p. 221-243, 366-375)- Not an idea or a fact in the writings ot 
Petrarch has probably escaped him.

* In his third volume of Italian Antiquities (p. 249-548) Muratori has 
inserted the Fragmenta Historic Romanse ab Anno 1327 usque ad Annum 1354, 
in the original dialect of Rome or Naples in the fourteenth century, and a Latin 
version for the benefit of strangers. It contains the most particular and au- 
thentic life of Cola (Nicholas) di Rienzi, which had been printed at Bracciano, 
1627, in 4to, under the name of Tomaso Fortifiocca, who is only mentioned in 
this work as having been punished by the tribune for forgery. Human nature 
is scarcely capable of such sublime or stupid impartiality; but whosoever is 
the author of these Fragments, he wrote on the spot and at the time, and 
paints, without design or art, the manners of Rome and the character of the 
tribune. 

"The first and splendid period of Rienzi, his tribunitian government, is 
contained in the eighteenth chapter of the Fragments (p. 399-479), which, in 
the new division, forms the second book of the history in thirty-eight smaller 
chapters or sections. 



8*6. THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

education, which they painfully bestowed, was the cause of his glory 
and untimely end. The study of history and eloquence, the writings of 
Cicero, Seneca, Livy, Caesar, and Valerius Maximus, elevated above his 
equals and contemporaries the genius of the young plebeian: he perused 
with indefatigable diligence the manuscripts and marbles of antiquity; 
loved to dispense his knowledge in familiar language, and was often 
provoked to exclaim, "Where are now these Romans? their virtue, 
their justice, their power? why was I not born in those happy times? " 21 
When the republic addressed to the throne of Avignon an embassy of 
the three orders, the spirit and eloquence of Rienzi recommended him 
to a. place among the thirteen deputies of the commons. The orator 
had the honour of haranguing Pope Clement the Sixth, and the satis- 
faction of conversing with Petrarch, a congenial mind; but his aspiring 
hopes were chilled by disgrace and poverty, and the patriot was reduced 
to a single garment and the charity of the hospital. From this misery 
he was relieved by the sense of merit or the smile of favour; and the 
employment of apostolic notary afforded him a daily stipend of five 
gold florins, a more honourable and extensive connection, and the right 
of contrasting, both in words and actions, his own integrity with the 
vices of the state. The eloquence of Rienzi was prompt and persua- 
sive: the multitude is always prone to envy and censure: he was stimu- 
lated by the loss of a brother and the impunity of the assassins; nor 
was it possible to excuse or exaggerate the public calamities. The 
blessings of peace and justice, for which civil society has been instituted, 
were banished from Rome: the jealous citizens, who might have endured 
every personal or pecuniary injury, were most deeply wounded in the 
dishonour of their wives and daughters; 22 they were equally oppressed 
by the arrogance of the nobles and the corruption of the magistrates; 
and the abuse of arms or of laws was the only circumstance that dis* 
tinguished the lions from the dogs and serpents of the Capitol. These 
allegorical emblems were variously repeated in the pictures which 
Rienzi exhibited in the streets and churches; and while the spectators 
gazed with curious wonder, the bold and ready orator unfolded the 
meaning, applied the satire, inflamed their passions, and announced a 
distant hope of comfort and deliverance. The privileges of Rome, her 
eternal sovereignty over her princes and provinces, was the theme of

his public and private discourse; and a monument of servitude became 
in his hands a title and incentive of liberty. The decree of the senate,, 
which granted the most ample prerogatives to the emperor Vespasian, 
had been inscribed on a copper-plate still extant in the choir of the 
church of St. John Lateran. 23 A numerous assembly of nobles and ple- 
beians was invited to this political lecture, and a convenient theatre was 
erected for their reception. The notary appeared in a magnificent and 
mysterious habit, explained the inscription by a version and commen- 
tary, 2 * and descanted with eloquence and zeal on the ancient glories of 
the senate and people, from whom all legal authority was derived. The 
supine ignorance of the nobles was incapable of discerning the serious 
tendency of such representations: they might sometimes chastise with 
words and blows the plebeian reformer; but he was often suffered in the 
Colonna palace to amuse the company with his threats and predictions; 
and the modern Brutus 2C was concealed under the mask of folly and 
the character of a buffoon. While they indulged their contempt, the 
restoration of the good estate, his favourite expression, was entertained 
among the people 33 a desirable, a possible, and at length as an ap- 
proaching, event; and while all had the disposition to applaud, some 
had the courage to assist, their promised deliverer. 

A prophecy, or rather a summons, affixed on the church door of St, 
George, was the first public evidence of his designs a nocturnal assem- 
bly of a hundred citizens on Mount Aventine, the first step to their 
execution. After an oath of secrecy and aid, he represented to the 
conspirators the importance and facility of their enterprise; that the 
nobles, without union or resources, were strong only in the fear of their 
imaginary strength; that all power, as well as right, was in the hands 
of the people; that the revenues of the apostolical chamber might re- 
lieve the public distress; and that the pope himself would approve their 
victory over the common enemies of government and freedom. After 
securing a faithful band to protect this first declaration, he proclaimed 
through the city, by sound of trumpet, that on the evening of the f d* 
lowing day all persons should assemble without arms before the church 
of St. Angelo, to provide for the re-establishment of the good estate. 
The whole night was employed in the celebration of thirty masses of the 
Holy Ghost; and in the morning Rienzi, bareheaded, but in complete 
armour, issued from the church, encompassed by the hundred con-

Lex regia empowers Vespasian to enlarge the Pomoerium, a^word familiar to- 
every antiquary. It was not so to the tribune ; he confounds it with pomdrium, 
an orchard, translates lo Jardino de Roma cioene Italia, and is copied by the 
less excusable ignorance of the Latin translator (p. 406) and the French his- 
torian (p. 33). Even the learning of Muratori has slumbered over the passage.

spirators. The pope's vicar, the simple bishop of Orvieto, who had 
been persuaded to sustain a part in this singular ceremony, marched on 
his right hand, and three great standards were borne aloft as the em- 
blems of their design. In the first, the banner of liberty, Rome was 
seated on two lions, with a palm in one hand and a globe in the other; 
St. Paul, with a drawn sword, was delineated in the banner of justice; 
and in the third, St. Peter held the keys of concord and peace. Rienzi 
was encouraged by the presence and applause of an innumerable crowd, 
who understood little and hoped much; and the procession slowly rolled 
forwards from the castle of St. Angelo to the Capitol. His triumph 
was disturbed by some secret emotions which he laboured to suppress: 
he ascended without opposition, and with seeming confidence, the cita- 
del of the republic; harangued the people from the balcony, and re- 
ceived the most flattering confirmation of his acts and laws. The 
nobles, as if destitute of arms and counsels, beheld in silent consterna- 
tion this strange revolution; and the moment had been prudently chosen 
when the most formidable, Stephen Colonna, was absent from the city. 
On the first rumour he returned to his palace, affected to despise this 
plebeian tumult, and declared to the messenger of Rienzi that at his 
leisure he would cast the madman from the windows of the Capitol. 
The great bell instantly rang an alarm, and so rapid was the tide, so 
urgent was the danger, that Colonna escaped with precipitation to the 
suburb of St. Laurence: from thence, after a moment's refreshment, he 
continued the same speedy career till he reached in safety his castle of 
Palestrina, lamenting his own imprudence, which had not trampled the 
spark of this mighty conflagration. A general and peremptory order 
was issued from the Capitol to all the nobles that they should peaceably 
retire to their estates: they obeyed, and their departure secured the 
tranquillity of the free and obedient citizens of Rome. 

But such voluntary obedience evaporates with the first transports of 
2eal; and Rienzi felt the importance of justifying his usurpation by a 
regular form and a legal title. At his own choice, the Roman people 
would have displayed their attachment and authority by lavishing on 
his head the names of senator or consul, of king or emperor: he pre- 
ferred the ancient and modest appellation of tribune; the protection 
of the commons was the. essence of that sacred office, and they were 
ignorant that it had never been invested with any share in the legisla- 
tive or executive powers of the republic. In this character, and with 
the consent of the Romans, the tribune enacted the most salutary laws 
for the restoration and maintenance of the good estate. By the first 
lie fulfils the wish of honesty and inexperience, that no civil suit should 
be protracted beyond the term of fifteen days. The danger of frequent 
perjury might justify the pronouncing against a false accuser the same 
penalty which his evidence would have inflicted: the disorders of the 
times might compel the legislator to punish every homicide with death 
and every injury with equal retaliation. But the execution of justice 
was hopeless till he had previously abolished the tyranny of the nobles. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 829 

It was formally provided that none, except the supreme magistrate, 
should possess or command the gates, bridges, or towers of the state; 
that no private garrisons should be introduced into the towns or castles 
of the Roman territory; that none should bear arms or presume to for- 
tify their houses in the city or country; that the barons should be re- 
sponsible for the safety of the highways and the free passage of pro- 
visions; and that the protection of malef actors and robbers should be 
expiated by a fine of a thousand marks of silver. But these regulations 
would have been impotent and nugatory, had not the licentious nobles 
been awed by the sword of the civil power. A sudden alarm from the 
bell of the Capitol could still summon to the standard above twenty 
thousand volunteers: the support of the tribune and the laws required 
a more regular and permanent force. In each harbour of the coast ^a 
vessel was stationed for the assurance of commerce: a standing militia 
of three hundred and sixty horse and thirteen hundred foot was levied, 
clothed, and paid in the thirteen quarters of the city; and the spirit of 
a commonwealth may be traced in the grateful allowance of one hun- 
dred florins, or pounds, to the heirs of every soldier who lost^his life in 
the service of his country. For the maintenance of the public defence, 
for the establishment of granaries, for the relief of widows, orphans, 
and indigent convents, Rienzi applied, without fear of sacrilege, the 
revenues of the apostolic chamber: the three branches of hearth-money, 
the salt-duty, and the customs were each of the} annual produce of one 
hundred thousand florins; 26 and scandalous were the abuses, if in four 
or five months the amount of the salt-duty could be trebled by his judi- 
cious economy. After thus restoring the forces and finances of the re- 
public, the tribune recalled the nobles from their solitary independence, 
required their personal appearance in the Capitol, and imposed an oath 
of allegiance to the new government, and of submission to the laws of 
the good estate. Apprehensive for their safety, but still more appre- 
hensive of the danger of a refusal, the princes and barons returned to 
their houses at Rome in the garb of simple and peaceful citizens; the 
Colonna and Ursini, the Savelli and Frangipani, were confounded before 
the tribunal of a plebeian, of the vile buffoon whom they had so often 
derided and their disgrace was aggravated by the indignation which 
they vainly struggled to disguise. The same o^th was successively pro- 
nounced by the several orders of society, the clergy and gentlemen, the 
judges and notaries, the merchants and artisans, and the gradual de- 
scent was marked by the increase of sincerity and zeal. They swore 
to live and die with the republic and the church, whose interest was 
artfully united by the nominal association of the bishop of Orvieto, the 
pope's vicar, to the office of tribune. It was the boast of Rienzi that

he had delivered the throne and patrimony of St. Peter from a rebelli- 
ous aristocracy; and Clement the Sixth, who rejoiced in its fall, affected 
to believe the professions, to applaud the merits, and to confirm the 
title of his trusty servant. The speech, perhaps the mind, of the tri- 
bune, was inspired with a lively regard for the purity of the faith: he 
insinuated his claim to a supernatural mission from the Holy Ghost; 
enforced by a heavy forfeiture the annual duty of confession and com- 
munion; and strictly guarded the spiritual as well as temporal welfare 
of his faithful people. 27 

Never perhaps has the energy and effect of a single mind been more 
remarkably felt than in the sudden, though transient, reformation of 
Rome by the tribune Rienzi. A den of robbers was converted to the 
discipline of a camp or convent: patient to hear, swift to redress, in- 
exorable to punish, his tribunal was always accessible to the poor and 
stranger; nor could birth, or dignity, or the immunities of the church, 
protect \the offender or his accomplices. The privileged houses, the 
private /sanctuaries in Rome, on which no officer of justice would pre- 
sume to trespass, were abolished; and he applied the timber and iron 
of their barricades in the fortifications of the Capitol. The venerable 
father of the Colonna was exposed in his own palace to the double 
shame of being desirous and of being unable to protect a criminal. A 
mule, with a jar of oil, had been stolen near Capranica; and the lord 
of the Ursini family was condemned to restore the damage and to dis- 
charge a fine of four hundred florins for his negligence in guarding the 
highways. Nor were the persons of the barons more inviolate than 
their lands or houses; and, either from accident or design, the same 
impartial rigour was exercised against the heads of the adverse factions. 
Peter Agapet Colonna, who had himself been senator of Rome, was 
arrested in the street for injury or debt; and justice was appeased by 
the tardy execution of Martin Ursini, who, among his various acts of 
violence and rapine, had pillaged a shipwrecked vessel at the mouth of 
the Tiber. 28 His name, the purple of two cardinals his uncles, a recent 
marriage, and a mortal disease, were disregarded by the inflexible trib- 
une, who had chosen his victim. The public officers dragged him from 
his palace and nuptial bed: his trial was short and satisfactory; the bell

voyage to the mouth of the Tiber, where they took shelter in a storm; but, 
instead of finding the current, unfortunately ran on a shoal: the vessel 
was stranded, the mariners escaped. 4. The cargo, which was pillaged, 
consisted of the revenue of Provence for the royal treasury, many bags of 
pepper and cinnamon, and bales of French cloth, to the value of 20,000 
florins: a rich prize. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 831 

of the Capitol convened the people: stripped of his mantle, on his 
knees, with his hands bound behind. his back, he heard the sentence of 
death, and, after a brief confession, Ursini was led away to the gallows. 
After such an example, none who were conscious of guilt could hope 
for impunity, and the flight of the wicked, -the licentious, and the idle, 
soon purified the city and territory of Rome. In this time (says the 
historian) the woods began to rejoice that they were no longer infested 
with robbers; the oxen began to plough; the pilgrims visited the sanctu- 
aries; the roads and inns were replenished with travellers; trade, plenty, 
and good faith were restored in the markets; and a purse of gold might 
be exposed without danger in the midst of the highway. As soon as 
the life and property of the subject are secure, the labours and rewards 
of industry spontaneously revive: Rome was still the metropolis of the 
Christian world, and the fame and fortunes of the tribune were dif- 
fused in every country by the strangers who had enjoyed the blessings 
of his government. 

The deliverance of his country inspired Rienzi with a vast and per- 
haps visionary idea of uniting Italy in a great federative republic, of 
which Rome should be the ancient and lawful head, and the free cities 
and princes the members and associates. His pen was not less eloquent 
than his tongue, and his numerous epistles were delivered to swift and 
trusty messengers. On foot, with a white wand in their hand, they 
traversed the forests and mountains; enjoyed, in the most hostile states t 
the sacred security of ambassadors; and reported, in the style of flak 
tery or truth, that the highways along their passage were lined with 
kneeling multitudes, who implored Heaven for the success of their un- 
dertaking. Could passion have listened to reason, could private inter- 
est have yielded to the public welfare, the supreme tribunal arid con- 
federate union of the Italian republic might have healed their intestine 
discord, and dosed the Alps against the barbarians of the North. But 
the propitious season had elapsed; .and if Venice, Florence, Sienna, 
Perugia, and many inferior cities, offered their lives and fortunes to the 
good estate, the tyrants of Lombardy and Tuscany must despise or hate 
the plebeian author of a free constitution. From them, however, and 
from every part of Italy, the tribune received the most friendly and re- 
spectful answers: they were followed by the ambassadors of the prince? 
and republics; and in this foreign conflux, on all the occasions of pleas- 
ure or business, the low-born notary could assume the familiar or 
majestic, courtesy of a sovereign. 20 The most glorious circumstance of 
his reign was an appeal .to his justice from Lewis king of Hungary, who 
complained that his brother and her husband had been perfidiously 

"It was thus that Oliver Cromwell's old acquaintance, who remembered 
his vulgar and ungracious entrance into the House of Commons, .were 
astonished at the ease and majesty of the Protector on his throne (see 
Harris's Life of Cromwell, p. 27-34, from Clarendon, Warwick, Whitelocke, 
Wajler, etc.). The consciousness of merit and power will sometimes elevate 
the manners to the station.

strangled by Jane queen of Naples: 30 her guilt or innocence was pleaded 
in a solemn trial at Rome; but after hearing the advocates, 31 the trib- 
une adjourned this weighty and invidious cause, which was soon de- 
termined by the sword of the Hungarian. Beyond the Alps, more espe- 
cially at Avignon, the revolution was the theme of curiosity, wonder, 
and applause. 32 Petrarch had been the private friend, perhaps the se- 
cret counsellor, of Rienzi: his writings breathe the most ardent spirit 
of patriotism and joy; and all respect for the pope, all gratitude for the 
Colonna, was lost in the superior duties of a Roman citizen. The poet- 
laureat of the Capitol maintains the act, applauds the hero, and min- 
gles with some apprehension and advice the most lofty hopes of the 
permanent and rising greatness of the republic. 33 

While Petrarch indulged these prophetic visions, the Roman hero was 
fast declining from the meridian of fame and power; and the people, 
who had gazed with astonishment on the ascending meteor, began to 
mark the irregularity of its course, and the vicissitudes of light and

a [In his letter to the archbishop of Prague, Rienzi thus describes the 
effect of his elevation on Italy and the world: "Did I not restore real 
peace among the cities that were distracted by factions; did I not cause all 
the citizens exiled by party violence, with their wretched wives and children, 
to be re-admitted? Had T nnt Kp&lt;nm to Avfinm-iicU +lt l/+isM*e n* mA ~r

Guelf and Ghibelline, for which countless thousands had perished, body and 
soul, under the eyes of their pastors, by the reduction of the city of Rome 
and all Italy into one amicable, peaceful, holy, and united confederacy? the 
consecrated standards and banners having been by me collected and blended 
together, and, in witness to our holy association and perfect union, offered 
up in the presence of the ambassadors of all the cities of Italy on the day 
of the assumption of our Blessed Lady." In the Libellus ad Csesarem he 
goes on to say: "I received the homage and submission of all the sovereigns 
of Apulia, the barons and counts, and almost all the people of Italy. I was 
honoured by solemn embassies and letters by the emperor of Constantinople 
and the king of England. The queen of Naples submitted herself and her 
kingdom to the protection of the tribune. The king of Hungary, by two 
solemn embassies, brought his cause against his queen and his nobles before 
y tribunal; and I venture to say further, that the fame of the tribune 
alarmed the soldan of Babylon. When the Christian pilgrims to the sepulchre 
of our Lord related to the Christian and Jewish inhabitants of Jerusalem all 
the yet unheard-of and wonderful circumstances of the reformation in Rome, 
both Jews and Christians celebrated the event with unusual festivities. When 
the soldan inquired the cause of these rejoicings, and received this intelligence 
about Rome, he ordered all the havens and cities on the coast to be fortified/ 1

obscurity. More eloquent than judicious, more enterprising than reso- 
lute, the faculties of Rienzi were not balanced by cool and commanding 
reason; he magnified in a tenfold proportion the objects of hope and 
fear; and prudence, which could not have erected, did not presume to 
fortify, his throne. In the blaze of prosperity, his virtues were insen- 
sibly tinctured with the adjacent vices; justice with cruelty, liberality 
with profusion, and the desire of fame with puerile and ostentatious 
vanity. He might have learned that the ancient tribunes, so strong and 
sacred in the public opinion, were not distinguished in style, habit, or 
appearance, from an ordinary plebeian; 34 and that, as often as they 
visited the city on foot, a single viator, or beadle, attended the exercise 
of their office. The Gracchi would have frowned or smiled, could they

TRIBUNE AUGUST: " his theatrical pageants had prepared the revolu- 
tion; but Rienzi abused, in luxury and pride, the political maxim of 
speaking to the eyes, as well as the understanding, of the multitude. 
From nature he had received the gift of a handsome person, 50 till it 
was swelled and disfigured by intemperance: and his propensity to 
laughter was corrected in the magistrate by the affectation of gravity 
and sternness- He was clothed, at least on public occasions, in a parti- 
coloured robe of velvet or satin, .lined with fur, and embroidered with 
gold: the rod of justice, which he carried in his hand, was a sceptre of 
polished steel, crowned with a globe and cross of gold, and enclosing a 
small fragment of the true and holy wood. In his civil and religious 
processions through the city, he rode on a white steed, the symbol of 
royalty: the great banner of the republic, a sun with a circle of stars, 
a dove with an olive-branch, was displayed over his head; a shower of 
gold and silver was scattered among the populace; fifty guards with 
halberds encompassed his person; a troop of horse preceded his march; 
and their tymbals and trumpets were of massy silver.

almost as a monster, Rienzi travea una ventresca tonna trionfalc, a modo dc

334 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

The ambition of the honours of chivalry ;l7 betrayed the meanness of 
his birth and degraded the importance of his office; and the equestrian 
tribune was not less odious to the nobles, whom he adopted, than to 
the plebeians, whom he deserted. All that yet remained of treasure, or 
luxury, or art, was exhausted on that solemn day. Rienzi led the pro- 
cession from the Capitol to the Lateran; the tediousness of the way 
was relieved with decorations and games; the ecclesiastical, civil, and 
military orders marched under their various banners; the Roman ladies 
attended his wife; and the ambassadors of Italy might loudly applaud 
or secretly deride the novelty of the pomp. In the evening, when they 
had reached the church and palace of Constantine, he thanked and dis- 
missed the numerous assembly, with an invitation to the festival of the 
ensuing day. From the hands of a venerable knight he received the 
order of the Holy Ghost; the purification of the bath was a previous 
ceremony; but in no step of his life did Rienzi excite such scandal and 
censure as by the profane use of the porphyry vase in which Constan- 
tine (a foolish legend) had been healed of his leprosy by Pope Sylves- 
ter. 38 With equal presumption the tribune watched or reposed within 
the consecrated precincts of the baptistery; and the failure of his state- 
bed was interpreted as an omen of his approaching downfall. At the 
hour of worship he showed himself to the returning crowds in a majes- 
tic attitude, with a robe of purple, his sword, and gilt spurs; but" the 
, holy rites were soon interrupted by his levity and insolence. Rising 
from his throne, and advancing towards the congregation, he proclaimed 
hi a loud voice, " We summon to our tribunal Pope Clement, and com- 
mand him to reside in his diocese of Rome: we also summon the sacred 
college of cardinals. 30 We again summon the two pretenders, Charles 
of Bohemia and Lewis of Bavaria, who style themselves emperors: we 
likewise summon all the electors of Germany to inform us on what pre- 
tence they have usurped the inalienable right of the Roman people, the 

"Strange as it may seem, this festival was not without a precedent. In 
the year 1327, two barons, a Colonna and an Ursini, the usual balance, 
were created knights by the Roman people: their bath was of rose-water, 
their beds were decked with royal magnificence, and they were served at 
St Maria of Araceli in the Capitol' by the twenty-eight buoni huomim. 
They afterwards received from Robert king of Naples the sword of chivalry 
(Hist. Rom. 1. i. c. 2. p. 259). 

[Rienzi, on July 26, 1347, issued his famous edict affirming the sacred 
majesty and supremacy of the Roman people, and declaring all the privileges 
assumed by 'the popes to be forfeited. This edict, after being submitted to 
a committee of jurists, was issued in the name of the Italian nation. -0. S.] 

.All parties believed in the leprosy and bath of Constantine (Petrarch, 
Epist. Famil. vi. 2), and Rienzi justified his own conduct by observing to 
the court of Avignon, that a vase which had been used by a pagan could 
not be profaned by a pious Christian. Yet this crime is specified in the 

*nJ. ex comr nunication (Hocsemius, apud du Cergeau, p. 180, 190). 

This verbal summons of Pope Clement VI., which rests on the authority 
of the Roman historian and a Vatican MS., is disputed by the biographer 
of Petrarch (torn. ii. not. p. 70-76) with arguments rather of decency than 
ol weight. The court of Avignon might not choose to agitate this delicate 
question.

ancient and lawful sovereigns of the empire." 40 Unsheathing his 
maiden sword, he thrice brandished it to the three parts of the world, 
and thrice repeated the extravagant declaration, " And this too is 
mine! " The pope's vicar, the bishop of Orvieto, attempted to check 
this career of folly; but his feeble protest was silenced by martial 
music; and instead of withdrawing from the assembly, he consented to 
dine with his brother tribune at a table which had hitherto been re- 
served for the supreme pontiff. A banquet, such as the Caesars had 
given, was prepared for the Romans. The apartments, porticoes, and 
courts of the Lateran were spread with innumerable tables for either 
sex and every condition; a stream of wine flowed from the nostrils of 
Constantine's brazen horse; no complaint, except of the scarcity of 
water, could be heard; and the licentiousness of the multitude was 
curbed by discipline and fear. A subsequent day was appointed for the 
coronation of Rienzi;* 1 seven crowns of different leaves or metals were 
successively placed on his head by the most eminent of the Roman 
clergy; they represented the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost; and he still 
professed to imitate the example of the ancient tribunes. These extra- 
ordinary spectacles might deceive or flatter the people; and their own 
vanity was gratified in the vanity of their leader. But in his private 
life he soon deviated from the strict rule of frugality and abstinence; 
and the plebeians, who were awed by the splendour of the nobles, were 
provoked by the luxury of their equal. His wife, his son, his uncle (a 
barber in name and profession), exposed the contrast of vulgar man- 
ners and princely expense; and without acquiring the majesty, Rienzi 
degenerated into the vices, of a king, 

A simple citizen describes With pity, or perhaps with pleasure, the 
humiliation of the barons of Rome. " Bareheaded, their hands crossed 
on their breast, they stood with downcast looks in the presence of the 
tribune; and they trembled, good God, how *hey trembled! "* 2 As

folly, is extant in Hocsemius (Cergeau, p. 163-166). *_,., 

* l lt is singular that the Roman historian should have overlooked this 
sevenfold coronation, which is sufficiently proved by internal evidence, and 
the testimony of Hocsemius, and even of Rienzi (Cerceau, p. 107-170, 229). 

[It was on the occasion of his coronation that he made the impious 
comparison between 1 himself and our Lord. In the midst of all the wild 
and joyous exultation of the people, one of his most zealous supporters, a 
monk, who was in high repute for his sanctity, stood apart m a corner of 
the cnurch and wept bitterly. A domestic chaplain of Rienzi s inquired 
the cause of his grief. "Now," replied the man of God, "is thy ntester 
cast down from heaven; never saw I man so proud. By the aid &lt;3f the 
Holy Ghost he has driven the tyrants from the city without drawing &amp; 
sword: the citizens and the sovereigns of Italy have submitted to his power.

36 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

long as the yoke of Rienzi was that of justice and their country, their 
conscience forced them to esteem the man whom pride and interest 
provoked them to hate: his extravagant conduct soon fortified their 
hatred by contempt; and they conceived the hope of subverting a power 
which was no longer so deeply rooted in the public confidence. The 
old animosity of the Colonna and Ursini was suspended for a moment 
by their common disgrace: they associated their wishes, and perhaps 
their designs; an assassin was seized and tortured; he accused the 
nobles; and as soon as Rienzi deserved the fate, he adopted the sus- 
picions and maxims, of a tyrant. On the same day, under various pre- 
tences, he invited to the Capitol his principal enemies, among whom 
were five members of the Ursini and three of the Colonna name. But 
instead of a council or a banquet, they found themselves prisoners 
under the sword of despotism or justice; and the consciousness of inno- 
cence or guilt might inspire them with equal apprehensions of danger. 
At the sound of the great bell the people assembled; they were ar- 
raigned for a conspiracy against the tribune's life; and though some 
might sympathise in their distress, not a hand nor a voice was raised to 
rescue the first of the nobility from their impending doom. Their ap- 
parent boldness was prompted by despair; they passed in separate 
chambers a sleepless and painful night; and the venerable hero, Stephen 
Colonna, striking against the door of his prison, repeatedly urged his 
guards to deliver him by a speedy death from such ignominious servi- 
tude. In the morning they understood their sentence from the visit of a 
confessor and the tolling of the bell. The great hall of the Capitol had 
been decorated for the bloody scene with red and white hangings: the 
countenance of the tribune was dark and severe; the swords of the exe- 
cutioners were unsheathed; and the barons were interrupted in their 
dying speeches by the sound of trumpets. But in this decisive moment 
Rienzi was not less anxious or apprehensive than his captives: he 
dreaded the splendour of their names,, their surviving kinsmen, the in- 
constancy of the people, the reproaches of the world; and, after rashly 
offering a mortal injury, he vainly presumed that, if he could forgive, 
he might himself be forgiven. His elaborate oration was that of a 
Christian and a suppliant; and, as the humble minister of the com- 
mons, he entreated his masters to pardon these noble criminals, for 
whose repentance and future service he pledged his faith and authority. 
" If you are spared," said the tribune, " by the mercy of the Romans, 
will you not promise to support the good estate with your lives and for- 
tunes? " Astonished by this marvellous clemency, the barons bowed 
their heads; and while they devoutly repeated the oath of allegiance, 
might whisper a secret, and more sincere, assurance of revenge. A 
priest, in the name of the people, pronounced their absolution; they 
received the communion with the tribune, assisted at the banquet, fol- 
lowed the procession; and, after every spiritual and temporal sign of 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 837 

reconciliation, were dismissed in safety to their respective homes, witL 
the new honours and titles of generals, consuls, and patricians.* 3 

During some weeks they were checked by the memory of their dan- 
ger, rather than of their deliverance, till the most powerful of the Ur- 
sini, escaping with the Colonna from the city, erected at Marino the 
standard of rebellion. The fortifications of the castle were hastily re- 
stored; the vassals attended their lord; the outlaws armed against the 
magistrate; the flocks and herds, the harvests and vineyards from Ma- 
rino to the gates of Rome, were swept away or destroyed; and the peo- 
ple arraigned Rienzi as the author of the calamities which his govern- 
ment had taught them to forget. In the camp Rienzi appeared to less 
advantage than in the rostrum; and he neglected the progress of the 
rebel barons till their numbers were strong, and their castles impreg- 
nable. From the pages of Livy he had not imbibed the art, or even 
the courage, of a general: an army of twenty thousand Romans re- 
turned without honour or effect from the attack of Marino; and his 
vengeance was amused by painting his enemies, their heads downwards, 
and drowning two dogs (at least they should have been bears) as the 
representatives of the Ursini. The belief of his incapacity encouraged 
their operations: they were invited by their secret adherents; and the 
barons attempted, with four thousand foot and sixteen hundred horse, 
to enter Rome by force or surprise. The city was prepared for their 
reception; the alarm-bell rung all night; the gates were strictly guarded, 
or insolently open; and after some hesitation they sounded a retreat. 
The two first divisions had passed along the walls, but the prospect of 
a free entrance tempted the headstrong valour of the nobles in the rear; 
and after a successful skirmish, they were overthrown and massacred 
without quarter by the crowds of the Roman people. Stephen Colonna 
the younger, the noble spirit to whom Petrarch ascribed the restoration 
of Italy, was preceded or accompanied in death by his son John, a 
gallant youth, by his brother Peter, who might regret the ease and hon- 
ours of the church, by a nephew of legitimate birth, and by two bas- 
tards of the Colonna race; and the number of seven, the seven crowns, 
as Rienzi styled them, of the Holy Ghost, was completed by the agony 
of the deplorable parent, of the veteran chief, who had survived the 
hope and fortune of his house. The vision and prophecies of St. Mar- 
tin and Pope Boniface had been used by the tribune to animate his 
troops: 44 he displayed, at least in the pursuit, the spirit of a hero; but 
he forgot the maxims of the ancient Romans, who abhorred the tri- 

**The original letter, in which Rienzi justifies his treatment of the Colonna 
(Hocsemius, apud Du Cerceau, p. 222-229), displays, in genuine colours, 
the mixture of the knave and the madman. 

44 Rienzi, in the above-mentioned letter, ascribes to St Martin the tribune, 
Boniface VIII. the enemy of Colonna, himself, and the Roman people, 
the glory of the day, which Villani likewise (1. xii. c, 104) describes as a 
regular battle. The disorderly skirmish, the flight of the Romans, and the 
cowardice of Rienzi, are painted in the simple and minute narrative of 
Fortifiocca, or the anonymous citizen (1. il c. 34-37)- 



838 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

umphs of civil war. The conqueror ascended the Capitol; deposited 
his crown and sceptre on the altar; and boasted, with some truth, that 
he had cut off an ear which neither pope nor emperor had been able 
to amputate. 45 His base and implacable revenge denied the honours 
of burial; and the bodies of the Colonna, which he threatened to expose 
with those of the vilest malefactors, were secretly interred by the holy 
virgins of their name and family. 46 The people sympathised in their 
grief, repented of their own fury, and detested the indecent joy of 
Rienzi, who visited the spot where these illustrious victims had fallen. 
It was on that fatal spot that he conferred on his son the honour of 
knighthood: and the ceremony was accomplished by a slight blow from 
each of the horsemen of the guard, and by a ridiculous and inhuman 
ablution from a pool of water, which was yet polluted with patrician 
blood. 47 

A short delay would have saved the Colonna, the delay of a single 
month, which elapsed between the triumph and the exile of Rienzi. In 
the pride of victory he forfeited what yet remained of his civil Virtues, 
without acquiring the fame of military prowess. A free and vigorous 
opposition was formed in the city; and when the tribune proposed in 
the public council 4S to impose a new tax, and to regulate the govern- 
ment of Perugia, thirty-nine members voted against his measures, re- 
pelled the injurious charge of treachery and corruption, and urged him 
to prove, by their forcible exclusion, that, if the populace adhered to 
.his cause, it was already disclaimed by the most respectable citizens. 
The pope and the sacred college had never been dazzled by his specious 
professions; they were justly offended by the insolence of his conduct; 
a cardinal legate was sent to Italy, and after some fruitless treaty, and 
two personal interviews, he fulminated a bull of excommunication, in 
which the tribune is degraded from his office, and branded with the

*The convent of St. Silvester was founded, endowed, and protected by 
the Colonna cardinals, for the daughters of the family who embraced a 
monastic life, and who, in, the year 1318, were twelve in number. The 
others were allowed to marry with their kinsmen in the fourth degree, and 
the dispensation was justified by the small number and close alliances of 
the noble families of Rome (Me*moires sur Petrarque, torn. i. p. no, torn. ii. 
p. 401).

guilt of rebellion, sacrilege, and heresy. 40 The surviving barons of 
Rome were now humbled to a sense of allegiance; their interest and 
revenge engaged them in the service of the church; but as the fate of 
the Colonna was before their eyes, they abandoned to a private ad- 
venturer the peril and glory of the revolution. John Pepin, count of 
Minorbino, in the kingdom of Naples, had been condemned for his 
crimes, or his riches, to perpetual imprisonment; and Petrarch, by so- 
liciting his release, indirectly contributed to the ruin of his friend. At 
the head of one hundred and fifty soldiers the count of Minorbino in- 
troduced himself into Rome, barricaded the quarter of the Colonna, 
and found the enterprise as easy as it had seemed impossible. From 
the first alarm the bell of the Capitol incessantly tolled; but instead of 
repairing to the well-known sound, the people were silent and inactive; 
and the pusillanimous Rienzi, deploring their ingratitude with sighs and 
tears, abdicated the government and palace of the republic. 

Without drawing his sword, Count Pepin restored the aristocracy and 
the church; three senators were chosen, and the legate, assuming the 
first rank, accepted his two colleagues from the rival families of Co- 
lonna' and UVsini. The acts of the tribune were abolished, his head 
was proscribed; yet such was the terror of his name, that the barons 
hesitated three days before they would trust themselves in the city, 
and Rienzi was left above a month in the castle of St. Angelo, from 
whence he peaceably withdrew, after labouring, without effect, to re- 
vive the affection and courage of the Romans. The vision of freedom 
and empire had vanished: their fallen spirit would have acquiesced in 
servitude, had it been smoothed by tranquillity and order; and it was 
scarcely observed that the new senators derived their authority from 
the Apostolic See, that four cardinals were appointed to reform, with 
dictatorial power, the state of the republic. Rome was again agitated 
by the bloody feuds of the barons, who detested each other and de- 
spised the commons: their hostile fortresses, both in, town and country, 
again rose, and were again demolished: and the peaceful citizens, a 
flock of sheep, were devoured, says the Florentine historian, by these 
rapacious wolves. But when. their pride and avarice had exhausted this 
patience of the Romans, a confraternity of the Virgin Mary protected 
or avenged the republic: the bell of the Capitol was again tolled, the 
nobles in arms trembled in the presence of an unarmed multitude; and 
of the two senators, Colonna escaped from the window of the palace, 
and Ur&amp;ini was stoned at the foot of the altar. The dangerous office

of tribune was successively occupied by two plebeians, Cerroni and 
Baroncelli. The mildness of Cerroni was unequal to the times, and 
after a faint struggle he retired with a fair reputation and a decent 
fortune to the comforts of rural life. Devoid of eloquence or genius, 
Baroncelli was distinguished by a resolute spirit: he spoke the language 
of a patriot, and trod in the footsteps of tyrants; his suspicion was a 
sentence of death, and his own death was the reward of his cruelties. 
Amidst the public misfortunes the faults of Rienzi were forgotten, and 
the Romans sighed for the peace and prosperity of the good estate. 61 
After an exile of seven years, the first deliverer was again restored 
to his country. In the disguise of a monk or a pilgrim he escaped from 
the castle of St. Angelo, implored the friendship of the king of Hungary 
at Naples, tempted the ambition of every bold adventurer, mingled 
at Rome with the pilgrims of the jubilee, lay concealed among the her- 
mits of the Apennine, and wandered through the cities of Italy, Ger- 
many, and Bohemia. His person was invisible, his name was yet for- 
midable; and the anxiety of the court of Avignon supposes, and even 
magnifies, his personal merit. The emperor Charles the Fourth gave 
audience to a stranger, who frankly revealed himself as the tribune of 
the republic, and astonished an assembly of ambassadors and princes 
by the eloquence of a patriot and the visions of a prophet, the down- 
fall of tyranny and the kingdom of the Holy Ghost. Ba Whatever had 
been his hopes, Rienzi found himself a captive; but he supported a 
character of independence and dignity, and obeyed, as his own choice, 
the irresistible summons of the supreme pontiff. The zeal of Petrarch, 
which had been cooled by the unworthy conduct, was rekindled by the 
sufferings and the presence of his friend; and he boldly complains of 
the times in which the saviour of Rome was delivered by her emperor 

Bl The troubles of Rome, from the departure to the return of Rienzi, are 
related by Matteo Villani (1. ii. c. 47, 1. iii. c. 33, 57, 78) and Thomas Forti- 
fiocca (1. iii. c. 1-4). I have slightly passed over these secondary characters, 
who imitated the original tribune. 

"These visions, of which the friends and enemies of Rienzi seem alike 
ignorant, are surely magnified by the zeal of Pollistore, a Dominican in- 
quisitor (Rer. Ital. torn. xxv. c. 36, p. 819). Had the tribune taught that 
Christ was succeeded by the Holy Ghost, that the tyranny of the pope 
would be abolished, he might have been convicted of heresy and treason, 
without offending the Roman people. 

[So far from having magnified these visions, Pollistore is more than con- 
firmed by the^ documents published by Papencordt. t The adoption of all 
the wild doctrines of the Fratricelli, the Spirituals, in which, for the time 
at least, Rienzi appears to have been in earnest, his magnificent offers to 
the 1 emperor, and the whole history of his life, from his first escape from 
Rome to his imprisonment at Avignon, are among the most curious chapters 
of his eventful life. The letters of Rienzi, as given in Papencordt's work, 
portray the state of Rome, indict the pope, and are thoroughly Ghibelline 
in spirit, expressing the need of keeping the secular and ecclesiastical powers 
apart. Gregorovius says, " The tribune in chains at Prague was more danger- 
ous to the papacy than he had been when at the height of his power in 
the Capitol. He now expressed the necessity for mankind of a reformation ; 
and this it is which secures him a place in history."- 0. S.] 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 841 

into the hands of her bishop. Rienzi was transported slowly but in 
safe custody from Prague to Avignon: his entrance into the city was 
that of a malefactor; in his prison he was chained by the leg, and four 
cardinals were named to inquire into the crimes of heresy and rebellion. 
But his trial and condemnation would have involved some questions 
which it was more prudent to leave under the veil of mystery: the tem- 
poral supremacy of the popes, the duty of residence, the civil and 
ecclesiastical privileges of the clergy and people of Rome. The reign- 
ing pontiff well deserved the appellation of Clement: the strange vicissi- 
tudes and magnanimous spirit of the captive excited his pity and es- 
teem; and Petrarch believes that he respected in the hero the name and 
sacred character of a poet. 63 Rienzi was indulged with an easy con- 
finement and the use of books; and in the assiduous study of Livy and 
the Bible he sought the cause and the consolation of his misfortunes. 
The succeeding pontificate of Innocent the Sixth opened a new pros- 
pect of his deliverance and restoration; and the court of Avignon was 
persuaded that the successful rebel could alone appease and reform 
the anarchy of the metropolis. After a solemn profession of fidelity, 
the Roman tribune was sent into Italy with the title of senator; but the 
death of Baroncelli appeared to supersede the use of his mission; and 
the legate, Cardinal Albornoz, 54 a consummate statesman, allowed him 
with reluctance, and without aid, to undertake the perilous experiment. 
His first reception was equal to his wishes: the day of his entrance was 
a public festival, and his eloquence and authority revived the laws of 
the good estate. But this momentary sunshine was soon clouded by 
his own vices and those of the people: in the Capitol he might often 
regret the prison of Avignon; and after a second administration of four 
months Rienzi was massacred in a tumult which had been fomented by 
the Roman barons. In the society of the Germans and Bohemians he 
is said to have contracted the habits of intemperance and cruelty: ad- 
versity had chilled his enthusiasm without fortifying his reason or vir- 
tue; and that youthful hope, that lively assurance, which is the pledge 
of success, was now succeeded by the cold impotence of distrust and 
despair. The tribune had reigned with absolute dominion, by the 
choice, and in the hearts, of the Romans; the senator was the servile 
minister of a foreign court; and while he was suspected by the people, 
he was abandoned by the prince. The legate Albornoz, who seemed 
desirous of his ruin, inflexibly refused all supplies of men and money: 

"The astonishment, the envy almost, of Petrarch, is a proof, if not of 
the truth of this incredible fact, at least of hi s&lt; own veracity. The abbe de 
Sade (Memoires, torn. iii. p. 242) quotes the sixth epistle of the thirteenth 
book of Petrarch, but it is of the royal MS. which he consulted, and not of 
the ordinary Basil edition (p. 920).

and cardinal legate in Italy (A.D. 1353-1367), restored, by his arms and 
counsels, the temporal dominion of the popes. His life has been separate^

842 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

a faithful subject could no longer presume to touch the revenues of the 
apostolical chamber; and the first idea of a tax was the signal of 
clamour and sedition. Even his justice was tainted with the guilt or 
reproach of selfish cruelty: the most virtuous citizen of Rome was sacri- 
ficed to his jealousy; and in the execution of a public robber, from 
whose purse he had been assisted, the magistrate too much forgot, or 
too much remembered, the obligations of the debtor. 60 A civil war ex- 
hausted his treasures and the patience of the city: the Colonna main- 
tained their hostile station at Palestrina; and his mercenaries soon de- 
spised a leader whose ignorance and fear were envious of all subordinate 
merit. In the death, as in the life, of Rienzi, the hero and the coward 
were strangely mingled. When the Capitol was invested by a furious 
multitude, when he was basely deserted by his civil and military ser- 
vants, the intrepid senator, waving the banner of liberty, presented 
himself on the balcony, addressed his eloquence to the various passions 
of the Romans, and laboured to persuade them that in the same cause 
himself and the republic must either stand or falL His oration was in- 
terrupted by a volley of imprecations and stones; and after an arrow 
bad transpierced his hand, he sunk into abject despair, and fled weeping 
to the inner chambers, from whence he was let down by a sheet before 
the windows of the prison. Destitute of aid or hope, he was besieged 
till the evening; the doors of the Capitol were destroyed with axes and 
fire; and while the senator attempted to escape in a plebeian habit, he 
was discovered and dragged to the platform of the palace, the fatal scene 
of his judgments and executions. A whole hour, without voice or mo- 
tion, he stood amidst the multitude half naked and half dead: their 
rage was hushed into curiosity and wonder: the last feelings of rever- 
ence and compassion yet struggled in his favour; and they might have 
prevailed, if a bold assassin had not plunged a dagger in his breast. 
He fell senseless with the first stroke; the impotent revenge of his ene- 
mies inflicted a thousand wounds; and the senator's body was aban- 
doned to the dogs, to the Jews, and to the flames. Posterity will com- 
pare the virtues and failings of this extraordinary man; but in a long 
period of anarchy and servitude, the name of Rienri has often been 
celebrated as the deliverer of his country, and the last of the Roman 
patriots. 56 

The first and most generous wish of Petrarch was the restoration oi 
a free republic; but after the exile and death of his plebeian hero, he 
turned his eyes from the tribune to the king of the Romans. The Capi- 

85 From Matteo Villani and Fortifiocca, the P. du Cerqeau (p. 344-394} 
has extracted the life and death of the Chevalier Montreal, the life of a 
robber and the death of a hero. At the head of a free company, the first 
that desolated Italy, he became rich and formidable: he had money itt all 
the banks 60,060 ducats in Padua alone. 

M The exile, second government, and death of Rienzi, are minutely related 
by the anonymous Roman, who appears neither his friend nor his enemy

fate of the senator. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 843 

tol was yet stained with the blood of Rienzi when Charles the Fourth 
descended from the Alps to obtain the Italian and Imperial crowns. In 
his passage through Milan he received the visit, and repaid the flat- 
tery, of the poet laureat; accepted a medal of Augustus; and promised, 
without a smile, to imitate the founder of the Roman monarchy. A 
false application of the names and maxims of antiquity was the source 
of the hopes and disappointments of Petrarch; yet he could not over- 
look the difference of times and characters; the immeasurable distance 
between the first Caesars and a Bohemian prince, who by the favour 
of the clergy had been elected the titular head of the German aristoc- 
racy. Instead of restoring to Rome her glory and her provinces, he 
had bound himself by a secret treaty with the pope to evacuate the 
city on the day of his coronation; and his shameful retreat was pursued 
by the reproaches of the patriot bard. 57 

After the loss of liberty and empire, his third and more humble wish 
was to reconcile the shepherd with his flock; to recall the Roman bishop 
to his ancient and peculiar diocese. In the fervour of youth, with the 
authority of age, Petrarch addressed his exhortations to five successive 
popes, and his eloquence was always inspired by the enthusiasm of 
sentiment and the freedom of language. 68 The son of a citizen of Flor- 
ence invariably preferred the country of his birth to that of his educa- 
tion; and Italy, in his eyes, was the queen and garden of the world. 
Amidst her domestic factions she was doubtless superior to France both 
in art and science, in wealth and politeness; but the difference could 
scarcely support the epithet of barbarous, which he promiscuously be- 
stows on the countries beyond the Alps. Avignon, the mystic Babylon,, 
the sink of vice and corruption, was the object of his hatred and con- 
tempt; but he forgets that her scandalous vices were not the growth 
of the soil, and that in every residence they would adhere to. the power 
and luxury of the papal court. He confesses that the successor of St. 
Peter is the bishop of the universal church; yet it was not on the banks 
Of the Rh8ne, but of the Tiber, that the apostle had fixed his everlast- 
ing throne: and while every city in the Christian world was blessed 
with a bishop, the metropolis alone was desolate and forlorn. Since the 
removal of the Holy See the sacred buildings of the Lateran and the 
Vatican, their altars and their saints, were left in a state of poverty and 
decay; and Rome was often painted under the image of a disconsolate 
matron, as if the wandering husband could be reclaimed by the homely

portrait of the age and infirmities of his weeping spouse. 59 But the 
doud which hung over the seven hills would be dispelled by the pres- 
ence of their lawful sovereign: eternal fame, the prosperity of Rome, 
and the peace of Italy, would be the recompense of the pope who should 
dare to embrace this generous resolution. Of the five whom Petrarch 
exhorted, the three first, John the Twenty-second, Benedict the Twelfth, 
and Clement the Sixth, were importuned or amused by the boldness of 
the orator; but the memorable change which had been attempted by 
Urban the Fifth was finally accomplished by Gregory the Eleventh. 
The execution of their design was opposed by weighty and almost in- 
superable obstacles. A king of France, who has deserved the epithet 
of wise, was unwilling to release them from a local dependence: the 
cardinals, for the most part his subjects, were attached to the language, 
manners, and climate pf Avignon; to their stately palaces; above all, 
to the wines of Burgundy. In their eyes Italy was foreign or hostile; 
and they reluctantly embarked at Marseilles, as if they had been sold 
or banished into the land of the Saracens. Urban the Fifth resided 
three years in the Vatican with safety and honour; his sanctity was 
protected by a guard of two thousand horse; and the king of Cyprus, 
the queen of Naples, and the emperors of the East and West, devoutly 
saluted their common father in the chair of St. Peter. But the joy of 
Petrarch and the Italians was soon turned into grief and indignation. 
Some reasons of public or private moment, his own impatience or the 
prayers of the cardinals, recalled Urban to France; and the approach- 
ing election was saved from the tyrannic patriotism of the Romans. 
The powers of heaven were interested in their cause: Bridget of Swe- 
den, a saint and pilgrim, disapproved the return, and foretold the death, 
of Urban the Fifth; the migration of Gregory the Eleventh was en- 
couraged by St. Catherine of Sienna, the spouse of Christ and ambassa- 
dress of the Florentines; and the popes themselves, the great masters 
of human credulity, appear to have listened to these visionary females. 00 
Yet those celestial admonitions were supported by some arguments of 
temporal policy. The residence of Avignon had been invaded by hos- 
tile violence: at the head of thirty thousand robbers a hero had ex- 
torted ransom and absolution from the vicar of Christ and the sacred

Urban V. in prose are more simple and persuasive (Senilium, 1. vii. p. 811-827; 
1 ix. epist. i. p. 844-854). 

*I have not leisure to expatiate on the legends of St. Bridget or St 
Catherine, the last of which might furnish some amusing stories. Their 
effect on the mind of Gregory XL is attested by the last solemn words of 
the dying pope, who admonished the assistants, ut caverant ab hominibus, 
sive viris, sive mulieribus, sub specie religionis loquentibus visiones sui 
ca$itis,.quia per tales ipse seductus, etc. (Baluz. Not. ad Vit. Pap. Avenio-

college; and the maxim of the French warriors, to spare the people and 
plunder the church, was a new heresy of the most dangerous import." 
While the pope was driven from Avignon, he was strenuously invited 
to Rome. The senate and people acknowledged him as their lawful 
sovereign, and laid at his feet the keys of the gates, the bridges, and 
the fortresses; 02 of the quarter at least beyond the Tiber. But this 
loyal offer was accompanied by a declaration that they could no longer 
suffer the scandal and calamity of his absence; and that his obstinacy 
would finally provoke them to revive and assert the primitive right of 
election. The abbot of Mount Cassin had been consulted whether he 
would accept the triple crown 3 from the clergy and people: " I am a 
citizen of Rome," 4 replied that venerable ecclesiastic, " and my first 
law is the voice of my country." 65 

If superstition will interpret an untimely death; 66 if the merit of 
counsels be judged from the event; the heavens may seem to frown 
on a measure of such apparent reason and propriety. Gregory tha 
Eleventh did not survive above fourteen months his return to the Vati- 
can; and his decease was followed by the great schism of the West, 
which distracted the Latin church above forty years. The sacred col- 
lege was then composed of twenty-two cardinals: six of these had re- 
mained at Avignon; eleven Frenchmen, one Spaniard, and four Italians,

of Avignon had been molested by similar freebooters, who afterwards 
passed the Alps (Memoires sur P&amp;rarque, torn. iii. p. 563-569). '\

entered the conclave in the usual form. Their choice was not yet lim- 
ited to the purple; and their unanimous votes acquiesced in the arch- 
bishop of Bari, a subject of Naples, conspicuous for his zeal and learn- 
ing, who ascended the throne of St. Peter under the name of Urban the 
Sixth. The epistle of the sacred college affirms his free and regular 
election, which had been inspired as usual by the Holy Ghost; he was 
adored, invested, and crowned, with the customary rites; his temporal 
authority was obeyed at Rome and Avignon, and his ecclesiastical su- 
premacy was acknowledged in the Latin world. During several weeks 
the cardinals attended their new master with the fairest professions of 
attachment and loyalty, till the summer heats permitted a decent escape 
from the city. But as soon as they were united at Anagni and Fundi, 
in a place of security, they cast aside the mask, accused their own 
falsehood and hypocrisy, excommunicated the apostate the antichrist 
of Rome, and proceeded to a new election of Robert of Geneva, Clem- 
oat the Seventh, whom they announced to the nations as the true and 
rightful vicar of Christ. Their first choice, an involuntary and illegal 
act, was annulled by the fear of death and the menaces of the Ro- 
jnaiis; and their complaint is justified. by the strong evidence of proba- 
bility and fact. The twelve French cardinals, above two-thirds of the 
votes, were masters of the election; and -whatever might be their pro- 
vincial jealousies, it cannot fairly be presumed that they would have 
sacrificed their right and interest to a foreign candidate, who would 
never restore them to their native country. In the various, and often 
inconsistent, narratives, 67 the shades of popular violence are more 
darkly. or faintly coloured: but the licentiousness of the seditious Ro- 
mans was inflamed by a sense of their privileges, and the danger of 
a second emigration. The conclave was intimidated by the shouts, and 
encompassed by the arms, of thirty thousand rebels; the bells of the 
Capitol and St. Peter's rang an alarm; " Death, or an Italian pope! " 
was the universal cry; the same threat was repeated by the twelve ban- 
nerets or chiefs of the quarters, in the form of charitable advice; some 
preparations were made for burning the obstinate cardinals; and had 
they chosen a Transalpine subject, it is probable that they would never 
have departed alive from the Vatican. The same constraint imposed 
the necessity df dissembling in the eyes of Rome and of the world; the 
pride and cruelty of Urban presented a more inevitable danger; and 
they soon discovered the features of the tyrant, who could walk in his 
garden and recite his breviary while he heard from an adjacent cham- 
ber six cardinals groaning on the rack. His inflexible zeal, which loudly 
censured their luxury and vice, would have attached them to the sta-

tions and duties of their parishes at Rome; and had he not fatally de- 
layed a new promotion, the French cardinals would have been re- 
duced to a helpless minority in the sacred college. For these reasons, 
and in the hope of repassing the Alps, they rashly violated .the peace 
and unity of the church; and the merits of their double choice are yet 
agitated in the Catholic schools. 08 The vanity, rather than the inter- 
est of the nation, determined the court and clergy of France. * The 
states of Savoy, Sicily, Cyprus, Arragon, Castile, Navarre, and Scot- 
land, were inclined by their example and authority to the obedience 
of Clement the Seventh, and, after his decease, of Benedict the Thir- 
teenth. Rome and the principal states of Italy, Germany, Portugal, 
England, 70 the Low Countries, and the kingdoms of the North, adhered 
to the prior election of Urban the Sixth, who was succeeded by Boniface 
the Ninth, Innocent the Seventh, and Gregory the Twelfth. 

From the banks of the Tiber and the Rh&amp;ne the hostile pontiffs en- 
countered each other with the pen and the sword: the civil and ecclesi- 
astical order of society was disturbed; and the Romans had their full 
share of the mischiefs of which they may be arraigned as the primary 
authors. 71 They had vainly flattered themselves with the hope of re- 
storing the seat of the ecclesiastical monarchy, and of relieving their 
poverty with the tributes and offerings of the nations; but the separa- 
tion of France and Spain diverted the stream of lucrative devotion; 
nor could the loss be compensated by the two jubilees which were 
crowded into the space of ten years. By the avocations of the schism, 
by foreign arms, and popular tumults, Urban the Sixth and his three 
successors were often compelled to interrupt their residence in the Vati- 
can. The Colonna and Ursini still exercised their deadly feuds: the 
bannerets of Rome asserted and abused the privileges of a republic: 
the vicars of Christ, who had levied a military force, chastised their 
rebellion with the gibbet, the sword, and the dagger; and, in a friendly 
conference, eleven deputies of the people were perfidiously murdered 
and cast into the street. Since the invasion of Robert the Norman, the 

*"The ordinal numbers of the popes seem to decide the question against 
Clement VII. and Benedict XIII., who are boldly stigmatised as antipbpes 
by the Italians, while the French are content with authorities and reasons 
to plead the cause of doubt and toleration (Baluz. in Praefat). It is singular, 
or rather it is not singular, that saints, visions, and miracles should be 
common to both parties. . ' 

*Baluze strenuously labours (Not. p. 1271-1280) to justify the pure ana

Romans had pursued their domestic quarrels without the dangerous in- 
terposition of a stranger. But in the disorders of the schism, an aspir- 
ing neighbour, Ladislaus king of Naples, alternately supported and 
betrayed the pope and the people; by the former he was declared gon- 
falonier, or general, of the church, while the latter submitted to his 
choice the nomination of their magistrates. Besieging Rome by land 
and water, he thrice entered the gates as a barbarian conqueror; pro- 
faned the altars, violated the virgins, pillaged the merchants, per- 
formed his devotions at St. Peter's, and left a garrison in the castle of 
St. Angelo. His arms were sometimes unfortunate, and to a delay of 
three days he was indebted for his life and crown: but Ladislaus tri- 
umphed in his turn; and it was only his premature death that could 
save the metropolis and the ecclesiastical state from the ambitious con- 
queror, who had assumed the title, or at least the powers, of King of 
Rome. 72 

I have not undertaken the ecclesiastical history of the schism; but 
Rome, the object of these last chapters, is deeply interested in the dis- 
puted succession of her sovereigns. The first counsels for the peace and 
union of Christendom arose from the university of Paris, from the fac- 
ulty of the Sorbonne, whose doctors were esteemed, at least in the Galli- 
can church, as the most consummate masters of theological science. 75 
Prudently waiving all invidious inquiry into the origin and merits of 
the dispute, they proposed, as a healing measure, that the two pre- 
tenders of Rome and Avignon should abdicate at the same time, after 
qualifying the cardinals of the adverse factions to join in a legitimate 
election; and that the nations should subtract T4 their obedience, if 
either of the competitors preferred his own interest to that of the public. 
At each vacancy these physicians of the church deprecated the mis- 
chiefs of a hasty choice; but the policy of the conclave and the ambi- 
tion of its members were deaf to reason and entreaties; and whatsoever 
promises were made, the pope could never be bound by the oaths of 
the cardinal. During fifteen years the pacific designs of the university 
were eluded by the arts of the rival pontiffs, the scruples or passions of 
their adherents, and the vicissitudes of French factions, that ruled the 
insanity of Charles the Sixth. At length a vigorous resolution was em- 

*It is supposed by Giannonc (torn. in. p. 292) that he styled himself Rex 
Romae, a title unknown to the world since the expulsion of Tarquin. But 
a nearer inspection has justified the reading of Rex Ramac, of Rama, an 
obscure kingdom annexed to the crown of Hungary. 

"The leading and decisive part which France assumed in the schism is 
stated by Peter du Puis in a separate history, extracted from authentic 
records, and inserted in the seventh volume of the last and best edition of 
his* friend Thuanus (P. xi. p. 110-184). 

74 Of this measure, John Gerson, a stout doctor, was the author or the 
champion. The proceedings of the university of Paris and the Gallican 
church were often prompted by his advice, and are copiously displayed in 
his theological writings, of which Le Clerc (Bibliotheque Choisie, torn. x. 
p. 1-78) has given a valuable extract John Gerson acted an important 
part in the councils of Pisa and Constance. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE '849 

braced; and a solemn embassy, of the titular patriarch of Alexandria, 
two archbishops, five bishops, five abbots, three knights, and twenty 
doctors, was sent to the courts of Avignon and Rome, to require, in the 
name of the church and king, the abdication of the two pretenders, of 
Peter de Luna, who styled himself Benedict the Thirteenth, and of 
Angelo Corrario, who assumed the name of Gregory the Twelfth. For 
the ancient honour of Rome, and the success of their commission, the 
ambassadors solicited a conference with the magistrates of the city, 
whom they gratified by a positive declaration that the most Christian 
king did not entertain a wish of transporting the holy see from the. 
Vatican, which he considered as the genuine and proper seat of the 
successor of St. Peter. In the name of the senate and people, an elo- 
quent Roman asserted their desire to co-operate in the union of the 
church, deplored the temporal and spiritual calamities of the long 
schism, and requested the protection of France against the arms of 
the king of Naples. The answers of Benedict and Gregory were alike 
edifying and alike deceitful; and, in evading the demand of their abdi- 
cation, the two rivals were animated by a common spirit. They agreed 
on the necessity of a previous interview; but the time, the place, and 
the manner, could never be ascertained by mutual consent. " If the 
one advances," says a servant of Gregory, " the other retreats; the one 
appears an animal fearful of the land, the other a creature apprehen- 
sive of the water. And thus, for a short remnant of life and power, 
will these aged priests endanger the peace and salvation of the Chris- 
tian world." n 

The Christian world was at length provoked by their obstinacy and 
fraud: they were deserted by their cardinals, who embraced each other 
as friends and colleagues; and their revolt was supported by a numer- 
ous assembly of prelates and ambassadors. With equal justice, the 
council of Pisa deposed the popes of Rome and Avignon; the conclave 
was unanimous in the choice of Alexander the Fifth, and his vacant 
seat was soon filled by a similar election of John the Twenty-third, the 
most profligate of mankind. But instead of extinguishing the schism, 
the rashness of the French and Italians had given a third pretender to 
the chair of St. Peter. Such new claims of the synod and conclave 
were disputed; three kings, of Germany, Hungary, and Naples, adhered 
to the cause of Gregory the Twelfth: and Benedict the Thirteenth, 
himself a Spaniard, was acknowledged by the devotion and patriotism 
of that powerful nation. The rash proceedings of Pisa were corrected 
by the council of Constance; the emperor Sigismond acted a conspicu- 
ous part as the advocate or protector of the Catholic church; and .the 
number and weight of civil and ecclesiastical members might seem to

constitute the states-general of Europe. Of the three popes, John the 
Twenty-third was the first victim: he fled and was brought back a 
prisoner: the most scandalous charges were suppressed; the vicar of 
Christ was only accused of piracy, murder, rape, sodomy, and incest; 
and after subscribing his own condemnation, he expiated in prison the 
imprudence of trusting his person to a free city beyond the Alps. 
Gregory the Twelfth, whose obedience was reduced to the narrow pre- 
cincts of Rimini, descended with more honour from the throne; and his 
ambassador convened the session in which he renounced the title and 
authority of lawful pope. To vanquish the obstinacy of Benedict the 
Thirteenth or his adherents, the emperor in person undertook a jour- 
ney from Constance to Perpignan. The kings of Castile, Arragon, Na- 
varre, and Scotland, obtained an equal and honourable treaty: with the 
concurrence of the Spaniards, Benedict was deposed by the council; 
but the harmless old man was left in a solitary castle to excommunicate 
twice each day the rebel kingdoms which had deserted his cause. After 
thus eradicating the remains of the schism, the synod of Constance pro- 
ceeded with slow and cautious steps to elect the sovereign of Rome and 
the head of the church. On this momentous occasion the college of 
twenty-three cardinals was fortified with thirty deputies; six of whom 
were chosen in each of the five great nations of Christendom the Ital- 
ian, the German, the French, the Spanish, and the English: the in- 
terference of strangers was softened by their generous preference of an 
Italian and a Roman; and the hereditary, as well as personal, merit 
of Otho Colonna recommended him to the conclave* Rome accepted 

"I cannot overlook this great national cause, which was vigorously main- 
tained by the English ambassadors against those of France, The latter 
contended that Christendom was essentially distributed into the four great 
nations and votes of Italy, Germany, France, and Spain; and that the lesser 
kingdoms' (such as England, Denmark, Portugal, etc.) were comprehended 
under one or other of these great divisions. The English asserted that the 
British islands, of which^ they were the head, should be considered as a 
fifth and co-ordinate nation, with an equal vote; and every argument of 
truth or fable was introduced to exalt the dignity of their country. Including 
England, Scotland, Wales, the four kingdoms of Ireland, and the Orkneys, 
the British islands are decorated with eight royal crowns, and discriminated

The royal prerogative of coining money, which had been exercised 
near three hundred years by the senate, was first resumed by Martin 
the Fifth, 78 and his image and superscription introduce the series of the 
papal medals. Of his two immediate successors, Eugenius the Fourth

a Roman emperor. 80 I. The conflict of Eugenius with the fathers oi 
Basil, and the weight or apprehension of a new excise, emboldened and 
provoked the Romans to usurp the temporal government of the city. 
They rose in arms; elected seven governors of the republic, and a .con- 
stable of the Capitol; imprisoned the pope's nephew; besieged his per- 
son in the palace; and shot volleys of arrows into his bark as he es? 
caped down the Tiber in the habit of a monk. But he still possessed 
in the castle of St. Angelo a faithful garrison and a train of artillery: 
their batteries incessantly thundered on the city, and a bullet more 
dexterously pointed broke down the barricade of the bridge, and scat* 
tered with a single shot the heroes of the republic. Their constancy 
was exhausted by a rebellion of five months. Under the tyranny of thi 
Ghibeline nobles, the wisest patriots regretted the dominion of the 
church; and their repentance was unanimous and effectual. The troops 
of St. Peter again occupied the Capitol; the magistrates departed to 
their homes; the most guilty were executed or exiled; and the legate, 
at the head of two thousand foot and four thousand horse, was saluted 
as the father of the city. The synods of Ferrara and Florence, the 
fear or resentment of Eugenius, prolonged his absence: he was received 
by a submissive people; but the pontiff understood, from the acdama* 
tions of his triumphal entry, that, to secure their loyalty and his ,

II. Rome was restored, adorned, and enlightened, by the peaceful reign 
of Nicholas the Fifth. In the midst of these laudable occupations, the 
pope was alarmed by the approach of Frederic the Third of Austria; 
though his fears could not be justified by the character or the power 
of the Imperial candidate. After drawing his military force to the me- 
tropolis, and imposing the best security of oaths 81 and treaties, Nicho- 
las received with a smiling countenance the faithful advocate and vas- 
sal of the church. So tame were the times, so feeble was the Austrian, 
that the pomp of his coronation was accomplished with order and har- 
mony: but the superfluous honour was so disgraceful to an independent 
nation, that his successors have excused themselves from the toilsome 
pilgrimage to the Vatican, and rest their Imperial title on the choice 
of the electors of Germany. 

A citizen has remarked, with pride and pleasure, that the king of 
the Romans, after passing with a slight salute the cardinals and prel- 
ates who met him at the gate, distinguished the dress and person of the 
senator of Rome; and in this last farewell, the pageants of the empire 
and the republic were clasped in a friendly embrace. 8 - According to 
the laws of Rome 83 her first magistrate was required to be a doctor 
of laws, an aKen, of a place at least forty miles from the city, with 
whose inhabitants he must not be connected in the third canonical 
degree of blood or alliance. The election was annual: a severe scrutiny 
was instituted into the conduct of the departing senator; nor could 
he be recalled to the same office till after the expiration of two years. 
A liberal salary of three thousand florins was assigned for his expense 
and reward; and his public appearance represented the majesty of the 
republic. His robes were of gold brocade or crimson velvet, or in the 
summer season of a lighter silk: he bore in his hand an ivory sceptre; 
the sound of trumpets announced his approach; and his solemn steps 
were preceded at least by four lictors or attendants, whose red wands 
were enveloped with bands or streamers of the golden colour or livery 
of the city. His oath in the Capitol proclaims his right and duty, to 
observe and assert the laws, to control the proud, to protect the poor, 
and to exercise justice and mercy within the extent of his jurisdiction. 

w The oath of fidelity imposed on the emperor by the pope is recorded 
and sanctified in the Clementines (1. ii. tit ix.) ; and ^Eneas Sylvius, who 
objects to this, new demand, could not foresee that in a few years he should 
ascend the throne and imbibe the maxims of Boniface VIII.

In these useful functions he was assisted by three learned strangers; 
the two collaterals and the judge of criminal appeals: their frequent 
trials of robberies, rapes, and murders are attested by the laws; and 
the weakness of these laws connives at the licentiousness of private 
feuds and armed associations for mutual defence. But the senator was 
confined to the administration of justice: the Capitol, the treasury, and 
the government of the city and its territory were intrusted to the three 
conservators, who were changed four times in each year: the militia of 
the thirteen regions assembled under the banners of their respective 
chiefs, or caporioni; and the first of these was distinguished by the 
name and dignity of the prior . The popular legislature consisted of the 
secret and the common councils of the Romans. The former was com- 
posed of the magistrates and their immediate predecessors, with some 
fiscal and legal officers, and three classes of thirteen, twenty-six, and 
forty counsellors; amounting in the whole to about one hundred and 
twenty persons. In the common council all male citizens had a right to 
vote; and the value of their privilege was enhanced by the care with 
which any foreigners were prevented from usurping the title and char- 
acter of Romans. The tumult of a democracy was checked by wise 
and jealous precautions: except the magistrates, none could propose a 
question; none were permitted to speak, except from an open pulpit or 
tribunal; all disorderly acclamations were suppressed; the sense of the 
majority was decided by a secret ballot; and their decrees were pro- 
mulgated in the venerable name of the Roman senate and people. It 
would not be easy to assign a period in which this theory of govern- 
ment has been reduced to accurate and constant practice, since the 
establishment of order has been gradually connected with the decay of 
liberty. But in the year one thousand five hundred and eighty the 
ancient statutes were collected, methodised in three books, and adapted 
to present use, under the pontificate, and with the approbation, of 
Gregory the Thirteenth: 8 * this civil and criminal code is the modern 
law of the city; and, if the popular assemblies have been abolished, a 
foreign senator, with the three conservators, still resides in the palace 
of the Capitol. 88 The policy of the Caesars has been repeated by the 
popes; and the bishop of Rome affected to maintain the form of a re- 
public, while he reigned with the absolute powers of a temporal, as well 
as spiritual, monarch. 
It is an obvious truth that the times must be suited to extraordinary

characters, and that the genius of Cromwell or Retz might now expire 
in obscurity. The political enthusiasm of Rienzi had exalted him to a 
throne; the same enthusiasm, in the next century, conducted his imi- 
tator to the gallows. The birth of Stephen Porcaro was noble, his repu- 
tation spotless: his tongue was armed with eloquence, his mind was 
enlightened with learning; and he aspired, beyond the aim of vulgar 
ambition, to free his country and immortalise his name. The dominion 
of priests is most odious to a liberal spirit: every scruple was removed 
by the recent knowledge of the fable and forgery of Constantino's do- 
nation; Petrarch was now the oracle of the Italians; and as often as 
Porcaro revolved the ode which describes the patriot and hero of Rome, 
he applied to himself the visions of the prophetic bard. His first trial 
of the popular feelings was at the funeral of Eugenius the Fourth; in 
an elaborate speech he called the Romans to liberty and arms; and 
they listened with apparent pleasure till Porcaro was interrupted and 
answered by a grave advocate, who pleaded for the church and state. 
By every law the seditious orator was guilty of treason; but the benevo- 
lence of the new pontiff, who viewed his character with pity and esteem, 
attempted by an honourable office to convert the patriot into a friend. 
The inflexible Roman returned from Anagni with an increase of reputa- 
tion and zeal; and, on the first opportunity, the games of the place Na- 
vona, he tried to inflame the casual dispute of some boys and mechanics 
into a general rising of the people. Yet the humane Nicholas was still 
averse to accept the forfeit of his life; and the traitor was removed 
from the scene of temptation to Bologna, with a liberal allowance for 
his support, and the easy obligation of presenting himself each day be- 
fore the governor of the city. But Porcaro had learned from the 
younger Brutus that with tyrants no faith or gratitude should be ob- 
served: the exile disclaimed against the arbitrary sentence; a party 
and a conspiracy was gradually formed; his nephew, a daring youth, 
assembled a band of volunteers; and on the appointed evening a feast 
was prepared at his house for the friends of the republic. Their leader, 
who had escaped from Bologna, appeared among them in a robe of 
purple and gold: his voice, his countenance, his gestures, bespoke the 
man who had devoted his life or death to the glorious cause. In a 
studied oration he expatiated on the motives and the means of their 
enterprise; the name and liberties of Rome; the sloth and pride of their 
ecclesiastical tyrants; the active or passive consent of their fellow-citi- 
zens; three hundred soldiers and four hundred exiles, long exercised in 
arms or i* wrongs; the license of revenge to edge their swords, and a 
million of ducats to reward their victory. It would be easy (he said) 
on the next day, the festival of the Epiphany, to seize the pope and 
his cardinals before the doors or at the altar of St. Peter's; to lead them 
in chains under the walls of St. Angelo; to extort,, by the threat of their 
instant death, a surrender of the castle; to ascend the vacant Captitol; 
to ring the alarm-bell; and to restore in a popular assembly the ancient 
republic of Rome. ' While he triumphed, he was already betrayed* The

senator, with a strong guard, invested the house: the nephew of Por- 
caro cut his way through the crowd; but the unfortunate Stephen was 
drawn from a chest, lamenting that his enemies had anticipated by 
three hours the execution of his design. After such manifest and re- 
peated guilt even the mercy of Nicholas was silent. Porcaro, and 
nine of his accomplices, were hanged without the benefit of the sacra- 
ments; and, amidst the fears and invectives of the papal court, the 
Romans pitied, and almost applauded, these martyrs of their country. 80 
But their applause was mute, their pity ineffectual, their liberty for 
ever extinct; and, if they have since risen in a vacancy of the throne 
or a scarcity of bread, such accidental tumults may be found in the 
bosom of the most abject servitude. 

But the independence of the nobles, which was fomented by discord, 
survived the freedom of the commons, which must be founded in union. 
A privilege of rapine and oppression was long maintained by the barons 
of Rome: their houses were a fortress and a sanctuary; and the fero- 
cious train of banditti and criminals, whom they protected from the 
law, repaid the hospitality with the service of their swords and daggers. 
The private interest of the pontiffs, or their nephews, sometimes in- 
volved them in these domestic feuds. Under the reign of Sixtus the 
Fourth, Rome was distracted by the battles and sieges of the rival 
houses: after the conflagration of his palace, the protonotary Colonna 
was tortured and beheaded; and Savelli, his captive friend, was mur- 
dered on the spot for refusing to join in the acclamations of the vic- 
torious UrsinL 87 But the popes no longer trembled in the Vatican: 
they had strength to command, if they had resolution to daim, the 
obedience of their subjects; and the strangers who observed these par- 
tial disorders admired the easy taxes and wise administration of the 
ecclesiastical state, 88 

The spiritual thunders of the Vatican depend on the force of opinion;

and if that opinion be supplanted by reason or passion, the sound may 
idly waste itself in the air; and the helpless priest is exposed to the 
brutal violence of a noble or a plebeian adversary. But after their 
return from Avignon, the keys of St. Peter were guarded by the sword 
of St. Paul. Rome was commanded by an impregnable citadel: the 
use of cannon is a powerful engine against popular seditions: a regular 
force of cavalry and infantry was enlisted under the banners of the 
pope: his ample revenues supplied the resources of war; and, from the 
extent of his domain, he could bring down on a rebellious city an army 
of hostile neighbours and loyal subjects, 80 Since the union of the 
duchies of Ferrara and Urbino, the ecclesiastical state extends from the 
Mediterranean to the Adriatic, and from the confines of Naples to the 
banks of the Po; and as early as the sixteenth century the greater part 
of that spacious and fruitful country acknowledged the lawful claims 
and temporal sovereignty of the Roman pontiffs. Their claims were 
readily deduced from the genuine or fabulous donations of the darker 
ages: the successive steps of their final settlement would engage us too 
far in the transactions of Italy, and even of Europe; the crimes of 
Alexander the Sixth, the martial operations of Julius the Second, and 
the liberal policy of Leo the Tenth, a theme which has been adorned by 
the pens of the noblest historians of the times. 00 In the first period 
of their conquests, till the expedition of Charles the Eighth, the popes 
might successfully wrestle with the adjacent princes and states, whose 
military force was equal or inferior to their own. But as soon as the 
monarchs'of France, Germany, and Spain contended with gigantic arms 
for the dominion of Italy, they supplied with art the deficiency of 
strength, and concealed, in a labyrinth of wars and treaties, their as- 
piring views and the immortal hope of chasing the barbarians beyond 
the Alps. The nice balance of the Vatican was often subverted by the 
soldiers of the North and West, who were united under the standard 
of Charles the Fifth: the feeble and fluctuating policy of Clement the 
Seventh exposed his person and dominions to the conqueror; and Rome 
was abandoned seven months to a lawless army, more cruel and rapa- 
cious than the Goths and Vandals. 81 After this severe lesson the popes 

w By the economy of Sixtus V. the revenue of the ecclesiastical state was 
raised to two millions and a half of Roman crowns (Vita, torn, ii, p. 291-296) ; 
and so regular was the military establishment, that in one month Clement 
VIII. could invade the duchy of Ferrara with three thousand horse and 
twenty thousand foot (torn. iii. p. 64). Since that time (A.P, 1597) the papal 
arms are happily rusted, but the revenue must have gained some nominal 
increase.

of the former; in the Florentine history, the "Prince," and the political

contracted their ambition, which was almost satisfied, resumed the 
character of a common parent, and abstained from all offensive hostili- 
ties, except in a hasty quarrel, when the vicar of Christ and the Turkish 
sultan were armed at the same time against the kingdom of Naples. 92 
The French and Germans at length withdrew from the field of battle: 
Milan, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, and the sea-coast of Tuscany, were 
firmly possessed by the Spaniards; and it became their interest to main- 
tain the peace and dependence of Italy, which continued almost without 
disturbance from the middle of the sixteenth to the opening of the 
eighteenth century. The Vatican was swayed and protected by the re- 
ligious policy of the Catholic king: his prejudice and interest disposed 
him in every dispute to support the prince against the people; and in- 
stead of the encouragement, the aid, and the asylum which they ob- 
tained from the adjacent states, the friends of liberty or the enemies 
of law were enclosed on all sides within the iron circle of despotism. 
The long habits of obedience and education subdued the turbulent spirit 
of the nobles and commons of Rome. The barons forgot the arms and 
factions of their ancestors, and insensibly became the servants of luxury 
and government. Instead of maintaining a crowd of tenants and fol- 
lowers, the produce of their estates was consumed in the private ex- 
penses which multiply the pleasures and diminish the power of the 
lord. 03 The Colonna and Ursini vied with each other in the decoration 
of their palaces and chapels; and their antique splendour was rivalled 
or surpassed by the sudden opulence of the papal families. ^In Rome 
the voice of freedom and discord is no longer heard; and, instead of 
the foaming torrent, a smooth and stagnant lake reflects the image of 
idleness and servitude. 

A Christian, a philosopher , 94 and a patriot, will be equally scandalised 
by the temporal kingdom of the clergy; and the local majesty of Rome, 
the remembrance of her consuls and triumphs, may seem to embitter 
the sense and aggravate the shame of her slavery. If we calmly weigh 
the merits and defects of the ecclesiastical government, it may be 
praised in its present state as a mild, decent, and tranquil system, ex- 
empt from the dangers of a minority, the sallies of youth, the expenses 
of luxury, and the calamities of war. But these advantages are over- 
balanced by a frequent, perhaps a septennial, election of a sovereign, 

w The ambitious and feeble hostilities of the Caraffa pope^Paul IV., may 
be seen in Thuanus (1. xvi.-xviii.) and Giannone (torn. iv. p. 149-163). 
Those Catholic bigots, Philip II. and the duke of Alva, presumed to separate 
the Roman prince from the vicar of Christ; yet the holy character, which 
would have sanctified his victory, was decently applied to protect his defeat. 

"This gradual change of manners and expense is admirably explained 
by Dr. Adam Smith (Wealth of Nations, vol. i. p. 495-504), who proves, 
perhaps too severely, that the most salutary effects have flowed from the 
meanest and most selfish causes. 

* Mr. Hume (Hist, of England, vol. i. p. 389) too hastily concludes ;that, 
if the civil and ecclesiastical powers be united in the same person, it is of 
little moment whether he be styled prince or prelate, since the temporal 
character will always predominate.

who is seldom a native of the country: the reign of a young statesman 
of threescore, in the decline of his life and abilities, without hope to ac- 
complish, and without children to inherit, the labours of his transitory 
reign. The successful candidate is drawn from the church, and even 
the convent from the mode of education and life the most adverse to 
reason, humanity, and freedom. In the trammels of servile faith he has 
learned to believe because it is absurd, to revere all that is contempti- 
ble, and to despise whatever might deserve the esteem of a rational 
being; to punish error as a crime, to reward mortification and celibacy 
as the first of virtues; to place the saints of the calendar OB above the 
heroes of Rome and the sages of Athens; and to consider the missal, or 
the crucifix, as more useful instruments than the plough or the loom. 
In the office of nuncio, or the rank of cardinal, he may acquire some 
knowledge of the world; but the primitive stain will adhere to his mind 
and manners: from study and experience he may suspect the mystery of 
his profession; but the sacerdotal artist will imbibe some portion of the 
bigotry which he inculcates. The genius of Sixtus the Fifth burst 
from the gloom of a Franciscan cloister. In a reign of five years he 
exterminated the outlaws and banditti, abolished the profane sanctu- 
aries of Rome, 07 formed a naval and military force, restored and emu- 
lated the monuments of antiquity, and, after a liberal use and large 
increase of the revenue, left five millions of crowns in the castle of St. 
Angelo. But his justice was sullied with cruelty, his activity was 
prompted by the ambition of conquest: after his decease the abuses re- 
vived; the treasure was dissipated; he entailed on posterity thirty-five 
new taxes and the venality of offices; and, after his death, his statue 
was demolished by an ungrateful or an injured people. 08 The wild and 

**A Protestant may disdain the unworthy preference of St. Francis or 
St Dominic, but he will not rashly condemn the zeal or judgment of Sixtus 
V., who placed the statues of the apostles St Peter and St. Paul on the 
vacant columns of Trajan and Antonine. 

"A wandering Italian, Gregorio Leti, has given the Vita di Sisto Qumto

which does not command our absolute confidence. Yet the character of

Thuanus (1. Ixxxii. c. I, 2; 1. Ixxxiv. c, 10; 1, c. c. 8).

pontiffs: the maxims and effects of their temporal government may be 
collected from the positive and comparative view of the arts and phi- 
losophy, the agriculture and trade, the wealth and population, of the 
ecclesiastical state. For myself, it is my wish to depart in charity with 
all mankind, nor am I willing, in these last moments, to offend even

CHAPTER i33o-(i33M43o AD.) 



Prospect of the Ruins of Rome in the Fifteenth Century Four Causes of 
Decay and Destruction Example of the Coliseum Renovation of the 
City Conclusion of the whole Work 

IN the last days of Pope Eugenius the Fourth, two of his servants, the 
learned Poggitis * and a friend, ascended the Capitoline hill, reposed 
themselves among the ruins of columns and temples, and viewed from 
that commanding spot the wide and various prospect of desolation. 2 
The place and the object gave ample scope for moralising on the vi- 
cissitudes of fortune, which spares neither man nor the proudest of his 
works, which buries empires and cities in a common grave; and it was 
agreed that, in proportion to her former greatness, the fall of Rome 
was the more awful and deplorable. "Her primeval state, such as she 
might appear in a remote age, when Evander entertained the stranger 
of Troy, 8 has been delineated by the fancy of Virgil. This Tarpeian 
rock was then a savage and solitary thicket: in the time of the poet it 
was crowned with the golden roofs of a temple; the temple is over- 
thrown, the gold has been pillaged, the wheel of fortune has accom- 
plished her revolution, and the sacred ground is again disfigured with 
thorns and brambles. The hill of the Capitol, on which we sit, was 
formerly the head of the Roman empire, the citadel of the earth, the 
terror of kings; illustrated by the footsteps of so many triumphs, en- 
riched with the spoils and tributes of so many nations. This spectacle 
of the world, how is it f alien 1 how changed! how defaced! the path of 
victory is obliterated by vines, and the benches of the senators are con- 
cealed by a dunghill. Cast your eyes on the Palatine hill, and seek 
among the shapeless and enormous fragments the marble theatre, the 
obelisks, the colossal statues, the porticoes of Nero's palace: survey 
the other hills of the city, the vacant space is interrupted only by ruins 
and gardens- The forum of the Roman people, where they assembled

aborious writer, who aspires above the prejudices of a Catholic priest. 
He was born in the year 1672, and died in the year 1750, after passing near 
sixty years in .the libraries of Milan and Modena (Vita del Proposto

acter, and writings of Poggius; and particularly noticed the date of this 
elegant moral lecture on the varieties of fortune.

THE ROMAN EMPIRE 861 

to enact their laws and elect their magistrates, is now enclosed fdr 1 the 
cultivation of pot-herbs, or thrown open for the reception of swine and 
buffaloes. The public and private edifices, that were founded for 
eternity, lie prostrate, naked, and broken, like the limbs of a mighty 
giant; and the ruin is the more visible, from the stupendous relics that 
have survived the injuries of time and fortune." * 

These relics are minutely described by Poggius, one of the first who 
raised his eyes from the monuments of legendary to those of classic 
superstition. 5 i. Besides a bridge, an arch, a sepulchre, and the pyra- 
mid of Cestius, he could discern, of the age of the republic, a double 
row of vaults in the salt-office of the Capitol, which were inscribed with 
the name and munificence of Catulus. 2. Eleven temples were visible 
in some degree, from the perfect form of the Pantheon to the three 
arches and a marble column of the temple of Peace, which Vespasian 
erected after the civil wars and the Jewish triumph. 3. Of the num- 
ber, which he rashly defines, of seven thermos, or public baths, none 
were sufficiently entire to represent the use and distribution of the 
several paths; but those of Diocletian and Antoninus Caracalla still 
retained the titles of the founders, and astonished the curious specta- 
tor, who, in observing their solidity and extent, the variety of marbles, 
the size and multitude of the columns, compared the labour and ex- 
pense with the use and importance. Of the baths of Constantino, of 
Alexander, of Domitian, or rather of Titus, some vestige might yet be 
found. 4. The triumphal arches of Titus, Severus, and Constantine, 
were entire, both the structure and the inscriptions: a falling fragment 
was honoured with the name of Trajan; and two arches, then extant, 
in the Flaminian way, have been ascribed to the base memory of 
Faustina and Gallienus. 5. After the wonder of the Coliseum, Pog- 
gius might have overlooked a small amphitheatre of brick, most prob- 
ably for the use of the praetorian camp: the theatres of Marcellus and 
Pompey were occupied in a great measure by public and private build- 
ings; and in the Circus, Agonalis and Maximus, little more than the 
situation and the form could be investigated. 6. The columns of Tra- 
jan and Antonine were still erect; but the Egyptian obelisks were 
broken or buried. A people of gods and heroes, the workmanship of 
art, was reduced to one equestrian figure of gilt brass and to five marble

fl [With regard to the baths of Titus, Bury says, " It has been proved 
only quite recently (by excavations in 1895) that the baths of Titus and 
Trajan were distinct. It was not a case of baths built by Titus and restored 
or improved by Trajan. The Propylaea of the Thermae of Titus have bee 
found on the north side 9f the Coliseum: the baths of Trajan were to 
the north-east, almost adjoining. Lanciani says that on the Aventine there 
were large baths called the Thermae Decianae." 0. S.]

statues, of which the most conspicuous were the two horses of Phidias 
and Praxiteles. 7. The two mausoleums or sepulchres of Augustus and 
Hadrian could not totally be lost; but the former was only visible as a 
mound of earth, and the latter, the castle of St. Angelo, had acquired 
the name and appearance of a modern fortress. With the addition of 
some separate and nameless columns, such were the remains of the an- 
cient city; for the marks of a more recent structure might be detected 
in the walls, which formed a circumference of ten miles, included three 
hundred and seventy-nine turrets, and opened into the country by thir- 
teen gates. 

This melancholy picture was drawn above nine hundred years after 
the fall of the Western empire, and even of the Gothic kingdom of 
Italy. A long period of distress and anarchy, in which empire, and 
arts, and riches had migrated from the banks of the Tiber, was incap- 
able of restoring or adorning the city; and, as all that is human must 
retrograde if it do not advance, every successive age must have has- 
tened the ruin of the work of antiquity. To measure the progress of 
decay, and to ascertain, at each era, the state of each edifice, would be 
an endless and a useless labour; and I shall content myself with two 
observations which will introduce a short inquiry into the general 
causes and effects, i. Two hundred years before the eloquent com- 
plaint of Poggius, an anonymous writer composed a description of 
Rome, 7 His ignorance may repeat the same objects under strange and 
fabulous names. Yet this barbarous topographer had eyes and ears; 
he could observe the visible remains; he could listen to the tradition of 
the people; and he distinctly enumerates seven theatres, eleven baths, 
twelve arches, and eighteen palaces, of which many had disappeared 
before the time of Poggius. It is apparent that many stately monu- 
ments of antiquity survived till a late period, 8 and that the principles 
of destruction acted with vigorous and increasing energy in the thir- 
teenth and fourteenth centuries. 2. The same reflection must be ap- 
plied to the last three ages; and we should vainly seek the Septizonium 
of Severus, which is celebrated by Petrarch and the antiquarians of 
1 the sixteenth century. While the Roman edifices were still entire, the 
first blows, however weighty and impetuous, were resisted by the solid- 
ity of the mass and the harmony of the parts; but the slightest touch

some short but pertinent notes, has been published by Montfaucon (Diarium 
Italicum, p. 283-301), who thus delivers his own critical opinion: Scriptor

mous pilgrim of the ninth century, who, in his visit round the churches 
and holy places of Rome, touches on several buildings, especially porticoes, 
which had disappeared before the thirteenth century.

would precipitate the fragments of arches and columns, that already 
nodded to their fall. 

After a diligent inquiry I can discern four principal causes of the ruin 
of Rome, which continued to operate in a period of more than a thou- 
sand years. I. The injuries of time and nature. II. The hostile at- 
tacks of the barbarians and Christians. III. The use and abuse of the 
materials. And, IV. The domestic quarrels of the Romans. 

I. The art of man is able to construct monuments far more perma- 
nent than the narrow span of his own existence: yet these monuments, 
like himself, are perishable and frail; and in the boundless annals^of 
time his life and his labours must equally be measured as a fleeting 
moment. Of a simple and solid edifice it is not easy however to cir- 
cumscribe the duration. As the wonders of ancient days, the pyra- 
mids 10 attracted the curiosity of the ancients: a hundred generations, 
the leaves of autumn, 11 have dropped into the grave; and after the fall 
of the Pharaohs and Ptolemies, the Caesars and caliphs, the same pyra- 
mids stand erect and unshaken above the floods of the Nile. A complex 
figure of various and minute parts is more accessible to injury and de- 
cay; and the silent lapse of time is often accelerated by hurricanes and 
earthquakes, by fires and inundations. The air and earth have doubt- 
less been shaken; and the lofty turrets of Rome have tottered from 
their foundations; but the seven hills do not appear to be placed on the 
great cavities of the globe; nor has the city, in any age, been -exposed 
to the convulsions of nature, which, in the climate of Antioch, Lisbon, 
or Lima, have crumbled in a few moments the works of ages into dust. 
Fire is the most powerful agent of life and death: the rapid mischief 
may be kindled and propagated by the industry or negligence of man- 
kind; and every period of the Roman annals is marked by the repeti- 
tion of similar calamities. A memorable conflagration, the guilt or 
misfortune of Nero's reign, continued, though with unequal fury, either 
six or nine days. 13 Innumerable buildings, crowded in close and 
crooked streets, supplied perpetual fuel for the flames; and when they 
ceased, four only of the fourteen regions were left entire; three were 
totally destroyed, and seven were deformed by the relics of smoking 
and lacerated edifices. 18 In the full meridan of empire the metropolis

tracted scale of the Egyptian dynasties would fix them about 2000 years 

(Z. z 4 6). This natural but

Christians from November 15 of the same year.

arose with fresh beauty from her ashes; yet the memory of the old de- 
plored their irreparable losses, the arts of Greece, the trophies of vic- 
tory, the monuments of primitive or fabulous antiquity. In the days of 
distress and anarchy every wound is mortal, every fall irretrievable; 
nor can the damage be restored either by the public care of government, 
or the activity of private interest. Yet two causes may be alleged which 
render the calamity of fire more destructive to a flourishing than a de- 
cayed city. i. The more combustible materials of brick, timber, and 
metals, are first melted or consumed; but the flames may play without 
injury or effect on the naked walls and massy arches that have been 
despoiled of their ornaments. 2. It is among the common and plebeian 
habitations that a mischievous spark is most easily blown to a confla- 
gration; but as soon as they are devoured, the greater edifices which 
have resisted or escaped are left as so many islands in a state of soli- 
tude and safety. From her situation, Rome is exposed to the danger 
of frequent inundations. Without excepting the Tiber, the rivers that 
descend from either side of the Apennine have a short and irregular 
course; a shallow stream in the summer heats; an impetuous torrent 
when it is swelled in the spring or winter, by the fall of rain and the 
melting of the snows. When the current is repelled from the sea by 
adverse winds, when the ordinary bed is inadequate to the weight of 
waters, they rise above the banks, and overspread, without limits or 
control, the plains and cities of the adjacent country. Soon after the 
triumph of the first Punic war the Tiber was increased by unusual 
rains; and the inundation, surpassing all former measure of time and 
place, destroyed all the buildings that were situate below the hills of 
Rome. According to the variety of ground, the same mischief was pro- 
duced by different means; and the edifices were either swept away by 
the sudden impulse, or dissolved and undermined by the long continu- 
ance, of the flood. 14 Under the reign of Augustus the same calamity 
was renewed: the lawless river overturned the palaces and temples on 
its banks; 15 and, after the labours of the emperor in cleansing and 

fane and altar consecrated by Evander present! Herculi; the temple of 
Jupiter Stator, a vow of Romulus; the palace of Numa; the temple of 
Vesta cum Penatibus populi Romani. He then deplores the opes tot victoriis

the calamities of the pagan world.

widening the bed that was encumbered with ruins, 19 the vigilance of his 
successors was exercised by similar dangers and designs. The project 
of diverting into new channels the Tiber itself, or some of the depend- 
ent streams, was long opposed by superstition and local interests; 17 nor 
did the use compensate the toil and cost of the tardy and imperfect 
execution. The servitude of rivers is the noblest and most important 
victory which man has obtained over the licentiousness of nature; 18 and 
if such were the ravages of the Tiber under a firm and active govern- 
ment, what could oppose, or who can enumerate, the injuries of the city 
after the fall of the Western empire? A remedy was at length pro- 
duced by the evil itself: the accumulation of rubbish and the earth that 
has been washed down from the hills is supposed to have elevated the 
plain of Rome fourteen or fifteen feet, perhaps, above the ancient 
level; 1 * and the modern city is less accessible to the attacks of the 
river. 20 

II. The crowd of writers of every nation, who impute the destruc- 
tion of the Roman monuments to the Goths and the Christians, have 
neglected to inquire how far they were animated by a hostile principle, 
and how far they possessed the means and the leisure to satiate their 
enmity. In the preceding volumes of this History I have described the 
triumph of barbarism and religion; and I can only resume, in a few 
words, their real or imaginary connection with the ruin of ancient 
Rome. Our fancy may create, or adopt, a pleasing romance, that the 
Goths and Vandals sallied from Scandinavia, ardent to avenge the flight 
of Odin; 21 to break the chains, and to chastise the oppressors, of man- 
kind; that they wished to burn the records of classic literature, and to 

If the palace of Numa and temple of Vesta were thrown down in Horace's 
time, what was consumed of those buildings by Nero's fire could hardly 
deserve the epithets of vetustissima or incorrupta. 

M Ad coercendas inundationes alveum Tiberis laxavit ac repurgavit, com- 
pletum olim ruderibus, et aedificiorum prolapsionibus coarctatum (Suetonius in 
Augusto, c. 30). 

Tacitus (Annal. i. 79) reports the petitions of the different towns of 
Italy to the senate against the measure : and we may applaud the progress of 
reason. On a similar occasion local interests would undoubtedly be con- 
sulted; but an English House of Commons would reject with contempt the 
arguments of superstition, "that nature had assigned to the rivers their 
proper course," etc. 

"See the Epoques de la Nature of the eloquent and philosophic Buffon. 
His picture of Guyana, in South America, is that of a new and savage land, 
in which die waters are abandoned to themselves, without being regulated 
by human industry (p. 212, 561, quarto edition). 

w ln his Travels in Italy, Mr. Addison (his Works, vol. ii. p. 98, Basker- 
ville's edition) has observed this curious and unquestionable fact. 

M Yet in modern times the Tiber has sometimes damaged the city, and 
in the years 1530, 1557, 1598, the Annals of Muratori record three mischievous 
and memorable inundations (torn. xiv. p. 268, 429; torn. xv. p. 99, etc.). 

a l take this opportunity of declaring that, in the course of twelve years, 
I have forgotten, or renounced, the flight of Odin from Azoph to Sweden, 
which I never very seriously believed. The Goths are apparently Germans; 
but all beyond Caesar and Tacitus is darkness or fable in the antiquities 
of Germany,

found their national architecture on the broken members of the Tuscan 
and Corinthian orders. But in simple truth, the northern conquerors 
were neither sufficiently savage, nor sufficiently refined, to entertain 
such aspiring ideas of destruction and revenge. The shepherds of 
Scythia and Germany had been educated in the armies of the empire, 
whose discipline they acquired, and whose weakness they invaded: with 
the familiar use of the Latin tongue they had learned to reverence the 
name and titles of Rome; and, though incapable of emulating, they 
were more inclined to admire than to abolish the arts and studies of a 
brighter period. In the transient possession of a rich and unresisting 
capital, the soldiers cf Alaric and Genseric were stimulated by the pas* 
sions of a victorious army; amidst the wanton indulgence of lust or 
cruelty, portable wealth was the object of their search: nor could they 
derive either pride or pleasure from the unprofitable reflection that they 
had battered to the ground the works of the consuls and Caesars. Their 
moments were indeed precious: the Goths evacuated Rome on the 
sixth, 22 the Vandals on the fifteenth day; 23 and, though it be far more 
difficult to build than to destroy, their hasty assault would have made 
a slight impression on the solid piles of antiquity. We may remember 
that both Alaric and Genseric affected to spare the buildings of the 
city; that they subsisted in strength and beauty under the auspicious 
government of Theodoric;* 4 and that the momentary resentment of 
Totila 2tt was disarmed by his own temper and the advice of his friends 
and enemies. From these innocent barbarians the reproach may be 
transferred to the Catholics of Rome. The statues, altars, and houses 
of the demons were an abomination in their eyes; and in the absolute 
command of the city, they might labour with zeal and perseverance to 
erase the idolatry of their ancestors. The demolition of the temples in 
the East 2C affords to them an example of conduct, and to us an argu- 
ment of belief; and it is probable that a portion of guilt or merit may 
be imputed with justice to the Roman proselytes. Yet their abhorrence 
was confined to the monuments of heathen superstition; and the civil 
structures that were dedicated to the business or pleasure of society 
might be preserved without injury or scandal. The change of religion 
was accomplished, not by a popular tumult, but by the decrees of the 
emperors, of the senate, and of time. Of the Christian hierarchy, the 
bishops of Rome were commonly the most prudent and least fanatic; 
nor can any positive charge be opposed to the meritorious act of saving 
and converting the majestic structure of the Pantheon.**

THE ROMAN EMPIRE 867 

III. The value of any object that supplies the wants or pleasures of* 
mankind is compounded of its substance and its form, of the materials 
and the manufacture. Its price must depend on the number of persons 
by whom it may be acquired and used; on the extent of the market; 
and consequently on the ease or difficulty of remote exportation, ac- 
cording to the nature of the commodity, its local situation, and the tem- 
porary circumstances of the world. The barbarian conquerors of Rome 
usurped in a moment the toil and treasure of successive ages; but, ex- 
cept the luxuries of immediate consumption, they must view without 
desire all that could not be removed from the city hi the Gothic wag- 
gons or the fleet of the Vandals. 28 Gold and silver were the first ob- 
jects of their avarice; as in every country, and in the smallest com- 
pass, they represent the most ample command of the industry and pos- 
sessions of mankind. A vase or a statue of those precious metals might 
tempt the vanity of some barbarian chief; but the grosser multitude, 
regardless of the form, was tenacious only of the substance; and the 
melted ingots might be readily divided and stamped into the current 
coin of the empire. The less active or less fortunate robbers were re- 
duced to the baser plunder of brass, lead, iron, and copper: whatever 
had escaped the Goths and Vandals was pillaged by the Greek tyrants; 
and the emperor Constans, in his rapacious visit, .stripped the bronze 
tiles from the roof of the Panthepn. 30 The edifices of Rome might .be 
considered as a vast and various mine; the first labour of extracting the 
materials was already performed; the metals were purified and cast; 
the marbles were hewn and polished; and after loreign and domestic 
rapine had been satiated, the remains of the city, could a purchaser 
have been found, were still venal. The monuments of antiquity had 
been left naked of their precious ornaments; but the Romans would 
demolish with their own hands the arches and walls, if the hope of 
profit? could .surpass the cost of the labour and exportation. If Charle- 
magne had fixed in Italy the seat of the Western empire, his genius 
would have aspired to restore, rather than to violate, the works of the 
Caesars; but policy confined the French monarch to the forests of Ger- 
many; bis taste could be gratified only by destruction; and the : n&lt;ew

the Pantheon had been vowed by Agrippa to Cybele and Neptune, and was 
dedicated by Boniface IV. on the calends of November to the Virgin, qtise 
est mater omnium sanctorum (p. 297, 298). ; 

*Flaminius Vacca (apud Montfaucon, p. 155, 156: his memoir is likewise 
printed P. 21, at the end of the Roma Antica of Nardini) and several 
Romans, doctrina graves, were persuaded that the Goths buried their treasures 
at Rome, and bequeathed the secret marks filiis nepotibusque. He relates 
some anecdotes to prove that, in his own time, these places were visited and 
nfled by the Transalpine pilgrims, the heirs of the Gothic conquerors^

pretence of plundering a heathen .temple ; the Pantheon was already a Oa&amp;otw

palace of Aix-la-Chapelle was decorated with the marbles of Ravenna 8a 
and Rome. 31 Five hundred years after Charlemagne, a king of Sicily, 
Robert, the wisest and most liberal sovereign of the age, was supplied 
with the same materials by the easy navigation of the Tiber and the 
sea; and Petrarch sighs in indignant complaint, that the ancient capi- 
tal of the world should adorn from her own bowels the slothful luxury 
of Naples. 32 But these examples of plunder or purchase were rare in 
the darker ages; and the Romans, alone and unenvied, might have ap- 
plied to their private or public use the remaining structures of antiq- 
uity, if in their present form and situation they had not been useless 
in a great measure to the city and its inhabitants. The walls still de- 
scribed the old circumference, but the city had descended from the 
seven hills into the Campus Martius; and some of the noblest monu- 
ments which had braved the injuries of time were left in a desert far 
remote from the habitations of mankind. The palaces of the senators 
were no longer adapted to the manners or fortunes of their indigent 
successors: the use of baths S3 and porticoes was forgotten: in the sixth 
century the games of the theatre, amphitheatre, and circus had been 
interrupted: some temples were devoted to the prevailing worship; but 
the Christian churches preferred the holy figure of the cross; and fash-

ion, or reason, had distributed after a peculiar model the cells and of- 
fices of the cloister. Under the ecclesiastical reign the number of these 
pious foundations was enormously multiplied; and the city was crowded 
with forty monasteries of men, twenty of women, and sixty chapters 
and colleges of canons and priests, 84 who aggravated, instead of reliev- 
ing, the depopulation of the tenth century. But if the forms of ancient 
architecture were disregarded by a people insensible of their use and 
beauty, the plentiful materials were applied to every call of necessity 
or superstition; till the fairest columns of the Ionic and Corinthian or- 
ders, the richest marbles of Paros and Numidia, were degraded, per- 
haps to the support of a convent or a stable. The daily havoc which is 
perpetrated by the Turks in the cities of Greece and Asia may afford 
a melancholy example; and in the gradual destruction of the monu- 
ments of Rome, Sixtus the Fifth may alone be excused for employing 
the stones of the Septizonium in the glorious edifice of St. Peter's. 86 A 
fragment, a ruin, howsoever mangled or profaned, may be viewed with 
pleasure and regret; but the greater part of the marble was deprived 
of substance, as well as of place and proportion; it was burnt to lime 
for the purpose of cement. Since the arrival of Poggius the temple of 
Concord 30 and many capital structures had vanished from his eyes; 
and an epigram of the same age expresses a just and pious fear that the 
continuance of this practice would finally annihilate all the monuments 
of antiquity. 37 The smallness of their numbers was the sole check on 
the demands and depredations of the Romans. The imagination of 
Petrarch might create the presence of a mighty people; 38 and I hesi- 
tate to believe that, even in the fourteenth century, they could be re- 
duced to a contemptible list of thirty-three thousand inhabitants. From 
that period to the reign of Leo the Tenth, if they multiplied to the

amount of eighty-five thousand," the increase of citizens was in some 
degree pernicious to the ancient city. 

IV. I have reserved for the last the most potent and forcible cause 
of destruction, the domestic hostilities of the Romans themselves. Un- 
der the dominion of the Greek and French emperors the peace of the 
city was disturbed by accidental, though frequent, seditions: it is from 
the decline of the latter, from the beginning of the tenth century, that 
we may date the licentiousness of private war, which violated with im- 
punity the laws of the Code and the Gospel, without respecting the maj- 
esty of the absent sovereign, or the presence and person of the vicar of 
Christ. In a dark period of five hundred years Rome was perpetually 
afflicted by the sanguinary quarrels of the nobles and the people, the 
Guelphs and Ghibelines, the Colpnna and Ursini; and if much has es- 
caped the knowledge, and much is unworthy of the notice, of history, I 
have exposed in the two preceding chapters the causes and effects of 
the public disorders. At such a time, when every quarrel was decided 
by the sword, and none could trust their lives or properties to the im- 
potence of law, the powerful citizens were armed for safety, or offence, 
against the domestic enemies whom they feared or hated. Except Ven- 
ice alone, the same dangers and designs were common to all the free 
republics of Italy; and the nobles usurped the prerogative of fortifying 
their houses, and erecting strong towers * that were capable of resist- 
ing a sudden attack. The cities were filled with these hostile edifices; 
and the example of Lucca, which contained three hundred towers; hei 
law, which confined their height to the measure of fourscore feet, may 
be extended with suitable latitude to the more opulent and populous 
states. The first step of the senator Brancaleone in the establishment 
of peace and justice was to demolish (as we have already seen) one 
hundred and forty of the towers of Rome; and, in the last days of 
anarchy and discord, as late as the reign of Martin the Fifth, forty- 
four still stood in one of the thirteen or fourteen regions of the city* 
To this mischievous purpose the remains of antiquity were most readily 
adapted: the temples and arches afforded a broad and solid basis for 
the new structures of brick and stone; and we can name the modern 
turrets that were raised on the triumphal monuments of Julius Caesar, 
Titus,, and the Antonines. 41 With some slight alterations, a theatre, 
an amphitheatre, a mausoleum, was transformed into a strong and spa- 

38 These states of the population of Rome at different periods are derived 
from an ingenious treatise of the physician Lancisi, de Komani Cocli 
Qualitatibus (p. 122).

of Italy, may be found m the laborious .and entertaining compilation of

clous citadel. I need not repeat that the mole of Hadrian has assumed 
the title and form of the castle of St. Angelo; 42 the Septizonium of 
Severus was capable of standing against a royal army; 43 the sepulchre 
of Metella has sunk tinder its outworks; 44 the theatres of Pompey and 
Marcellus were occupied by the Savelli and Ursini families; 45 and the 
rough fortress has been gradually softened to the splendour and ele- 
gance of an Italian palace. Even the churches were encompassed with 
arms and bulwarks, and the military engines on the roof of St. Peter's 
were the terror of the Vatican and the scandal of the Christian world. 
Whatever is fortified will be attacked; and whatever is attacked may 
be destroyed. Could the Romans have wrested from the popes the 
castle of St. Angelo, they had resolved by a public decree to annihilate 
that monument of servitude. Every building of defence was exposed to 
a siege; and in every siege the arts and engines of destruction were 
laboriously employed. After the death of Nicholas the Fourth, Rome, 
without a sovereign or a senate, was abandoned six months to the fury 
of civil war. " The houses," says a cardinal and poet of the times,"

"were crushed by the weight and velocity of enormous stones; 47 the 
walls were perforated by the strokes of the battering-ram; the towels 
were involved in fire and smoke; and the assailants were stimulated 
by rapine and revenge." The work was consummated by the tyranny 
of the laws; and the factions of Italy alternately exercised a blind and 
thoughtless vengeance on their adversaries, whose houses and castles 
they razed to the ground. 48 In comparing the days of foreign with the 
ages of domestic hostility, we must pronounce that the latter have been 
far more ruinous to the city; and our opinion is confirmed by the evi- 
dence of Petrarch. " Behold," says the laureate, " the relics of Rome, 
the image of her pristine greatness! neither time nor the barbarian 
can boast the merit of this stupendous destruction: it was perpetrated 
by her own citizens, by the most illustrious of her sons; and your an- 
cestors (he writes to a noble Annibaldi) have done with the battering- 
ram what the Punic hero could not accomplish with the sword." 4t&gt; The 
influence of the two last principles of decay must in some degree be 
multiplied by each other; since the houses and towers which were sub- 
verted by civil war required a new and perpetual supply from the mon- 
uments of antiquity. 

These general observations may be separately applied to the amphi- 
theatre of Titus, which has obtained the name of the COLTSEUM/ 
either from its magnitude, or from Nero's colossal statue: an edifice, 
had it been left to time and nature, which might perhaps have claimed 
an eternal duration. The curious antiquaries, who have computed the 
numbers and seats, are disposed to believe that above the upper row 
of stone steps the amphitheatre was encircled and elevated with several 

* T Muratori (Dissertazione sopra le Antiquiti Italiane, torn. i. p. 427-431) 
finds that stone bullets of two or three hundred pounds' weight were not 
uncommon; and they are sometimes computed at twelve or eighteen cantarl 
t&gt;f^ Genoa, each cantaro weighing 150 pounds. 

48 The sixth law of the Visconti prohibits this common and mischievous 
practice; and strictly enjoins that the houses of banished citizens should 
be preserved pro communi utilitate (Gualvaneus de la Flamma, in Muratori 
Script. Rerum Italicarum, torn. xii. p. 1041). 

"Eetrarch thus addresses his friend, who, with shame and tears, had 
shown him the moenia, lacerae specimen miserabile Romae, and declared hia 
own intention of restoring them (Carmina Latina, L ii. epist Paulo Anni- 
halensi, xiL p. 97, 98).

"The fourth part of the Verona Illustrata of the Marquis Maffei pro- 
fessedly treats of amphitheatres, particularly those of Rome and Verona, 
/&gt;f their dimensions, wooden galleries, etc. It is from magnitude that he 
-derives the name of Colosseum, or Coliseum: since the same appellation 
was applied to the amphitheatre of Capua, without the aid of a colossal 
statue; since that of Nero was erected in the court (in atrio) of his palace,

stages of wooden galleries, which were repeatedly consumed by fire, and 
restored by the emperors. Whatever was precious, or portable, or pro- 
fane, the statues of gods and heroes, and the costly ornaments of sculp- 
ture, which were cast in brass, or overspread with leaves of silver and 
gold, became the first prey of conquest or fanaticism, of the avarice of 
the barbarians or the Christians. In the massy stones of the Coliseum 
many holes are discerned; and the two most probable conjectures rep- 
resent the various accidents of its decay. These stones were connected 
by solid links of brass or iron, nor had the eye of rapine overlooked the 
value of the baser metals; 51 the vacant space was converted into a fair 
or market; the artisans of the Coliseum are mentioned in an ancient 
survey; and the chasms were perforated or enlarged to receive the poles 
that supported the shops or tents of the mechanic trades, 82 Reduced to 
its naked majesty, the Flavian amphitheatre was contemplated with 
awe and admiration by the pilgrims of the North; and their rude en- 
thusiasm broke forth in a sublime proverbial expression, which is re- 
corded in the eighth century, in the fragments of the venerable Bede: 
" As long as the Coliseum stands, Rome shall stand; when the Coliseum 
falls, Rome will fall; when Rome falls, the world will fall." BS In the 
modern system of war, a situation commanded by three hills would 
not be chosen for a fortress; but the strength of the walls and arches 
could resist the engines of assault; a numerous garrison might be lodged 
in the enclosure; and while one faction occupied the Vatican and the 
Capitol, the other was intrenched in the Lateran and the Coliseum. 5 * 
The abolition at Rome of the ancient games must be understood wth 
some latitude; and the carnival sports, of the Testacean mount, and 
the Circus Agonalis, 56 were regulated by the law 56 or custom of the 

w Joseph Maria Suares, a learned bishop, and the author of a history of 
Pneneste, has composed a separate dissertation on the seven or eight probable 
causes of these holes, which has been since reprinted in the Roman Thesaurus 
of Sallcngre. Montfaucon (Diarium, p. 233) pronounces the rapine of the 
barbarians to be the unam germanamque causam foraminum.

Rome before the year 735, the era of Bede's death; for I do not believe that 
our venerable monk ever passed the sea. 

M I cannot recover, in Muratori's original Lives of the Popes (Script 
Rerum Italicarum, torn. iii. P. L), the passage that attests this hostile partition, 
which must be applied to the end of the eleventh or the beginning of the 
twelfth century. 

"Although the structure of the Circus Agonalis be destroyed, it still retains 
tts form and name (Agona, Nagona, Nayona) ; and the interior space affords 
a sufficient level for the purpose of racing. But the Monte Testaceo, that

hurling from top to bottom some waggon-loads of live hogs for the diversion 
of the populace (Statuta Urbfs Rom*, p. 186).

city. The senator presided with dignity and pomp to adjudge and dis- 
tribute the prizes, the gold ring, or the pallium, as it was styled, of 
cloth or silk. A tribute on the Jews supplied the annual expense; 58 and 
the races, on foot, on horseback, or in chariots, were ennobled by a tilt 
and tournament of seventy-two of the Roman youth. In the year one 
thousand three hundred and thirty-two, a bull-feast, after the fashion 
of the Moors and Spaniards, was celebrated in the Coliseum itself; and 
the living manners are painted in a diary of the times. 00 A convenient 
order of benches was restored; and a general proclamation, as far as 
Rimini and Ravenna, invited the nobles to exercise their skill and cour- 
age in this perilous adventure. The Roman ladies were marshalled in 
three squadrons, and seated in three balconies, which on this day, the 
third of September, were lined with scarlet cloth. The fair Jacova di 
Rovere led the matrons from beyond the Tiber, a pure and native race, 
who still represent the features and character of antiquity. The re- 
mainder of the city was divided as usual between the Colonna and Ur- 
sini: the two factions were proud of the number and beauty of their 
female bands: the charms of Savella Ursini are mentioned with praise; 
and the Colonna regretted the absence of the youngest of their house, 
who had sprained her ankle in the garden of Nero's tower. The lots of 
the champions were drawn by an old and respectable citizen; and they 
descended into the arena, or pit, to encounter the wild bulls, on foot as 
it should seem, with a single spear. Amidst the crowd, our annalist has 
selected the names, colours, and devices of twenty of the most con- 
spicuous knights. Several of the names are the most illustrious of Rome 
and the ecclesiastical state: Malatesta, Polenta, della Valle, Cafarello, 
Savelli, Capoccio, Conti, Annibaldi, Altieri, Corsi: the colours were 
adapted to their taste and situation; the devices are expressive of hope 
or despair, and breathe the spirit of gallantry and arms. " I am alone, 
like the youngest of the Horatii," the confidence of an intrepid stranger: 
" I live disconsolate," a weeping widower: " I burn under the ashes," a 
discreet lover: " I adore Lavinia, or Lucretia," the ambiguous declara- 
tion of a modern passion: " My faith is as pure," the motto of a white 
livery: "Who is stronger than myself? " of a lion's hide: "If I am

"The Pallium, which Menage so foolishly derives from Palmarium, is an 
easy extension of the idea and the words, from the robe or cloak to the 
materials, and from thence to their application as a prize (Muratori, dissert 
xxxiii.). 

88 For these expenses the Jews of Rome paid each year 1130 florins, of which 
the odd thirty represented the pieces of silver for which Judas had betrayed 
his Master to their ancestors. There was a foot-race of Jewish as well as of 
Christian youths (Statuta Urbis, ibidem), 

"This extraordinary bull-feast in the Coliseum is described, from tradition 
rather than memory, by Ludovico Buonconte Monaldesco, in the most ancient 
fragments of Roman annals (Muratori, Script Rerum Italicarum, torn. xii.

with the colours of truth and nature. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 875 

frowned in blood, what a pleasant death! " the wish of ferocious cour- 
age. The pride or prudence of the Ursini restrained them from the 
field, which was occupied by three of their hereditary rivals, whose in- 
scriptions denoted the lofty greatness of the Colonna name: " Though 
sad, I am strong:" "Strong as I am great:" "If I fall," addressing 
himself to the spectators, " you fall with me: " intimating (says the 
contemporary writer) that, while the other families were the subjects 
of the Vatican, they alone were the supporters of the Capitol. The 
combats of the amphitheatre were dangerous and bloody. Every 
champion successively encountered a wild bull; and the victory may be 
ascribed to the quadrupeds, since no more than eleven were left on the 
field, with the loss of nine wounded and eighteen killed on the side of 
their adversaries. Some of the noblest families might mourn, but the 
pomp of the funerals, in the churches of St. John Lateran and Sta, 
Maria Maggiore, afforded a second holiday to the people. Doubtless 
it was not in such conflicts that the blood of the Romans should have 
been shed; yet, in blaming their rashness, we are compelled to ap- 
plaud their gallantry; and the noble volunteers, who display their mag- 
nificence, and risk their lives, under the balconies of the fair, excite a 
more generous sympathy than the thousands of captives and malefac- 
tors who were reluctantly dragged to the scene of slaughter, 60 

This use of the amphitheatre was a rare, perhaps a singular, festi- 
val: the demand for the materials was a daily and continual want, 
which the citizens could gratify without restraint or remorse. In the 
fourteenth century a scandalous act of concord secured to both factions 
the privilege of extracting stones from the free and common quarry of 
the Coliseum; 01 and Poggius laments that the greater part of these 
stones had been burnt to lime by the folly of the Romans. 62 To check 
thiis abuse, and to prevent the nocturnal crimes that might be perpe- 
trated in tie vast and gloomy recess, Eugenius the Fourth surrounded 
it with a wall; and, by a charter, long extant, granted both the ground 
and edifice to the monks of an adjacent convent. 63 After his death the 

*Muratori has given a separate dissertation (the xxixth) to the games of 
the Italians in the middle ages. 

**In a concise but instructive memoir, the abbe Barthelemy (Memoires de

for the present age, must be very tenderly applied to the fifteenth century. 

[The injury which the Coliseum has received has been less from the tooth 
of time than from earthquakes and the vandalism of man. The earthquake 
of 1348 destroyed the whole western side, after which the ruins were freely 
used as a quarry. Gibbon has followed Donatus in believing that a silk 
manufactory was established in the Coliseum in the thirteenth century. The 
Bandonarii or Bandererii were the officers who carried the standards of their

wall was overthrown in a tumult of the people; and had they them- 
selves respected the noblest monument of their fathers, they might 
have justified the resolve that it should never be degraded to private 
property. The inside was damaged; but in the middle of the sixteenth 
century, an era of taste and learning, the exterior circumference of one 
thousand six hundred and twelve feet was still entire and inviolate; a 
triple elevation of fourscore arches, which rose to the height of one 
hundred and eight feet. Of the present ruin the nephews of Paul the 
Third are the guilty agents; and every traveller who views the Farnese 
palace may curse the sacrilege and luxury of these upstart princes.* 14 
A similar reproach is applied to the Barberini; and the repetition of 
injury might be dreaded from every reign, till the Coliseum was placed 
under the safeguard of religion by the most liberal of the pontiffs, Bene- 
dict the Fourteenth, who consecrated a spot which persecution and 
fable had stained with the blood of so many Christian martyrs. 08 

When Petrarch first gratified his eyes with a view of those monu- 
ments whose scattered fragments so far surpass the most eloquent de- 
scriptions, he was astonished at the supine indifference l&gt; of the Ro- 
mans themselves; 67 he was humbled rather than elated by the discovery 
that, except his friend Rienzi, and one of the Colonna, a stranger of 
the Rh6ne was more conversant with these antiquities than the nobles 
and natives of the metropolis. 68 The ignorance and credulity of the 
Romans are elaborately displayed in the old survey of the city which 
was composed about the beginning of the thirteenth century; and, 
without dwelling on the manifold errors of name and place, the legend 
of the Capitol 00 may provoke a smile of contempt and indignation, 

** After measuring the priscus amphitheatri gyrus, Montfaucon (p. 142) only 
adds that it was entire under Paul III.; tacenclo clamat. Muratori (Annuli 
d' Italia, torn. xiv. p. 371) more freely reports the guilt of the Farnt'se pope, 
and the indignation of the Roman people. Against the nephews of Urban VFTL 
I have no other evidence than the vulgar saying, " Quod non f ecerunt Barhari, 
fecere Barberini," which was perhaps suggested by the resemblance of the 
words. 

68 As an antiquarian and a priest, Montfaucon thus deprecates the ruin of 
the Coliseum : Quod si non suopte merito atque pulchritudine dignum f uisset 
quod improbas arceret manus, indigna res utique in locum tot martyrum cruore 
sacrum tantopere saevitum esse.

richest and most curious carving. Below the citadel stood a palace, of 
gold for the greatest part, decorated with precious stones, and whose 
value might be esteemed at one third of the world itself. The statues 
of all the provinces were arranged in order; each with a small bell sus- 
pended from its neck; and such was the contrivance of art magic/ 
that, if the province rebelled against Rome, the statue turned round to 
that quarter of the heavens, the bell rang, the prophet of the Capitol 
reported the prodigy, and the senate was admonished of the impending 
danger." A second example, of less importance, though of equal ab- 
surdity, may be drawn from the two marble horses, led by two naked 
youths, which have since been transported from the baths of Constan- 
tine to the Quirinal hill. The groundless application of the names of 
Phidias and Praxiteles may perhaps be excused; but these Grecian 
sculptors should not have been removed above four hundred years from 
the age of Pericles to that of Tiberius; they should not have been 
transformed into two philosophers or magicians, whose nakedness was 
the symbol of truth and knowledge, who revealed to the emperor his 
most secret actions; and, after refusing all pecuniary recompense, so- 
licited the honour of leaving this eternal monument of themselves. 71 
Thus awake to the power of magic, the Romans were insensible to the 
beauties of art: no more than five statues were visible to the eyes of 
Poggius; and of the multitudes which chance or design had buried un- 
der the ruins, the resurrection was fortunately delayed till a safer and 
more enlightened age. 72 The Nile, which now adorns the Vatican, had 

magicam artem disppsitae, ut quando aliqua regio Romano Imperio rebellis 
erat, statim imago illius provinciae vertebat se contra illam; unde tintin- 
nabulum resonabat quod pendebat ad collum; tuncque vates Capitolii qui 
crant custodes senatui, etc. He mentions an example of the Saxons and Suevi, 
who, after they had been subdued by Agrippa, again rebelled: tintinnabuluni 
sonuit; sacerdos qui erat in speculo in hebdomada senatoribus nuntiavh: 

Agrippa marched back and reduced the Persians (Anonym, in Mont- 

faucon, p. 297, 298). 

10 The same writer affirms that Virgil captus a Romanis invisibiliter exift, 
ivitque Neapolim. A Roman magician, in the eleventh century, is introduced 
by William of Malmesbury (de Gestis Regum Anglorum, 1. ii. p. 86) ; and in 
the time of Flaminius Vacca (No. 81, 103) it was the vulgar belief that the 
strangers (the Goths) invoked the demons for the discovery of hidden 
treasures. 

w Anonym, p. 289, Montfaucon (p. 191) justly observes that, if Alexander 
be represented, these statues cannot be the work of Phidias (Olympiad 
Ixxxiii.) or Praxiteles (Olympiad civ.), who lived before that conqueror (Plin. 
Hist. Natur. xxxiv. 19). 

"William of Malmesbury (1. ii. p. 86, 87) relates a marvellous discoyety 
(A D 1046) of Pallas, the son of Evander, who had been slain by Turnus; life 
perpetual light in his sepulchre, a Latin epitaph, the corpse, yet .entire, of a 
young giant, the enormous wound in his breast (pectus perforat ingens), etc.

been explored by some labourers, in digging a vineyard near the tem- 
ple, or convent, of the Minerva; but the impatient proprietor, who was 
tormented by some visits of curiosity, restored the unprofitable marble 
to its former grave. 73 The discovery of a statue of Pompey, ten feet 
in length, was the occasion of a lawsuit. It had been found under a 
partition wall: the equitable judge had pronounced, that the head should 
be separated from the body to satisfy the claims of the contiguous 
owners; and the sentence would have been executed if the intercession 
of a cardinal, and the liberality of a pope, had not rescued the Roman 
hero from the hands of his barbarous countrymen. 74 

But the clouds of barbarism were gradually dispelled; and the peace- 
ful authority of Martin the Fifth and his successors restored the orna- 
ments of the city as well as the order of the ecclesiastical state. The 
improvements of Rome, since the fifteenth century, have not been the 
spontaneous produce of freedom and industry. The first and most 
natural root of a great city is the labour and populousness of the adja- 
cent country, which supplies the materials of subsistence, of manufac- 
tures, and of foreign trade. But the greater part of the Campagna of 
Rome is reduced to a dreary and desolate wilderness: the overgrown 
estates of the princes and the clergy are cultivated by the lazy hands 
of indigent and hopeless vassals; and the scanty harvests are confined 
or exported for the benefit of a monopoly. A second and more artificial 
cause of the growth of a metropolis is the residence of a monarch, the . 
expense of a luxurious court, and the tributes of dependent provinces. 
Those provinces and tributes had been lost in the fall of the empire; 
and if some streams of the silver of Peru and the gold of Brazil have 
been attracted by the Vatican, the revenues of the cardinals, the fees 
of office, the oblations of pilgrims and clients, and the remnant of 
ecclesiastical taxes, afford a poor and precarious supply, which main- 
tains, however, the idleness of the court and city. The population of 
Rome, far below the measure of the great capitals of Europe, does not 
exceed one hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants; 75 and within 
the spacious enclosure of the walls, the largest portion of the seven hills 
is overspread with vineyards and ruins. The beauty and splendour of 
the modern city may be ascribed to the abuses of the government, toi 

If this fable rests on the slightest foundation, we may pity the bodies, as well 
as the statues, that were exposed to the air in a barbarous age.

*In the year 1709 the inhabitants of Rome (without including eight or ten 
thousand Jews) amounted to 138,568 souls (Labat, Voyages en Espagne et en 
Italie, torn. m. p. 217, 218). In 1740 they had increased to 146,080; and in 1765

THE ROMAN EMPIRE 879 

the influence of superstition. Each reign (the exceptions are rare) has 
been marked by the rapid elevation of a new family, enriched by the 
childless pontiff at the expense of the church and country. The palaces 
of these fortunate nephews are the most costly monuments of elegance 
and servitude: the perfect arts of architecture, painting, and sculpture, 
have been prostituted in their service; and their galleries and gardens 
are decorated with the most precious works of antiquity, which taste or 
vanity has prompted them to collect. The ecclesiastical revenues were 
more decently employed by the popes themselves in the pomp of the 
Catholic worship; but it is superfluous to enumerate their pious founda- 
tions of altars, chapels, and churches, since these lesser stars are eclipsed 
by the sun of the Vatican, by the dome of St. Peter, the most glorious 
structure that ever has been applied to die use of religion. The fame 
of Julius the Second, Leo the Tenth, and Sixtus the Fifth, is accom- 
panied by the superior merit of Bramante and Fontana, of Raphael 
and Michael Angelo; and the same munificence which had been dis- 
played in palaces and temples was directed with equal zeal to revive 
and emulate the labours of antiquity. Prostrate, obelisks were raised 
from the ground, and erected in the most conspicuous places; of the 
eleven aqueducts of the Caesars and consuls, three were restored; the 
artificial rivers were conducted over a long series of old or of new 
arches, to discharge into marble basins a flood of salubrious and re- 
freshing waters: and the spectator, impatient to ascend the steps of St. 
Peter's, is detained by a column of Egyptian granite, which rises be- 
tween two lofty and perpetual fountains to the height of one hundred 
and twenty feet. The map, the description, the monuments of ancient 
Rome, have been elucidated by the diligence of the antiquarian and 
the student; 70 and the footsteps of heroes, the relics, not of superstition, 
but of empire, are devoutly visited by a new race of pilgrims from the 
remote and once savage countries of the North. 

Of these pilgrims, and of every reader, the attention will be excited 
by a History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire; the great- 
est, perhaps, and most awful scene in the history of mankind. The 

"The Pere Montfaucon distributes his own observations into twenty days, 
he should have styled them weeks, or months, of his visits to the different 
parts of the city (Diarium Italicuni, c. 8-20, p. 104-301). That learned Bene- 
dictine reviews the topographers of ancient Rome; the first efforts of Blondus&gt; 
Fulvius, Martianus, and Faunus, the superior labours of Pyrrhus Ligorius, 
had his learning been equal to his labours; the writings of Onuphrius Pan* 
vinius, qui omnes obscuravit, and the recent but imperfect books of Donatus 
and Nardini. Yet Montfaucon still sighs for a more complete plan and de- 
scription of the old city, which must be attained by the three following raetfi- 
ods: i. The measurement of the space and intervals of the rums. 2. The 
study of inscriptions and the places where they were found. 3- The investiga- 
tion of all the acts, charters, diaries of the middle ages, which name any spot 
or building of Rome. The laborious work, such as Montfaucon desired, must 
be promoted by princely or public munificence: but the great modern plan ef 
Nolli (AJD. 1748) would furnish a solid and accurate basis for the ancient 
topography of Rome. 



88c THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

various causes and progressive effects are connected with many of the 
events most interesting in human annals: the artful policy of the Cae- 
sars, who long maintained the name and image of a free republic; the 
disorders of military despotism; the rise, establishment, and sects of 
Christianity; the foundation of Constantinople; the division of the 
monarchy; the invasion and settlements of the barbarians of Germany 
and Scythia; the institutions of the civil law; the character and re- 
ligion of Mohammed; the temporal sovereignty of the popes; the res- 
toration and decay of the Western empire of Charlemagne; the cru- 
sades of the Latins in the East; the conquests of the Saracens and 
Turks; the ruin of the Greek empire; the state and revolutions of Rome 
in the middle age. The historian may applaud the importance and va- 
riety of his subject; but, while he is conscious of his own imperfections, 
he must often accuse the deficiency of his materials. It was among 
the ruins of the Capitol that I first conceived the idea of a work which 
has amused and exercised near twenty years of my life, and which, how- 
ever inadequate to my own wishes, I finally deliver to the curiosity and 
candour of the public. 

LAUSANNE, 

June 37, 1787. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE BBi 



AUTHORITIES 

The ancient authorities to which Gibbon had recourse in preparing 
his great work were as follows: 

I. DION CASSIUS, whose History of Rome from the earliest time to 
his own day is a work of immense value. He completed it in eighty 
books, but of this work there are only extant Books xxxvi.-lx., covering 
the period 68 B.C. to 60 A.D. Zonaras, however, whose Epitome is ex- 
tant, was largely indebted to the earlier books, and we have a number 
of fragments of the other books in the Excerpta de Virtutibus et Vitiis 
and the Excerpta de Legationibus, compilations authorised to be made 
in the tenth century by Constantine VII. Xiphilin also made, in the 
eleventh century, an abridgment of the last twenty books, save in Book 
Ixx. which is amissing in his abridgment. 

II. HERODIAN, whose work Histories of the Empire after, Marcus em- 
braced in the eight books the reigns from Commodus to Gordianus III. 

III. THE HISTORIA AUGUSTA is aptly styled by Bury " a composite 
work in which six different authors, who lived and wrote in the reigns 
of Diocletian and Constantine, had a hand," viz., (i) ^ELIUS SPAB- 
TIANUS who, at the order of Diocletian, wrote a series of Imperial bi- 
ographies, including the Caesars and tie Augusti, as far as Caracalla 
(2) VULCACIUS GALLICANUS wrote a work on the lives of the emperors 
who bore the title of Augustus. (3) TREBELLIUS POLLIO wrote the lives 
of all the emperors from the two Philips, reaching as far as Claudius 
and his brother Quintillus. (4) FLAVIUS VOPISCUS continued the work 
of Pollio, carrying it down as far as the death of Carinus and accession 
of Diocletian. (5) JULIUS CAPITOLINUS also wrote a series of Imperia) 
biographies, but many of them are lost. The earliest extant one is thai 
of Antoninus Pius, the latest Maximus and Balbinus. (6) J&amp;LTVS LAM* 
PRIDIUS wrote Imperial biographies, which he dedicated to Constantine, 
He began with Commodus and reached Alexander Severus. 

IV. SEXTUS AURELIUS VICTOR was the governor of the second Pan- 
nonia, being appointed by the Emperor Julian in 361. He was thought 
to have written a long History of the Roman Emperors now lost, of 
which the Ccesares (still extant) is an abridgment. 

V. EUTROPIUS was the Magister Memories at the court of Valens, to 
whom he dedicated his Short Roman History. 

VI RUFUS FESTUS, also a Magister Memories to Valens. His vol- 
ume was written about 369 A.D., because he refers to the great victory 
over the Goths gained by Valens in that year. 

VII L C^LIUS LACTANTIUS FIRMIANUS lived in the reigns of Dio- 
cletian and Constantine at Nicoinedia, where he taught rhetoric. Later 



882 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF 

in life he acted as tutor to Constantine's son Crispus. His works were 
chiefly theological. The most important is the De Mortibus Pcrscru- 
torum, written about 314 A.D. and relating the deaths of those who per- 
secuted the Christians. Doubts have been thrown on the authorship, 
but no satisfactory reason has been assigned which would lead one in 
withdraw the volume from the works of Lactantius. 

VIII. EUSEBIUS OF CESAREA. He succeeded to the chronographic 
work of Sextus Julius Africanus, who (as Bury says) flourished in the 
early part of the third century, and wrote his chronographic work be- 
tween 212 and 221 A.D. The Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius corrects 
the numerous errors which occur in the " Chronographies " of Afri- 
canus. The latter began his chronicle with Adam, but Eusebius with 
Abraham. 

LIBANIUS, who lived from 314-395 (c.) A.D., was another authority 
to which Gibbon was under great obligations; also the " Orations " of 
Themistius who was a friend of Libanius. 

AMMIANUS MARCELLINUS was a native of Antioch where he was born 
about 330, and went through all Julian's campaigns. His Res Gestce in 
thirty-one books are of value as throwing the light of contemporary 
ideas on the events of the time. He was known to have been alive in 
391 A.P. 

EUNAPIUS OP SARDIS (347-414 A.D.) wrote a continuation of the 
"Chronicle of Dexippus" from 270-404 A.D.; also the Lives of the 
" Philosophers and Sophists." 

ZOSIMUS who, as L. Mendelssohn has shown, was a Count and an ex- 
advocate fisci, wrote his history between the dates 450-501 A.D. 

IDATIUS or HYDATIUS, a Spaniard, wrote the Consular Fasti, which 
consists of three parts, the first extending from the first Consuls to the 
founding of Constantinople, 330 A.D.; the second from 330-395 A.D.; 
the third from 395-468. As Mommsen points out, the first two parts 
are an abridgment of the Ckronicon Paschale. 

Then we have the four Greek ecclesiastical historians, who flourished 
in the first half of the fifth century: 

PHILOSTORGIUS, born 365 (c.), died 412. His Ecclesiastical History 
is unfortunately only known by Photius's epitome of it in the ninth 
century. 

SOCRATES, who was a native of Constantinople, brought down his 
History to 439 A.D. He was an orthodox writer as also was 

SOZOMEN, his contemporary, who intended to trace the History of the 
Church from 324 to 439, where Socrates ended, but the work as it has 
come down to us ends in 425, the last books having been lost. 



THE ROMAN EMPIRE 883 

THEODORET, who, like Socrates and Sozomen, was also orthodox, 
wrote his History, which comes down to 429 A.D., between 441 and 
449 A.D. 

SYNESIUS OF CYRENE (360-415 c.), the friend of Aurelian, was con- 
verted to Christianity under Theophilus of Alexandria and became 
Bishop of Ptolemais. Was a satirist, a poet, and a letter-writer, in 
which occur valuable descriptions of the period. 

PALLADIUS, Bishop of Helenopolis, wrote a biographical work on 
John Chrysostom, also short biographies of men and women contempo- 
rary with him who had followed the ascetic rule. This was called His- 
toria Lausiaca. 

OLYMPIODORUS, the Pagan of Thebes (in Egypt), wrote a valuable 
History in twenty-two books. Unluckily it is no longer extant, but ex- 
tracts have been preserved in Photius's Bibliotheca. Other valuable 
works of this period are the fragments of the History of PRISCUS OP 
PANIUM in Thrace, whobe History began about A.D. 435 and continued 
down to 474, and whom Bury considers as the best historian of the 
fifth century; also Q, AURELIUS SYMMACHUS, born about 340 and died 
about 405, whose work? consist of nine books of letters descriptive of 
the age; also DECIUS MAGNUS AUSONIUS, born about 310 A.D. at Burdi- 
gala and died c. 395, whose poems reflect the customs of the time with 
rare fidelity; PONTIUS PAULINUS OF NOLA (354-431), who wrote a de- 
scription of the Churches of the time, and in his poems limned the chief 
characters of the age; PAULINUS OF PELLA, his father, was Praetorian 
Praefect of Illyricum, and wrote a valuable poem. Eucharisticon Deo 
Sub epkemerdis mete textu gives an interesting description of Aquitania 
at the time of Ataulfs invasion; also CLAUDIUS CLAUDIANUS, the cele- 
brated poet, born probably at Alexandria where he lived and wrote, 
being the laureate of Honorius from about 396-404; and AURELIUS 
PRUDENTIUS CLEMENS, who was at once the earliest and the greatest of 
the Christian poets. His Contra Symmachum is a most important work 
from an historical sense, dealing with the victory over Alaric at Pollen- 
tia. Another great Christian poet was FLAVIUS MEROBAUDES, whose 
Carmina are of great value. Other chronicles for the period are that of 
PROSPER TIRO of Aquitaine, who compiled an Epitome Chronicon, also 
the Chronica Gallica and the Chronica Itdica (made up of the Fasti 
Vindobonenses and the Continuation of Prosper, etc.), while Gibbon 
unquestionably drew much of his material for the fourth and fifth cen- 
turies from the work of PAULUS OROSIUS of Tarraco, Histories adversum 
Paganos, the De Gubernatione Dei of SALVIAN, and the Ecclesiastical 
History of TYRANNIUS RUFINUS. 

In the fifth, sixth, and seventh centuries Malchus of Philadelphia, 
Eustathius of Epiphania, Hesychius of Miletus, Theodoros Anagnostes, 
Procopius of Oesarea (whose Secret History 'and Military History are 
of priceless value), Agathias of Myrina, Joannes Rhetor, or Malalas, 



884 

John of Antioch, Joshua Stylites, Zacharias Rhetor, C. Apollinaris 
Sidonius, Cassidorus, Corippus, Victor Tonnennensis, Isidorus Junior, 
Gregory of Tours, have all been laid under levy by Gibbon; while the 
principal authorities consulted by Gibbon in the period dating from the 
eighth to the twelfth century are John of Ephesus, Evagrius, Theophy- 
lactus Simocattes, the poems of George Pisides (the Heradiad, etc.), 
Sebseos, John of Damascus, Nicephorus of Constantinople, Theodore of 
.Studion, George the Monk, Leo the Armenian, Joseph Gennesius, the 
Sicilian Chronicle, Leo Diacorus, Constantine Psellus, Michael Atta- 
leiates, Nicephorus Bryennius, Anna Comnena, John Cinnamus, Nice- 
tas Acominatos, John Scylitzes, John Zonaras, among Greek sources; 
and the Liber Pontificalis, Letters of Pope Gregory the Great, Paul the 
Deacon, Fredegarius; while for the Mohammedan period, the extant 
authorities which Gibbon consulted in addition to the Koran, were " The 
Life of Mohammed " by Al-Tabari, also by Wakidi, by Ibn Kutaiba, 
by Ibn Abd-al-Hakam, by Masudi, by Eutychius, John of Nikiu, Mi- 
chael of Mitylene, Bar Hebraeus, or Abulpfearagius. On the 9th- 1 4th 
Centuries Photius, Constantine Porphyrogennetos, George Codinus, 
Eustathius, George Acropolites, George Pachymeres, Nicephorus Blem- 
mydes, the Gesta Francorum, the Chronicle of Morea, Hugo Falcandus, 
Albert of Aachen, William of Tyre, Marshal Villehardouin, Nicetas, 
Abu-L-Fide, were all placed under contribution; while for the siege and 
fall of Constantinople the chief authorities relied on were Laonicus 
Chalcondyles, Ducas, George Phrantzes, Critobulus of Imbros, Min- 
haj-i-Siraj Juzjani, Mirza Haidar, the Yuan Shi, John Cananus, Cardi- 
nal Isidore, Leonardus of Chios, Phrantzes.
